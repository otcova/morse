I took Tom to Boston with me
I paid thirty bucks for this
I handed the document to Tom
Tom looks down on everybody
I was here with Tom all day
I took some pictures of Tom
A hat graced her head
Her head was graced by a hat
Her bag was very light
The situation is very complex
The candles shone brightly
He switched on the telly
He switched on the television
They took a day off
She took a day off
They were sacked
They were made redundant
They were laid off
They were discharged
You were sacked
You were made redundant
You were laid off
You were discharged
Tom switched the TV on
She was sacked
She was made redundant
She was laid off

He assumes everything
He takes it upon himself
It was clear he was lying
It was obvious he was lying
She read a prayer
I saw his car in his garage
I suggest we go out for coffee
They take care of each other
I know why that happened
Nobody says anything
I worried about that

Nobody ever tells me anything
Nobody could get in
I enjoyed your video
Nobody could get out
We have the advantage
I want to eat right now
My grandson is seven years old
I love him very much
I gave Tom two cookies

Tom is a scalawag
Tom is a house nigger
Tom is a carpetbagger
I hope I can get financial aid

Find something to do
No one could get out

The cat was asleep
It was a nice plan

He slowly opened his eyes
You should be outside
I hope you like the wine
That box is already full

We finally gave up
She took part in that meeting
She attended that meeting
He writes engaging novels
He left soon after we arrived
You pay at the checkout
You pay at the till
You pay at the cash desk
The autumn moon is beautiful
Betty never had a violin case
Please give him my regards
Not a soul is here
We should look at the map
My bag needs mending
My bag has had it
We have to remember to do that
I bought a hat for Tom
I bought Tom a hat
I expected to be asked to sing
Hold your bloody horses
We had a difference of opinion
I expected this to be more fun
I expected something like that
There are always other offers

She erased him from her memory
Her back hurts
Tom never takes a train
The meeting is next Thursday
Pay for whatever you want
I expected to get here sooner
Foma is my younger brother
I must ask you to excuse me

I only asked one question
Our grandmother has many dogs
I expected something else
My student had a cat
This is a city in our country

This is not his phone
This really is a masterpiece

I sang a duet with Tom
Tom is feeding the dog
Reeds are very nutritious

I have a favour to ask of you
I bought something for dinner
I assume Tom went back inside
I attended a party last night
I handed a shovel to Tom
I handed Tom a shovel
I went to the police station
I want a box about this size
I got help
I wrote a book about Australia
I drank wine
I need a desk
Tom approached the door
I was on edge
I need a table
I checked my oil
The prisoners must be released
We use only natural materials
Doubt weighs on my soul
I lowered my gun
Tom is burdened by loneliness
We hid our faces
I rarely go there
I locked the doors
I lowered my sword
I got here a long time ago
I have nothing to do with this
Keep on training
I know everyone in the picture
I drank a few beers
I identified myself
Stand in a straight line
Johano looked at a cow
I laughed nervously
I would like to taste them
I am in bed with a fever
A girl has a fever
I will eat your bananas
I asked Tom to move his car
I wrote five letters to her

I pried off the lid
I pried the lid off
Every bird has its song
Please stop at the bus stop
I quickly responded
Tom accepted the gifts
You must fulfil your tasks
Tom is a bad eater
I believe the rain is over
I ran to the garage
I sat near the door
I entered the forest
I heard a gun go off
I never had a choice
I ran into the woods
We need to know that
I cracked open a beer
I fell quickly asleep
I hid behind the door
My life does not belong to me
I left my car running
I pried the door open
I ran to the bus stop
My dog is bigger than yours
I brought a flashlight
We speak Swedish
I flipped on the light
I had a lovely evening
I have my own computer
I have tons of friends
I kicked the door open
I left the blinds open
Tom lost his sight
Tom has lost his sight
Tom only speaks one language
Tom sells radios
I like vampire stories
I opened the back door
Ducks make great pets
I crouched on all fours
The last stretch was brutal
The last section was brutal
Maybe you should drink less
The books fell from the shelf
The books fell off the shelf
The shelf was mounted badly
The shelf was put up badly
The season is over for him
His season is over
He says he was fouled
He has been sent off
He has been sent off the pitch
He has shown him the red card
He showed him the red card
The defender has fouled him
The defender fouled him
He will be out for two months
He injured his wrist
The match was stopped
The game was stopped
The game was interrupted
He looked like a mummy
His foot was bandaged as well
They bandaged his head
They put a bandage on his head
He prevented a lot of goals
He made a lot of saves
She has injured her hand
She injured her hand
He has sprained his ankle
She has injured her shoulder
She injured her shoulder
He fell awkwardly
He has fallen awkwardly
The holidays are coming up
I dropped my flashlight
I heard a buzzing noise
I know who that girl is
I pried the window open
I put my car in reverse
I recognized that woman
It did not rain yesterday
In winter I leave home at nine
I left the curtains open
I never went there again
I opened the garage door
Tom and I hung out for a while
We waited for her
That is a teacher
That is an older letter
It is too early to depart
Every day is a new beginning
I followed Tom into his office
The Earth is our home
I drove across the bridge
I decided to go back to Boston
I knew nothing about that
My dog is a poodle
I always wake up early
I leaned against the tree
We have a black dog
Sami is a Chenoui
I called Tom a few more times
I told Tom to go to his room
Tom is here alone
I was talking about myself
I never got a reply from Tom
She broke my favorite guitar
God bless you and your family
I met Tom at the supermarket
I like horse sausages
I crouched behind the bush
I did that when Tom was here
I headed back to the cabin
I ran to the train station
I listened carefully to Tom
I was absolutely terrified
I shared my lunch with Tom
I can still hear that noise
I saw Tom throw something
I eventually got used to it
I knew that Tom was there
I felt safe inside the cave
I heard something behind me
I heard the doorknob jiggle
I picked Tom up downtown
I knocked on the front door
I decided to tell on Tom
I locked the door behind me
I headed back to Boston
Tom is a creepy person
I helped Tom get ready
Terrific guy
I bought some food for lunch
I gave Tom a thumbs up
I have to see your hand
I decided to call the police
I decided to stay on the bus
I contacted Tom again
I heard the same noise again
I kept Tom waiting
I danced with Tom
You do know I hate her
I crouched beneath the window
I ran past Tom
I obeyed Tom
I got up early to go fishing
Tom lives in Maryland
I asked for something to eat
I got up early to play golf
We have no rules
I asked somebody to help me
I left my pack in your car
Come to Boston with us
I asked someone to help me
I asked only one question
They are gorillas
Intellect is not wisdom
I left my bag on the bus
I lost a lot of time with you
It was a lot of fun
I asked for more details
I majored in philosophy
I expected this result
I saw a frog on the road
The doctor cured him
I ran back to my car
I will come of age next year
Justice will be restored

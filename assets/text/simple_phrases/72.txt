I went there alone
I want to have an aspirin
My coat has two pockets
This table is made of plastic
I pulled up the potatoes
My cat is really beautiful
The house is too big for us

You went everywhere
This is a skirt
Someone brought you something
My computer broke
Because he is sleepy
I was raised Catholic
I am not impressing them
Tom is cleaning out the garage
I get confused easily

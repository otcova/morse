The conditions are not ideal
He should already be there
She should already be here
She should be here by now
It rained again today
There are no potatoes left
There are no more potatoes
Ali is as sly as a fox
Today I saw an albino squirrel
We should toast
She saw it all
She saw the whole thing

I showed off my scars
I was showing my scars
I showed my scars
Tom has never changed a diaper
Pick a film
I know that
One murder makes a villain
Millions a hero
Poor dog
I will put them aside
You were a hot mess back then
Do not ask me for forgiveness

That figures
Keep an eye on Tom
Both are correct
I love these grapes
She likes to shake boxes
Violence is never an answer
Tom is an accomplished person
I lost the list
I pushed him out the window
That hat is mine
My parents are still young
Give me a sandwich
Tom works at a car wash
The list was handwritten
Your handwriting is terrible
Send me a copy of the report
Initial here
A river of tears and fire
We drink
I asked fearfully
There are no restrictions
Their parents are dead
I want to be somebody else
I was too short
Have a look outside

No one survived the crisis
His attitude is praiseworthy
Her attitude is praiseworthy
Bill went in and checked
Hush up and finish your work
A magnificent view
He sat on the bench and smoked

Remember to buy mayo
The child cried
Open it carefully

Sorry for causing you to wait
Sorry for making you wait
Sorry for the wait
This is the saddest thing
Use shampoo
Please add it to my account
He has no objections
Sweets give me headaches
Good night
I am often depressed
He washes my dog
The car needed a jump
That fan blows hot air
The fan is making noise
The fan is set incorrectly
Watch out for puddles
Look at that pool of blood
I wonder what made Tom do it
Tom likes caring for animals
The bird was about that big
The fish was about that big
It was about that big
Many pigeons
Many rats
Tom never regretted anything
Tom will be sick if he eats it
She has no girlfriend
I want to run away
I will call you on Friday

She lay down until the morning
And Samuel told him everything
I ran all the way from there

Tom has hairy hands
Kabylia is free
Mary wants to see Kabylia
Kabylia is a land of olives
He gets distracted easily
I recently baked a cake
Ask him if he wants to come
It has enough salt

He motioned to me to go to him
They idolise Tom
I told you where to go
We applauded the musicians
For her he seemed out of reach
I hate this person
Tom hates mediocrity
You owe a lot of money
It must have been another
Use the chance to thank her

Sorry about that
Here

That path is impassable
Sorry about last time
The road forks here

The game went into extra time
The match went to extra time
The game went to extra time
Good job he was there
He is about thirty years old
We are doing great
The hill provides a good view

I buy a lot of erasers
If only this were true
I wish this were true
This man is very rude
We need to speak out now
The market was crowded
She sounded confused
Tom played with his sons
He tasted a fig
Tom has a fungal infection
I deserve to be thanked
I remained alone

He must have gone out
He has gone travelling again
It seems he was short of money
We spoke in sign language

He hastily finished eating
He finished his food hurriedly
He hurriedly finished eating
The clocks change on Sunday
I ordered a book from England
He simply left without paying
He just left without paying

Tell your friend to go there
Chuck it in the wash
It requires a hectare of land
She asked Mary to stop smoking
We were really very tired

He pretended to be rich
I want to stand out much more
Joe Biden was falling asleep
I hate bureaucracy
That cracks me up
There are dragons there
This city used to be beautiful

The cinema was completely full
People write to be read
Bolt the door
Look at that koala there
Your pulse is a little fast
I drive a black van
Tom was born on a starship

This is a basement
I just found out
You will be informed
It is an integer
She wants to do nothing
I plan on doing nothing
Nothing can be done about that
I tried to know my soul
It could be just as you say
It might be just like you say
No one understood a thing
Some are against it
A few are against it
It is not yet dry
The disease can be prevented
Imports exceeded exports
I only want to look at it
I just want to look at him
Worms can be good for the soil
I no longer drink
He has no experience
Dad watered the flowers
He lives here alone
I barely have time to prepare
It was everything I wanted
The tubes are in the walls
The pipes are in the walls
We eat slowly
The worst virus is ignorance
I have to go eat

My children fill me with pride
Give me back my heart

He spent his nights awake
She would lie awake at night
In that order

You speak English
The way back was hard
Relax
The soft bread is tasty
This led to further problems
I must be getting older
Tom made no mention of it
She made no mention of it
Mary made no mention of it
Everyone helped each other
Tom returned the lost wallet
Everyone helps each other
The people are very friendly
The world is improving
The students helped each other
People shared what they had
Most people are kind
She simply had no alternative
She simply had no choice
You seem a long way away
The fox came down the path
The fox came along the path
Feel free to have a look round
You should know
You should know
You should know
This is worthless
It would be better not to ask
I do not intend to quit at all
She never phoned me
He died without a will
That smells like cheese
Taxes are just legal robbery
Cats have two eyes
Mary tore up the newspaper
I will be visiting Athens
This is empty
This bottle is empty
Let me Google it using Bing

I have to scrub the floors
In art the best is good enough
The movie theater was packed
A few people were ice skating
Those two are quarreling again
She holds the boy back
She restrains the boy
She detains the boy
My anger has ended already
Stop fidgeting and sit quietly
I propose to simplify it
I love veal
A scandal is brewing
A conflict is brewing

Tom was a preposterous peasant
I live in Siberia
I fit inside that box
I can fit into that box
We should make a backup ASAP
This box is made of metal

We should always be careful
I was fired yesterday
Tom is just your average Joe
It was wrong
My parents come from Australia
My wallet was stolen by Tom
Grab harder
Grip tighter

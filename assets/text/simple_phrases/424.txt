I have to pee
I was often ill as a child
Tom signalled for me to leave
I just miss you so much
Hang the washing out
Look after the house
I go for a walk every day
We thought Tom was asleep
A light breeze is blowing
Eat as much as you want
His writings inspire me
They are not really apples
The brain is like a muscle
The gangsters started shooting
I know every inch of this city
Tom knows every inch of Boston
Tom is every inch a gentleman
I want to try more
Tom is afraid of the dog
I left well in advance
Tom has a cat and two dogs

My ankles are swollen
It is to the left
You can find it to the left
It is to the right
You can find it to the right

Make a right turn
Go along the street
Go along the road

I want that product

The killer is among us
Ask her any question in German

He has very few things
My left arm hurts

Tom goes to a state school
This is a state school

The weather is just beautiful
Drive slowly on the bridge
He often acts without thinking
Maybe it was for the best
It has damaged his reputation
It damaged his reputation
This chick is kinda sketchy
Marcus failed miserably
He has very soft features
He has very gentle features
It was a justifiable shooting
Let me draw a map for you
Let me draw you a map
It becomes a vicious cycle

That show should be canceled
They should cancel that show
Stay away from the controls
No need
Nothing knows
Teach me why
You should be a gymnast

Please switch the light off
The group continued working

They asked us to stay here
The meeting went pretty bad
Tom bugged Mary with questions
She gave me my money back
Let yourself go completely
Love is a wonderful thing
I felt like smiling

Time had passed in a blur
I love sex too much
We have a modest house
You know you like me
You know I like you
His goons are here to kill us
Cat communication is subtle
My ID card has expired
She phoned everyone she knew
She rang up everyone she knew
Whatever
By no means is he petty
You had grabbed branches
It was a painful defeat
She stood between the boys
Marcus helped almost every day
Fascism is bad
The car pulled into the kerb
The car mounted the kerb
Not everyone is ready to die
He still has a boyish face
A lot of people say that
These guys have no opinion
Hate the game
I hoovered the car
I felt a big disappointment
He offered me dinner
Follow the street
Follow the road
He took a sip of beer
Shut the fuck up
He gave each person a pencil
I was deeply shaken by that
It shook me deeply
That shook me deeply
Just wait a bit
Just wait a bit longer
Anna is hypersensitive
Give me it
I can juggle with four balls
I try to concentrate
I vacuumed the car
You should eat more slowly
Pride goeth before a fall
That work is almost finished
That work is almost done
That job is just about done
That work is mostly done
No one says that here
Take a right at the next light
Keep drinking

He beat the crap out of me
Enough of this talk
Read what it says

It remains to be seen
Sam lives in a block of flats
He cheated in the Biology exam
You have to queue

They had promised it
Do not abnegate your authority
The tracks end here
The road ends here
I want to redeem myself
I want to expiate my guilt
The wind is subsiding
The wind is dying down
Not very spicy
Not very piquant

Stop blaming each other
I know what their weakness is
Take my advice
He soon came back
I never mentioned his name

I fear his reaction
She was wearing a black bra
I grew my hair for her
No mole could be blinder
We boated down the river
Breading makes the food crispy
He looked daggers at me
He finally gave up the ghost
He has pulled through
It gets you going
Her body ached all over
He died a natural death
Tom raises chickens for meat
He has found a kindred spirit
This is where our ways part
She gave me the eye
He took a fancy to her
She took his fancy
I got an eyeful
She has bedroom eyes
She played footsie with me
They laughed themselves silly
They laughed their heads off
It became habit
Tom goes to nursery school
Tom is at school at the moment
Tom learned French at school
This school has many pupils
The storm caused a power cut
The supplies will run out soon
They queued for the bus
They left us with no choice
I went back into the house
I agree with her
Tom gave a loud sigh
Tom sighed audibly
I spoke in a whisper
I speak very fast
I broke a knuckle on his tooth
Look under the fingernail
Life has cornered me
His pinky is blue
Put your thumb on the scanner
Gently push back the cuticles
No doubt about it
There is no doubt about that
He crushes ice with his armpit
They exchanged ideas
Few people speak Toki Pona
I just said what I thought
They decided to press charges
The supplies will soon run out
It has become habit
His death was accidental
The gym is round the corner
He joined me in the kitchen
Keep a diary
Imagine that for a moment
Ali pulled his hood up
Tom works under me
This arouses my curiosity
The land yields abundant crops
Go visit your parents
Let me walk you to the station
This food reminds me of home
Please buy this book for me
You have business acumen
Tom opened the door wide
Tom threw open the door
Send Mary a lovely postcard
I cannot write verses
He was damn hot
I used to be much friendlier
Lovely jubbly
Not really
Thank you
I know you will
We came here to bring him home
We had to leave suddenly
The call dropped
He was very clear about that
Leave this penguin alone
He helped me carry the bag
She gently touched my arm
His condition is very serious
His fingers grazed my hand
These are your grapes
These apples are green
Those cars are green
I have to scrape the oven
Set one goal at a time
I hate housekeeping
I bite my lip and nod
I want him dead
I want him to die
I want to see him dead
Cool beans
I want to live to the fullest
I love modern art
Modern art is fine
It was literally now or never
He has a chequered past
Tom has a chequered past

Tom had designer stubble
He was stirring the stew
She helped me move on
Toot
Toot toot
I removed her bra
I kissed her on the neck
I kissed her neck
I squeezed her tits
She grabbed my cock
I kissed her belly
I want you inside me
We still need you
The universe is a hologram
We did all the math though
Much of Lulu Island was mud

I want to have your child

He started shivering
I woke up in a daze
I chalked it up to tiredness
I miss your caresses
I like telling dad jokes
Sometimes he laughs
Bake two dozen cored apples
Doing that became a habit
Her parents were furious
The storm caused power outages
They came to visit me
Then he made Mary quit her job
Tom just got out of work
Your propaganda stinks
You worry about really nothing
Try to be happy being alone
Get a cat or something
Everyone believed in us but us
This forum is not a chatroom
We were near your house
I think that you use drugs
I want to see him suffering
I think with a female brain
Freshly cut is best
This is not his first offense
This is not her first offense
I promise not to look
I promise not to peek
We were disfigured
Anna rushed into the kitchen
Everyone rushed to the exit
A goal is the orgasm of soccer
Pass me a Phillips screwdriver
He is out of control
He is uncontrollable
A human is a thinking being
The car pulled into traffic
He found it unmanly
I hate him with all my being
Today I fully accept who I am
I boldly accepted my identity
The video was deleted
I helped mom clear the table
I entered the elevator
She has bright teeth
Please tell us what that is
The long journey made me tired
The long drive made me tired
We should keep them far away
I wish you had never been born
Americans are fat
I like working from home
This is imported paper
I suggest you help Tom do that
Life makes no sense
Tom has been very unfair
Tom just got off work
Tom has just gotten off work
We want Tom to leave
Tom really needs to apologize
I also bought Tom some food
I bought Tom some food as well
The situation got very ugly
The situation became very ugly
We floated down the river
I know what Tom plans to do
We can visit Tom on Sunday
They beat the hell out of him
It beats me
She had the blues
She was in the doldrums
She was on a downer

He became a nurse
A wall surrounds the garden
He had to stop his research
He had to stop his research
Tom later apologised
I have a passion for furniture
Alice goes to bed at ten
I love him even more
Apparently Tom bit his friend
You made me hate this city
Please just leave me alone
My heart beat strongly
I am my battles
I am my struggles
May he rest in peace
I can be myself with him
I felt a lot of sadness
This flower only grows here
You drank your cup of coffee
The tension grew suddenly
I like discovering new things
We drove Tom to the hospital
Tom was still on the moon
The situation became ugly
The situation got ugly
Tom violated a law
The typhoon blew our roof off
I started crying with joy
Tom adamantly opposed the plan
Cats are very cute
This is an ancient castle
Frugality is a virtue
We are scared
You love him
I can see it in your eyes
I will be watching television
I am the sole survivor
Look around you
Admire the calm of the ocean
Not all clouds bring rain
I need to be more agile
That colour looks good on you
He considers me his property
We always said no sex
I shaved my beard carefully
My cell phone is ringing
I packed as fast as I could
I left the windows ajar
I have cramp in my calf
I had to have a molar out
They never have enough money
It has a certain charm
He has a certain charm
She brought me food in bed
I helped him tie his tie
I like both science and maths
You should pop round
You should come round
I did what I came to do
I just did what I wanted to do
I did what I did for Tom
We did what we needed to do
These kinds of things happen
We have to face reality
We skied a lot last winter
We all saw the accident
Tom is learning to drive
Think about how Tom feels
We need to talk
I bought two types of beer
I bought two kinds of beer
We are not so shortsighted
The milk is white
The carrot is orange
The dress is blue
Thieves steal
Tom likes playing with cats

All cats are grey in the dark
You must work more
You are to come with me
You seem an honest man
You are way off track
You are free to go out
You are to do as I tell you
You are tallest
You are apt to be forgetful
You are to do it at once
You are now among the elite
Your son has come of age
Your watch is ten minutes slow
I as well as you am to blame
You must keep your shoes clean
My muscles have become soft
I have an itchy crotch
I start in surprise
I saw a boat above the bridge
I intended to become a teacher
Teaching is learning
Fear robbed him of speech
A strong wind began to set in
The wind blew in gusts
Robbers wrecked the mail train
The slugger was easily put out
The strong winds were blowing
The society made him president
Supply is relative to demand
A huge tanker put off just now
I had a miscarriage last year
I had otitis media last year
The crops failed last year
Out of sight out of mind
Milk easily turns sour
Milk is made into butter
Blend milk and eggs together
He will wriggle out of the fix
The ball slightly curved
Misfortunes never come singly
We just have to swallow it
Crying is of no avail
It only adds fuel to the fire
I burst into tears
Mr Itoh will call the roll
Here comes the bus
The holiday ended all too soon
He is lively during recess
Too much rest is rust
The hill lay covered with snow
We came in sight of the hill
The customer did not come
Smoking is harmful to health
Smoking has affected his lungs
Women will have the last word
Parliament has been dissolved
Hypocrisy is my abhorrence
Hunger knows no law
Hunger impelled him to crime
You need not have woken me up
You are much too kind to me
You lent a book
You have a telephone
You study Chinese history
You go to the Chikushi river
You drink tea
You like balls
Your tap water is too hard
Get a water softener
Your dog has worms
Give him vitamins
He was created a peer
I read about All Ball
I really enjoy the climate
Care aged him quickly
Worry affected his health
Take heart and do it again
The weather is fickle
Never mind
Anyone can make mistakes
Caring means being alive
I just brush it off
Wit gives zest to conversation
You must feed the machine
The restaurant was a bummer
I am tied to my desk and chair
Joy was mingled with sorrow
Her face was animated by joy
I came near to being drowned
I barely missed being struck
You look pale
My cheeks burn
Silence grows like cancer
The logs flamed brightly
It is you who is in the wrong
You better believe it
Easter will soon come around
Send me the account
Brevity is the soul of wit
Nurses attend sick people
Kanji are difficult to read
The shouting echoes loud
Shouts of joy burst forth
The cheers swelled to a roar
I was moved to tears
The bill was paid in coin
The patient was allowed up
Perfection is a trifle dull
It cannot be completely cured
I have very bad chills
Cold winter came on
Cold weather is coming
The Kamo runs through Kyoto
The stock market tumbled
The eagle does not catch flies
My forehead burned with fever
Wipe the sweat from your brow

The band paraded the streets
I wish you a pleasant voyage
Pleasure is the source of pain
The pupils burst out laughing
Students are apt to waste time
Study the student more

Three students
He is proud of his scholarship
I graduated from the school
Not worth the remembered value
Remember it
He did not get any game
The expansion is aging
Each man must cast a vote
External application only
Foreigners admire Mt
Fuji
It was piercingly cold outside
Please invite us out to dinner
May you all be happy
Each is good in its degree
With kind regards to you all
The sea was truly calm
The sea was running high
The sea is far from calm
The sea is very wide
I cast my net into the sea
The sea is down
The sea came into sight
The sea indented the coastline
The sun rose from the sea
The sea is not clear
Turtles live to a great age
It is never too late to mend
There go the twelve bars blues
The Sphinx howled with rage
There was a thick fog around

The company is in deficit
The meeting will commence
The conference closed at five
Fix a date for the meeting
The members decreased to five

We basked in his favor
We expect much of him
We work by the day
We prevailed over our enemy
We must die sooner or later
We are forty three in all
We are against war
We sang songs in chorus
We need to nourish our spirit
We are longing for world peace
We compare life to a journey
We deepened our friendship
They gained a victory
We said we should win
We stand for liberty
We are to preserve nature
We cannot subdue nature
We toiled up a hill
We deal in silk goods
We are facing a violent crisis
We came upon them in New York
We must know about it
We balloted for the resolution
We gave the performer a clap
We spoke to no purpose
We are looking to you for help
Our advance was checked
Ours is a mechanical age
Our plan was fully realized
Our team has the game on ice
There is nothing like home
Our team came home in triumph
Tom bats cleanup on our team
Send your baggage in advance
I have an allergy to pollen
The vase crashed to pieces
The flowers are still in bud
Blossoms develop from buds
The flower will come out soon
Insure your house against fire
Keep the fire alive
Be on your guard against fire
We sat over a fire
Fruits tend to decay soon
There is an abundance
Few flowers develop into fruit
Science rests upon observation
Chemistry gave us plastics
Science builds our lifestyle
Sleep and wait for good luck
I have peace at home
I rear cattle
The whole house was ill in bed
His whole family is like that
All my family is very well
I see the tower from my house
Summer vacation is near
Summer is gone
It is so humid in summer here
The summer heat is rolling in
Grass is luxuriant in summer
Take every possible means
Mr Kato is a teacher
Some stores discount the price
There are several flowers
No scam is too outrageous
Many times have I scolded him
Some were late
All things must have an end
I have no real intent
It is good for nothing
Few people are free of care
I ache for a sight of the sea
We just got to first base
I was at a loss what to say
I am entirely at your service
What marvelous weather
I have false nearsightedness
I got a rash from cosmetics
I have a touch of diarrhea
I have diarrhea
My lower abdomen feels bloated
Go downstairs and have a wash
Music has settled her nerves
Music feeds our imagination
Music gratifies the ears
Music affords us much pleasure
Music moves the feelings
The temperature falls
History has a lot to teach us
You left me in despair
I have her in my pocket
I gotta try to do my best
My love has gone far away
My papa said no
The roof is shining in the sun
The roof was dripping
Rain was pattering on the roof
I succeed to the throne
Kings have long arms
Send my greetings to your wife
My back tooth has chipped
Imagine that you have a wife
Down with corrupt politicians
Please clean the dirty floor
Salt is necessary for a cook
Salt is a useful substance
Salt preserves fish from decay
Any one will do
Not really
Distant things look blurred
Marriage is made in heaven
The banquet was in full swing
The yen rose to the dollar
The station is near at hand
No man is a hero to his valet
The English are a great nation
You had to study English
She surpasses me in English
How I wish I could swim
I should like to go for a swim
I had a sustaining breakfast
I adore going to the cinema
All the films are boring
The clouds are rolling away
The clouds are breaking
A cloud passed across the moon
Clouds sail across the sky
Exercise trains the muscles
The driver gestured him out
The rumor turned out false
The rumor soon went about
There are rumors in the air
I was made out to be a liar
The rain came down in earnest
The rain fell even harder
We are in for rain
It looks like rain
We had better shut the windows
Down came the rain in torrents
The rains entered a lull
The rain will revive this tree
It threatens to rain
Please share my umbrella
It has ceased raining
It has been raining
The roads are wet
The rain is raining all around
It rained five days on end
Feathers are peculiar to birds
There is no air in space
Space is full of mystery
Take the right road
Now lie still on your back
I drank too much
I was made to drink
The lightning flashed
I delivered identical twins
One book is thin
The other is thick
Give me chapter and verse
Learn a little at a time
Take three at a time
Youth comes but once in life
The worm turns
Within every man are thousands
It is lonely to live alone
Let us go together
Not a moment could be lost
The party arrived at Kyoto
The party fought their way up
Write on alternate lines
I will bite just a little bit
A word is enough to a wise man
The doctor felt his pulse
The doctor bound my wounds
The doctor had me lying in bed
The belly has no ears
My stomach feels heavy
Communication takes many forms
No offense was meant
Ill news comes apace
I am more beautiful than you
We drove to Hakone last Sunday
I want to buy a word processor
Lynn runs fast
The lions are in the cage
John testified concerning him
Good
No absentees
I must fly
I fear we are too late
All are happy
Everyone attacked my opinion
Have a cup of milk
It will do you good
Look at those two kissing
She looks easy
That is not my idea of him
Gotta paint it
Press the bell twice
French is spoken by many
I would like to go to France
Bill is two years older than I
The bus stopped sharply
I left my briefcase in the bus
This guarantees me par
The notebook came loose
The mucus is thick
In New York I lost my way
He managed to run the machine
What a big talk
Because he invited me
Because it is there
He is very much a scholar
Nylon stockings often run
I can see the tiniest spot
Any task may become painful
Take whatever cake you want
Take whichever flower you like
Please come dressed up
It is said that Tom has a cold
Tom is older than I
Tom is lost in the game
Every dog is alive
Have some lobster at any rate
I am in a stew
It tastes very great
It is an impossible accident
I would rather divorce him
It rains in some places
The toast has burned black
Every means has failed
Thanks
Please share my umbrella
Please come in one by one
Please have a try
Go ahead
Your party is on the line
I do want to go to Italy
You never ride it any more
Let me know the way
Please rid me of this pain
The door is opened by Jim
The TV picture was blurred
Please answer by telex
But I enjoyed farm work
Now she lay weak in bed
But I was always too lazy
Then let us begin
No one can match him at tennis
The tape is rolling
The data is often inaccurate
Mr Davis looks very tired
I bought a Daily News
Coffee finishes most dinners
The tundra has a harsh climate
He had a tuberculin test
The swallow is swift in flight
That only changed recently
You are burning up the road
Wait for a while
Chocolate tastes sweet
Bring me two pieces of chalk
Speak out
No gratuities accepted
Put everything on my tab
I want to buy a Czech sweater
I cannot dance worth a damn
Everyone is an entrepreneur
Let no one interfere with me
I want to get cigarettes
Smoking does you harm
I long for a smoke
Tobacco acts on the brain
Not a single word did he say
They are merely different
Not a word did he speak
Appear before us now
The kite went upward
Shake off the towels
Diamond is essentially hard
The timetable was disrupted
Most girls are kind
Put me in touch with her
Sleep off the problem
She must be a fool to say so
Give up such ideas
That excuse will not do
Put the plan on the scrap heap
To do so is asking for trouble
I cannot take less
Put it back in the nest
Get it and put it on the fire
Prove it by experiment
I shudder to think of it
Well do I remember it
Let it hang
It appeared to be a true story
It is too easy a task for him
It is he
It is still immoral
Off it went
The beginning showed it
I cannot stomach it
It was a poor concert
It was all our fault
It all came to nothing
It is called sick humor
It is characteristic of him
It needs exercise
Then she hurried home
The story affected us deeply
The train was overturned
Let the problem alone
The problem defies solution
Its name is Ken
I have read the book before
The soldiers turned traitor
The story concluded abruptly
That suit wears long
The dress becomes you
The article is genuine
The plane crashed suddenly
The farm grows potatoes
The cat ran away into the room
The cat is liked
The two meetings clash
The path is broken
The soil retained richness
The news was sensational
We are excited at the news
Everybody laughed at the boy
It is otherwise correct
The statue expresses freedom
The teacher grades easily
The girl appeared sick
The track descends
The victory excited us
The species faded away
None of your tricks
The ceremony was simple
The watch broke down
The facts are otherwise
We are familiar with the poem
He wants a playmate
We cannot do the work in a day
The ad really pulled
The dog went for the postman
The dog awoke to the danger
The artist exclaimed
The police are searching
The airport is in Osaka Bay
I like neither of the pictures
The flower is opening
Its value had trebled
The music lured everyone
I wish I had seen the film
He has the lead in the race
The apple tastes sweet
The butter smells good
The news paralyzed him
The news is fiction
The news spread abroad
The news spread fast
The doors fold back
I had a lick at the jam
The shirt needs pressing

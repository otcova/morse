The milk tastes sour
The hill commands a fine view
The top of the hill is flat
You can ski on that hill
The hill overlooked the sea

You must not go up the stairs
The picture set her wondering
The picture is true to life
The picture was wonderful
The picture is good in its way
The picture was wonderful
You ought to have seen it
I like neither of the pictures
The ghost story was terrifying

I wish I had seen the film
I found the film interesting
I remember seeing the movie
I missed seeing the film
I want to see the movie again
The movie was good
The movie was interesting
The film was a great success
The picture is on now
This movie is worth seeing
I found the film romantic
That movie is exciting
They have cast the movie
I was excited by the movie
The exercise took years off me
The rumor cannot be true
The rumor may be true
The rumor is only too true
The rumour has already spread
That rumor soon spread
The gossip hurt his reputation
The crow flew away
Read this passage
The blow made me see stars
One of them is gestures
The well is dry
The doctor has saved my life
The doctor is a man of culture
The ruins are worth visiting
I can make nothing of it

The notebook is not yours
The tie goes with your jacket
That tie looks good on you
Your tie looks good
The wet shirt will soon dry up
The news made her happy
The news paralyzed him
I felt like crying at the news
I heard the news on the radio

The dress suits you very well
The truck ran over a boy
The curtain was rising then
Then he came to his senses
The sun was coming up then
Only then did I realize it
I was eighteen then
Luck smiled on us then
I was happy then
I realized it only then
Mr Jones said something then
The boy turned around then
The doors fold back
The door is sometimes open
The door opened of itself
The door locks automatically
I bought the TV from her
The TV is on the blink
That TV is too loud

The athlete had a strong build
Hand me the wrench
The spy burned the papers
The steak is well done
The skirt is too wide for me
The soup needs more salt
The suit becomes him well
I am very pleased at the news
The show was wonderful
You should have seen it
The joke amused the audience
I had a lick at the jam
The shirt is large for me
The shirt needs pressing
The monkey climbed up a tree
The computer is of great use
The computer was very useful
The computer is new
The computer is up to date
The concert was broadcast live
I was only a little child then
Tell me about it
Keep it in mind
It is no good talking about it
Ponder deeply over it
The proverb is familiar
You can bet your boots on that
I heard it on good authority
Please think no more about it
The remark was aimed at you
You may have heard of that
The matter does not concern me
There is no doubt about it
I agree with you about that
Tell me everything about it
Take my word for it
That reminds me of my father
I want to talk to him about it
You are mistaken about that
The glass was dashed to pieces
There is a crack in the glass
That coffee smells good
The coat is not mine
It is fun to play baseball
The game drew a good crowd
I found the game easy
Tell me how to play the game
I wish we had won the game
Two can play at that game
The cake tastes sweet
The cakes may be sold out soon
I want some cake
The group was made up by Dick
That club is way too big
I found the glass empty
The glass is full of wine
The nail went through the wall
The campaign took his breath
Divide the candies among you
Carry the bags upstairs
The bag has been left behind
The bag was too heavy to carry
The cup is nice
The basket was full of apples
The cliff hangs over the sea
I regret eating those oysters
The gown is made of silk
The curtain wants cleaning
You will have heard the news
The money is due to him
The money has not been used up
None of the money is yours
The policeman is on duty
The old lady believes him rich
It removes misunderstandings
The engine will not pull
The engine is driven by steam
The rumor was nothing to him
The rumor must be true
I think the rumor is true
The rumor may well be true
The rumors spread soon abroad
The rumor has no foundation
Hope we can work together soon
The locust made a big jump
Keep an eye on the naughty kid
The chairs are made of wood
The pain was almost unbearable
Up jumped the three big dogs
Those two make a fine pair
The two men shook hands
The two teams fought very hard
Take off your socks
We will accept your conditions
And then he sat down himself
And my hands were shaking
And I always worried about it
And Tony was the oldest
And the tree was often alone
And the boy did
And there were three
And spent that day with Him
And so the man came in
Then you can sail away
Turn right there
Go over it again
You are in the right so far
It is no use going there
You should not go there
She advised me to go there
I intend to go there
I object to going there
You had better not go there
I went there by bus and train
He told me to go there at once
There is Tokyo
It is a town of no character
It hardly ever rains there
Nobody there knew him well
Call me up when you get there
Sign your name there
I arrived there too early
Stop going there
I made up my mind to go there
There was nobody there
There was a large crowd there
There were some flowers there
Stay put
There you are
I met a friend there
Then his mother thought
He gave it a new name
Just wait for me there
Accordingly I gave up my plans
You need to wear a tie there
I had no chance to relax there
I saw a wonderful fall there
That is where you are wrong
Get down from there
Do not be so critical
You are correct in thinking so
Few people think so
The idea made my soul rise
I suppose so
Some do think so
I am not alone in thinking so
I can not but think so
It is not too much to say so
You are very kind to say so
You are kind to say so
It is kind of you to say so
That is how she learns English
I agree
I want to go there very much
I like Renoir very much
I suppose you could say that
I scarcely think so
I hope not
Let me see
Yes and no
Yes
He swims fastest in our school
You were three months old then
I hope so
That makes for efficiency
We have no choice but to do so
It is not etiquette to do so
It was to his profit to do so
It will aggravate the wound
It is kind of you to do so
Such ability is native to him
Such a man is bound to fail
Whoever says so is a liar
That is why he got angry
That is why I came here
I have a phobia for that
It gets on my nerves
I love that combination
This chair is ugly
Jelly sets as it cools
He might at least apologize
Cicadas are singing
Do come by all means
We would love to work with you
You should have visited Kyoto
Try by all means
Do come and see us again
I will do it by all means
Try it by all means
Do it by all means
You really must see that movie
Do come and see us tomorrow
Do come and visit us
I would very much like to go
Strike the set
I shall never give up
All my pains went for nothing
All my pains were in vain
I have a chest cold
I have a cough
The Seine flows through Paris
We have safety deposit boxes
Put on your sweater
Otherwise you will catch cold
The sweater shrank in the wash
My sweater shrank in the wash
Seiko has no sisters
Then you will be happy
Jesus replied
Beware of pickpockets
Please put on your slippers
Smog causes plants to die
Smog hung over Tokyo
Please answer the phone
Excuse me
I have a favor to ask you
Excuse me
Excuse me
I have another appointment
Excuse me
Sorry
Excuse me

A Mr Smith came to see you
A sponge absorbs water
A sponge absorbs liquids
Your pants reach the floor
I have no leisure for sport
I like sport
Sport is frankly mimic warfare
Sports nurture friendships
I do not do sports
Sports keep us in good shape
I love music as well as sports
I love sports
I get that from my father

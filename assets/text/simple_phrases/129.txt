I was hoping Tom would be next
I think not
I hope Tom is doing well
We do hope that happens
I just sleep at night
Try to describe it
Try to describe him
My dad likes to get up early
I weighed the fruit
I was bitten by a spider
Yanni hid in the garden shed
They slept on the train
I sat in front
Yanni eats fries every day
This is all a big mix up
Yanni died of overwork
I heard Tom speaks French
French is a Romance language
His life was short
This is my friend Rachel
I have a pen with me
Tom went to see a lawyer
Tom and Mary are still babies
His dogs are barking
Our house got broken into
Tom led me on
I guess Tom speaks French
Your mileage may vary
We hope to do this forever
Tom told his sons to sit down
I was hoping to run into you
I messaged Tom in French
This is all a big mix up
That gives us some hope
The wind changed direction
The better team won
The better side won
Nothing else springs to mind
We support our team
Kitchenware is in the basement
Let me know if you work it out
Take your time
Take your time
Take your time
We are all just people

She has returned from Madrid
She returned from Madrid

We hope things will change

We were hoping for better news
Please take me away from here
Tom can communicate in French
Yanni had such big eyes
Yanni can see your face now
Yanni loves his mother
Yanni went there to fetch Rima
Yanni should stop talking
Yanni likes staying alone
Yanni is ready to go
Yanni should rest now
Yanni got dressed
Yanni should get dressed
Yanni will come back here

Those hopes have been dashed
Kabyles are Algerian
Tom changed his number
I saw Tom scolding Mary
Tom went missing in Australia
Tom often scratches his back
You sit with Tom
Tom fell from the third floor

We never lost hope
It seems too much to hope for
Tom cared about Mary
Tom had to repeat it
This is an onion
I hope this time it works
Tom got tased
Tom eats lunch with Mary
Tom punished Mary
It rained and rained
That was part of the plan
Tom is deeply traumatized
I know a good carpenter
Tom owns a farm in Australia
Tom finally solved the problem
We tried to foresee everything
I need more speaking practice
It was just ineffective
Hold that pose
Tom messaged me in French
Each to his own
You should sit up straight
He learned it from his parents
It was here earlier
The wind is variable
We counted them all
Tom has counted them all
Tom counted them all
The past is never coming back
The past will never return
Tom made a bad impression
Tom rang while you were away
Tom rang during your absence
Tom phoned while you were away
Tom phoned during your absence
The cafeteria was very busy
He has lunch at a cafeteria
Tom did what Mary asked
Tom had lunch at the cafeteria
The sun feels warm on my back
No one stopped to ask
No one cared to ask
They were here earlier
Tom told us how he met Mary
Hold it right there

That is the way it works

Tom loved studying French
I have to go to sleep
I will be back soon
This is never going to end
That was an evil bunny
I was in the mountains
You are in my way
I miss you
You should sleep
I never liked biology
It is unfortunately true
Hurry up
It depends on the context
This is what I would have said
One can always find time
I am not an artist
I never had the knack for it
Innocence is a beautiful thing
That is intriguing
This is not important
You can do it
I wish I could go to Japan
I have to go to bed
It may freeze next week
Thanks for your explanation
No one will know
It seems interesting to me
I like candlelight
I can only wait
I love you
I am curious
I hate chemistry
I am not much of a traveller
I have nothing better to do
Therein lies the problem
Everyone wants to meet you
Foreign people intrigue me
Bearing can be unbearable
This is a pun
Nobody understands me
I learned to live without her
Allen is a poet
The archer killed the deer
The Germans are very crafty
And they were new
People from Madrid are weird
They were left speechless
Pull into shape after washing
Wash before first wearing
They say love is blind
That is rather unexpected
Thank you
Do whatever he tells you
It is already eleven
I have a bone to pick with you
I have a dream
This is my friend Rachel
But the universe is infinite
The world is a den of crazies
You look stupid
My name is Jack
I like it very much
I have to go shopping
The telephone is too high
I have lost my wallet
Love is never wasted
Go get it yourself
I really need to hit somebody
I hate those spiders
It is very hot today
Nobody came
I never saw a red fridge
This is not my type
I was trying to kill time
I have a headache
I must admit that I snore
My shoes are too small
I need new ones
The cops are coming
You should have listened to me
He would be glad to hear that
Computers make people stupid
Ask what they do
Passion creates suffering
He plays the piano very well
I see it rarely
The car crashed into the wall
There are no real visions
The wind calmed down
Silence gives consent
I made my decision
I give you my word
We have a Pope
Take a book and read it
You make me dream
The vacation is over now
Evening dress is desired
You made me lose my mind
Life is beautiful
I love lasagna
I got struck by lightning
It is raining
Justice is expensive
Too late
I went to the zoo yesterday
We won the battle
I make lunch every day
I watched TV this morning
I read a book while eating
Your glasses fell on the floor
We went to London last year
I lost my inspiration
Be patient please
It takes time
Close the door when you leave
This is such a sad story
I like my job very much
I dreamt about you
I have to get a new computer
I was late to school
Give me a tissue
You had plenty of time
You can finish your essay now
Never try to die
I am too old for this world
Life begins when you pay taxes
It is never too late to learn
I never said I was fragile
I want a piece of candy
I knew that today would be fun
I have class tomorrow
Winter is my favorite season
I learned a lot from you
We walked a lot
She got sick this weekend
I want a massage
I need to relax
You have to rest
He disappeared without a trace
The world is full of fools
My life is hollow without him
She was wearing a black hat
We made pancakes for breakfast
I want to be more independent
Each person is a world
I feel that I am free
Freedom is not free
My brother is very important
At least he thinks he is
He will make you eat dirt
Good night
Sweet dreams
Goodbyes are always sad
Time has passed very fast
The tap is running
I am four months pregnant
Every effort deserves a reward
It costs an arm and a leg
I need your advice
That sounds interesting
Take good care of yourself
I have nowhere to go
We can travel through time
Hope is not a strategy
He laughs best who laughs last
I love trips
He died at a very old age
I liked this film
Look carefully
Better late than never
All cats are grey in the dark
Teach me how you do it
No news is good news
Wait in the waiting room
Do as you want
There was not a bloody soul
We are cut from the same cloth
The walls have ears
Make yourself at home
He came several times
We wonder why
We must think about friends
We left by train
I knew he would accept
I thought it was true
This is the boy I think about
He jumped out the window
Yesterday we had fun
They quarreled
I ate caviar
You took the wrong key
I managed to get in
Here is your change
We have to expect the worst
I talked to friends
This girl changed her look
You changed a lot
Those who know him like him
Tell me what happened
They are sensible girls
You must work more
Her garden is a work of art
Forget it
And it is useless
You need not telephone me
You are as tall as I am
She has as many books as I
Go and speak to my colleague
Maria has long hair
I have to take medicine
Please do not take photos here
My hobby is to listen to music
I work even on Sunday
It happened a long time ago
Turn right at the crossroad
They forgot to lock the door
I have to write a letter
She is mad at me
Her eyes were shining with joy
You are to come with me
You have to come with me
You have no sense of direction
You must practice grammar
You must keep your room clean
You are wavering
Have you ever climbed Mt
You are not at all wrong
You are idle to the bone
You look tired
You can rely on him
You can rely on her
You are treading on her corns
Just a minute
You were taken in by her
You must give him up for dead
You are selling him short
You must allow for his youth
You must pay attention to him
You overestimate him
You can depend on his help
You cannot expect much of him
You should tell him the truth
You ought to thank him
You will do well to leave him
You should get your hair cut
You must be a fool
You should work hard
You must study hard
You must not come in
You work too hard
You are working too hard
Take it easy for a while
You may as well leave at once
You must go home at once
You must be a late riser
You must have stayed up late
You ought to be ashamed
You must build up your courage
Your reading is very advanced
You look very pale
You look bored
You depend too much on others
You have foul breath
You are too sensitive to noise
You look as healthy as ever
You never listen
You are a good student
You ran a red light
You should swear on the Bible
You must cultivate your mind
You are made to be a poet
You seem an honest man
You seem to be an honest man
I should think you are right
You can get ahead in the world
He is ignorant of the world
You were kind to help me
You can rely on him
He never lets you down
You must clear the table
You are way off the track
You work hard
You are free to go out
You have a way with women
You should give up drinking
He looks young
He cannot be older than I
You are young
You should pay back your debts
You should pay your debts
You should get your car fixed
You had better not drive a car
You should apologize
You are free to go home
You should try to cut your way
You must perform your duty
You yourself have to finish it
You must do it yourself
You must control yourself
You write a very good hand
You must face the facts
You ought to see a dentist
You may laugh at me
You do me wrong
You may use my new car
You must do as I tell you
You are to do as I tell you
You have no claim on me
You had better do as I suggest
You were late for work
Your hair wants cutting
You are guilty of murder
You should carry out his offer
You must do your best
You work too hard these days
You had better not see her now
You look happy today
You look pale today
You must not go out today
You look very charming today
You worked a lot this week
You had better go
It is necessary for you to go
You may go or stay at will
You have to go
You made a wise choice
You did an excellent job
You must judge for yourself
You can get a loan from a bank
You have no need to hurry
You need not have hurried
You are in need of a holiday
You must go up the hill
You must form regular habits
You broke the rule
Clear up your desk a bit
You look pale
You look pale
You are as white as a sheet
You are nothing but a student
You may be late for school
You like fruit
You will stay at home
You may go anywhere
You will have your own way
You are not a coward
You dropped your pencil
The plane is on time
You are tallest
You must not tell a lie
You have only to study hard
You are in a safe place
You must make up for the loss
You have a good sense of humor
You are no longer a mere child
You are apt to be forgetful
You should act more calmly
You must study more
You should have known better
You should know better
You should study harder
You must study much harder
You should be more careful
You need to study harder
You should have worked harder
You should have come earlier
You are now an adult
You must go to bed now
You had better go to bed now
You must be less impatient
You are not a child any more
You may go home now
It is time you went to school
You surprised everybody
You failed to wake Harry up
You have to go to the party
You can always count on Tom
You are very brave
You look very tired
You may go anywhere you like
You have been imposed upon
You smoke far too much
You should cut back
You should give up smoking
You must give up smoking
All you have to do is to wait
You are to start at once
You have many books
You are not to do that
You can bank on that
You could have done it
It cannot be helped now
You must do it at once
You may keep the book
You should apply for that post
You make too much of the event
You should emphasize that fact
You must look after the child
You owe me an apology for that
You look smart in the shirt
You may go there
You may as well say so
You should have done so
You may go at once
You had better start at once
You may as well begin at once
You are to do it at once
You ought to do it at once
You must read this book also
You are not to leave this room
You can use this car
You are suitable for the job
You have only to come here
You have only to sit here
You had far better stay here
You are to stay here
You can study here
You must be mentally exhausted
You will catch cold
You have done very well
You are now among the elite
You are always complaining
You are always watching TV
You are quite a man
You are naughty
You have some books
You are a good boy
You are right in a way
You cannot buy that judge
You must stick to your promise
You have to leave home at six
You must be here till five
You need to have breakfast
Please go on with your story
I can hardly hear you
Your summary is not up to par
Your prophecy has come true
I admire you for your courage
I admire your courage
I admire your brave deed
I rest on your promise
Your eyes are red with crying
Write your name in capitals
I know your name
I admire your ignorance
You have a regular pulse
Your book is on the desk
I will be your guarantor
I am sick of your complaint
Your room is out of order
You have been beaten
Your hair is too long
Your remarks are off the point
Tell me about your daily life
Check your answers with his
Check your answer with his
Your answer is to the point
Try again
Your answer is right
Your answer is wrong
I think your answer is correct
Your efforts will soon pay off
I forget your phone number
I forget your telephone number
Your proposal is a bit extreme
I am in favor of your proposal
Bring your brother with you
Your birthday is drawing near
Your son has come of age
I cannot accept your gift
Go back to your seat
Your voice carries well
Your policy is mistaken
Your success excites my envy
Your loving friend
I like the way you smile
I expect your help
He is equal to the task
Write your address here
Your letter made me happy
Please lend me your car
Your car makes too much noise
You should have it looked at
Give me a lift in your car
I would like your picture
Your questions were too direct
Your bike is better than mine
Your watch is ten minutes slow
Just follow your heart
I think your work is all right
Your work is below average
Your work has greatly improved
Your conduct is beyond bearing
I am ashamed of your conduct
I cannot support your conduct
Please sum up your idea
Express your idea clearly
Your guess is almost right
Your view is too optimistic
I envy you your luck
Choose your favorite racket
Do as you like
You may act however you wish
Make your choice
I am amazed at your audacity
I know what you mean
You are not consistent
You may be right
What you say is right
I find it difficult to believe
You are off the point
What you say is usually true
Your study will bear fruit
I envy your good health
I will go along with your plan
Your plan is of no earthly use
Your plan is bound to fail
I approve of your plan
Tell me about your plan
Your shoes are here
Your shoes are here
I forbid you to smoke
Leave your desk as it is
Your eyes remind me of stars
That is no business of yours
Your house needs repairing
Make a sketch of your house
Your pencils need sharpening
I count on your help
Your English is improving
Your English is perfect
I want your opinion
Your opinion is off the mark
Your time is up
Look about you
I blush for your mistake
You have the advantage of me
Your pen is better than mine
Your plan sounds great
Your tie has come undone
Your dress is very nice
I will do all I can for you
I will do anything for you
Your joke bears repeating
You went too far in your joke
Your shirt is torn
We are worried about you
I have absolute trust in you
Your cake is delicious
Your collar has a stain on it
Here is your bag
I have no idea what you mean
I believe you
Your idea cannot be brand new
I regret that I told you
I have something to tell you
I have some good news for you
I will find you a good doctor
I want you to read this book
I will tell you a secret
I feel for you
You are wanted on the phone
You shall have a nice present
I will never forget seeing you
I ordered you to get out
I want you to go
I wanted to show it to you
I was chagrined at missing you
You ought to have seen it
I want you to work harder
I want to see you again
You have a bright future
You have no cause for anger
You shall want for nothing
I take my hat off to you
Life lies in front of you
You have many caring friends
I expect you to be punctual
You have a gift for music
You make me feel so guilty
I expect you to work harder
You are hopeless
You have a good friend in me
I bear no grudge against you
I expect you know all about it
You have no business doing it
You deserve the prize
You have no right to say so
I blush for you
Green suits you
I am disgusted with you
All you can do is to wait
You should have seen it
We want you to sing the song
You shall have a reward
Let me give you some advice
I owe you ten dollars
A thousand yen is owed to you
Do your work in your own way
Go for it
You deserve to succeed
You and I are good friends
You and I are the same age
I as well as you am to blame
I share your idea
I feel relaxed with you
You really are hopeless
You are young boys
You may swim now
You must conform to the rules
All of you did good work
All of you are diligent
You must start at once
You should know what to read
I wonder which of you will win
Any of you can do it
All you have to do is wait
We are both to blame
Only you answered the question
Only you can carry the bag
What a memory you have
I want you
You or I will be chosen
Either you or I am wrong
I noticed you entering my room
I need you
Either you or he is wrong
Either you are right or he is
Show me what you bought
I saw you with a tall boy
Your advice led me to success
I guess you are right
Do what you think is right
Tell me when you will call me
You may or may not win
He came after you left
You may as well go yourself
You talk next and you be quiet
I wish you could come with us
This is all you have to do now
Your meaning is beyond me
What you said surprised me
I know you are rich
It matters little what you do
I do not mind what you do
I wish you were close to me
You are to blame
You go first
I heard it from you
No harm will come to you
I can imagine how you felt
It is absurd of you to do that
Since you say so
I miss you badly
How I miss you
I miss you very much
We all miss you very much
We will miss you badly
I cannot endure your going
Here is a letter for you
Have you ever seen Mt
You can do this with ease
You come here
A bear can climb a tree
There is a hole in your sock
Put on your shoes
Please put on your shoes
Put on your shoes
Take off your shoes
Please take off your shoes
I bought a pair of shoes
Give my shoes a good shine
The shoelace came untied
Your shoes need brushing
They are muddy
Shoes are sold in pairs
You must keep your shoes clean
Tie your shoelaces
The soles of my shoes are worn
My shoes hurt
My shoes are worn out
The shoes are worn out
These shoes are too tight
They hurt
I met her by accident
I just came up with the word
I found the book by accident
I met her by chance
The sky promises fair weather
The sky looks angry
I felt hungry
Hunger is the best sauce
Hunger drove him to steal
He has a hungry look
I must make up for lost time
Fill in the blanks
You are hearing things
I went to the airport by taxi
The airport is close at hand
We saw her off at the airport
Air is invisible
Air is a mixture of gases
The air is a medium for sound
Air is indispensable to life
We cannot live without air
The air became warm
We would die without air
Look up to the skies
The sky was as clear as ever
The sky is becoming cloudy
The sky is blue
The sky was bright and clear
The sky is full of stars
The sky is over our heads
The sky grew darker and darker
The sky is covered with clouds
The sky clouded over
The sky was completely dark
The sky misted over
The sky will soon clear up
I want a few empty glasses
The sun is shining in the sky
The sky was full of stars
Birds were singing in the sky
The sky has brightened
The sky has become clear
The sky has become overcast
The sky is getting dark
The sky brightened
Stop grumbling
I want specific information
No gains without pains
No gain without pains
Prolong the agony
His face is distorted by pain
No sweet without sweat
I escaped death
Open your book to page nine
The bank is three blocks away
Please go to the bank
He works for a bank
Friday is when I am least busy
The bank shuts late on Fridays
A dance will be held on Friday
We ran short of money
Kanazawa is a quiet city
Metal contracts when cooled
The acid burned the metal
Money is the measure of worth
Money is the root of all evil
My financial worries are past
Give me your money
The rich are not always happy
The rich are often misers
He became rich
I wish I were rich
I put money in a safe
Lock the safe
There is a gold coin
I should have taken the money
Get out your wallet
Making money is his religion
Health is better than wealth
He was truly at loose ends
Money does not grow on trees
Money will make the pot boil
Money comes and goes
Gold is heavier than iron
Money ruins many
Gold is far heavier than water
I have little money
I have a little money
Ready money will away
Gold is heavier than silver
Keep the money in a safe place
Money is welcome everywhere
There is a lot of money
I have some money with me
I feel the want of money
I have no money on me
We had a bar of gold stolen
I am short of money
Money is no object
Money soon goes
Money cannot buy happiness
Money cannot buy freedom
Gold will not buy everything
He is rolling in riches
Money talks
Money is not everything
Some of the money was stolen
Take a short cut
A fire broke out near my house
I have seen much of him lately
Beef is expensive nowadays
Travelling is easy these days
Few people visit me these days
Business is so slow these days
I hope to see you soon
Prices are high these days
Take Jennifer for example
Close things look blurred
There is a hospital nearby
Sit near at hand
There is a flower shop near by
There is a bus stop near by
A fire broke out nearby
Baskets are being made nearby
I hope to see his picture soon
Report to the emergency room
I need to make an urgent call
My muscles have got soft
I advise you to stop smoking
Thank you for not smoking
Smoking on duty is not allowed
Diligence led him to success
Turn on your back
I was too astonished to speak
I was too surprised to speak
I start in surprise
A mirror reflects light
Thank you for your interest
I have heartburn
It was a heartbreaking story
I feel like vomiting
I had an angina attack
Enter by the narrow gate
Tom started the engine
The bridge is being repainted
The bridge is made of stone
The bridge is being repaired
The bridge is open to traffic

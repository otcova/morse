They are all good men at heart
They all boosted the candidate
They were all great men
They are all dead
They are people of a kind
They all laughed at his jokes
They all respect him
They live near the school
They set up a school
Learning runs in their blood

They live close by the airport
They filled in the blanks
They feel hungry
They left for Europe by air
They go without shoes
They must be waiting for you
They found Tom in the crowd
They escaped from prison
They fought a fierce battle
They will never agree
They never tell a lie
They should never play foul
They are far from happy
They intended to drill for oil
They are boring a hole
They are unlikely to marry
They decided to marry
They advanced the wedding date
They are related by blood
They are cousins by blood

They are loyal to their master
They have tea at five
They admire each other
They are of kin to each other

They entered into conversation
They study in the afternoon
They caught up with us later
They must have made a mistake
They drove the car by turns
They kept guard by turns
They are running in the park
They stood face to face
They missed a good chance
They watched their chance
They labored in the factories
They seem happy
They are happy
They lived a happy life
They must be happy
They are after happiness
They are immune to attack
They went on a voyage

He was a poet and diplomat
They failed in the examination
They are short of funds
They have something in common
They rent the car by the hour
They visited me occasionally
They started one after another
They fell one after another
They arrived one after another
They came in one after another
They named their dog Lucky
They looked up to their leader
They boast of their bridge
They fought for their liberty
They were plainly dressed
They were lying on the grass
They got out of the car
They went to Chicago by car
They have to repair their car
They live in a rented house
They went hand in hand
They kept on feeling their way
They had a good hunt
They meet once a week
They are paid by the week
They had no house to live in
They have no house to live in

Fuji last week
They are teachers
They waited for their teacher
They live across the river
They advanced to the river
They rowed up the river
They swam across the river
They lost the battle
They died in battle
They sailed around the world
They are likely to get seasick
They crept forward
All of them are not present
They are not at all interested
They were not brave at all
They are five in all
They defended their country
They agreed to start early
They arrived too soon
They despaired of their son
They named their son John
They renounced their son
They have lost a lot

They were tired of waiting
They are lazy
They have a large house
They gained great wealth

They howled with laughter
They live in a great house
They eat a lot of rice
None of them are happy
They wear their hair bobbed
They got a warm reception

They took the subway
I think that they will be late
They fixed up a quarrel
They work only during the day
They ate sandwiches for lunch
They are at lunch
They worked hard day and night
They worked around the clock
They advanced on the town
They are amid the city noises

They were never to meet again
They are paid by the day
They live in a sunny house
Fuji
Fuji
They settled in Japan
They became citizens of Japan
They go to church on Sunday
They are kind to old people
They sat according to age

They escaped being punished
They heard him come downstairs
They insist that he should go

They made her go
They admire her deeply
They have treated her well
They welcomed her warmly
They let her marry him
They must have been tired
They were very confused
They were very excited
They live in poverty
They passed an uneasy night
They do nothing but complain
They became man and wife
Fuji
They asked after my father
They sang on the stage in turn
They found the room empty
They lived in peace
They are eager for peace
They sat side by side
They made a breach in the wall
They each paid separately
They live apart
They were on duty by turns
They were taken prisoner
They dug a grave
They are well off
They were busy
They figured there was no hope
They are as strong as us
They laughed at my idea
They appreciate my effort
They are very alike to me
They might tell us the truth
They go to church every Sunday
They worship every Sunday
They need daily care
They go camping every summer
They intend to marry tomorrow
They are gathering nuts
They sat under a tree
They attained their purpose
They attained their aim
They went on talking all night
They arrived there before dawn
They are baseball players
They will keep their promise
They operated an oil well
They faced the danger bravely
They remained friends
They labored day after day
They feared being overheard
They bundled off in anger
They swam against the stream
They drifted down the river
They are picked soldiers
They attended worship
They got into the train
They sued for peace
They can think and speak
They stopped to talk
They came walking arm in arm
I bought them each a present
They may yet be happy
It is our duty to help them
Let them come in
They love each other
They died one after another
They are very compatible
You should not make fun of him
He shall be scolded
Please let him come at once
He shall go at once
Dismiss him from that post
Have him wait a moment
I caught a glimpse of him
I must help him
We cannot praise him too much
I feel guilty about it
Watch him and do likewise
Keep a close eye on him
I saw him off at the airport
Look at him
Able was I ere I saw him
Keep watch on him
I inquired after him
Follow his example
He shall be fired
I feel kind of sorry for him
It makes him a laughingstock
You ought not to believe him
You should not trust him
I convinced him of his fault
We have no trust in him
All we can do is wait for him
All who knew him admired him
Show him in
Bring him in
Give him time
I called him to the telephone
Try not to make him angry
You must not shout at him
You can rely upon him
I am far from blaming him
You take him to the hospital
I doubt if he is a lawyer
They buried him in his grave
Nobody ever praises him
It is up to you to support him
All but for he are here
He himself said so
He himself went there
He himself did it
She seems down lately
She gets lost really easily
She is leading by two meters
She cannot be over thirty
I took her for an American
She gave me some good advice
I miss her so much
She cannot have told a lie
She may well feel unhappy
I heard that she came here
I saw her coming up the road
Never was she so frightened
She cannot be here so early
She may well say so
She came out of there
That she was there is certain
She reported the news
She looked after the child
She bought a book at the shop
She cannot have done it
She cannot have said that
I know where she is
Tell me where she lives
I wonder why she is so worried
I saw her play the piano
She was ready to jump ship
I have seldom heard from her
She sent you her best wishes
She broke into tears
She acted as a guide
It was not clear what she said
Ask her what she has done
Ask her what she bought
I found out where she was
I heard her singing
She is anything but a singer
She took part in our project
She gave an address of welcome
I feel sorry for her
Her tears perplexed him
Tell me why she is crying
She was heard to cry
We heard her cry
I was not aware of her absence
The box she found was empty
What she says may be true
I just love her to death
I wish she were alive now
To my amazement she came first
I tasted the cake she cooked
I wish she had come last night
She is certain to turn up
She has been dead five years
French is taught us by her
She gave me this compact disc
She smiled at me
I had her sweep my room
She hindered me in my study
She may be our teacher
She is no match for me
She came to my aid
She was heard to cry for help
She is apt to win the prize
She can only trust him
She is by no means honest
Who she is I have no idea
She may well get angry
He arrived the day she left
They broke up
She is his present wife
She may well speak ill of him
That she is ill is obvious
She cannot have been ill
She has been sick for a week
Well may she admire her father
I saw her leaving the room
She came into the room
She gave me a present
She got me by the hand
She drives me mad
I know she is sleeping
May she return home safely
He predicted she would win
I heard her come here
I will wait until she comes
She is first in line
She just blew it off
She saw red at that moment
Her speech was excellent
They envy you your beauty
They have left school now
They sang in chorus
She gave us lots to eat
She opened the door
I generally agree with her
I enjoyed talking with her
I began a meeting with her
She and I usually agree
I hit it off well with her
I hit it off badly with her
She is amusing to be with
It is no use arguing with her
I bump into her
I will be able to marry her
She and I get on well
I exchanged seats with her
I am friendly with her
I made up with her
She deserves to succeed
I owe ten dollars to her
I have seen her three times
I saw her only a week ago
She shall serve tea
I motioned to her not to smoke
I know nothing about her
She values health above wealth
She froze me in her stare
She is proof against flattery
She has great charm
She is equal to the occasion
The story came home to her
She has a talent for dance
She kissed me full on the lips
She badly needed the money
I was much annoyed with her
She has a son everybody loves
She has a lot of work to do
She is dead to pity
She has a son who is a doctor
She has a brilliant future
She has no sense of duty
She has no brothers
She has a lot of faults
She has five older brothers
She had no idea what I said
She is nothing of a poet
She has no money about her
She has a comfortable income
She had at least four faults
She is lacking in common sense
She is free from care
She is carefree
She has very few close friends
She has a few pen pals
She has inherent dignity
She has many faults
She has a decayed tooth
I feel morally indebted to her
She has a daughter who is tall
She is dogged by misfortune
She has a subtle charm
She has some literary talent
She has a few friends
She has a gift for prophecy
She had no one to turn to
She has no one to turn to
She has no one to speak to
I plucked a daisy for her
I am dying to see her again
She has seen better days
Give my love to her
Please say hello to her
Show her how to roller skate
I am attached to her
I remember seeing her before
I wonder what happened to her
I must remember to see her
It is difficult to see her
I wish I had seen her
I had never seen her
She had no brother
Her words made me mad
I motioned her to a seat
I motioned for her to sit down
I was happy to see her again
I saw her again
I got her to wash dishes
I held the umbrella over her
She gave birth to a baby boy
You should apologize to her
You stay away from her
I wanted her to win
I challenged her for evidence
I bought her a new car
Give her a doll
I got her a doll
Tell her to come at noon
She is going to have a baby
There is no use talking to her
It is no use giving her advice
We shall never see her match
She has no one to wait on her
Let her replace it
I laid a blanket over her
Be nice to her
She was found guilty
I fell in love with her
Her excuse resulted in nothing
She is wrong
She is missing the point
Her uncle is a famous doctor
Her mother has gone shopping
Her gown was a cheap affair
Her coat is fur on the inside
You need not worry about her
Her skirt fits closely
She is a woman of great beauty
Please book a room for her
Her dress was a cheap affair
Her dress looked cheap
Her dress is not to my taste
She aims at becoming a teacher
I got a bang out of her party
Her crying is just an act
She is not playing straight
Her cheeks were red
Her cheeks were as cold as ice
Her cheeks burned with shame
Such beauty as hers is rare
You had better take her advice
Her ideas sound crazy
She is right in her opinions
Her unkind words boomeranged
Her family moved to Brazil
Her anecdotes amuse us all
Her English is excellent
I can dispense with her help
Her speech moved the audience
Her house is very modern
Her home is in the suburbs
Her house is across the river
Her family is very large
Her forehead burned with fever
Sweat bathed her brow
We had a welcome party for her
Her face became pink
Her look expressed her joy
A smile spread across her face
Her face is in focus
A smile broke out on her face
Her eyes are her best feature
She was beaming with delight
Her face went very pink
Her face was sooty
Her face beamed with joy
Her face glowed with health
She was aflame with pride
Her face turned red
Her face was ablaze with anger
Her face turned red suddenly
Her wish was realized at last
All her hopes have vanished
She hopes to become a designer
There was no changing her mind
Her scream brought the police
Her heart was full of joy
Her heart jumped for joy
Her heart was hammering
Her brother is a good driver
Her excuse added up to nothing
Whatever she says goes
I cannot trust what she says
Whatever she says is true
I doubt her words
What she says sounds strange
Her words gave me hope
Her words left him uneasy
Her grammar is bad
Her words renewed my courage
Her statement was false
Her words were as follows
Read it after her
Her thick makeup is disgusting
A smile played on her lips
She talks too aloofly
Take a seat over against her
Her ideas are quite original
Her idea counts for little
Her behavior is above praise
Her actions are to the point
Her lecture is above my head
Her talent is amazing
Her talent blossomed early
Her means are small
Her work is superior to mine
Her work is to wash the dishes
Her job is to type
He is mad about you
Her sister looks young
We received word of her death
That she is dead is certain
Her time is drawing near
Her eyes fell on the baby
I felt her eyes on my back
Her business was incorporated
Her watch is ten minutes slow
He stole her watch
Her car broke down on the way
I took a picture of her
Her car has a nice polish
Her car is two years old
Do not disturb her
She is at work right now
Her hands are never still
Her hands rested on her lap
Her hands were as cold as ice
Her hobby is collecting stamps
She has low tastes
I know her address
Her advice amounts to an order
Her wound seems to be mortal
Half her goods were sold cheap
I like the way she smiles
Her smile expressed her thanks
Her boss is hard to deal with
Her jokes made us all laugh
Her joke fell flat
Her jokes fell flat
Her occupation is teaching
Her bedroom is just above
Her mind is at peace
Her heart bounded with joy
Her heart beat fast from fear
She has a rude manner
Her new hat caught my notice
Her new hat becomes her
Her belief in God is unshaken
Her belief in God is very firm
Her kindness touched me
Her kindness was misunderstood
Imagine yourself in her place
Her doll was run over by a car
Her life is free from care
She guessed right
She has a cheerful disposition
She has an agreeable voice
Her voice was sour
Her voice carries very well
Her voice carries well
Her voice trembled with rage
She is not to blame
A great future lies before her
Her son is sure to succeed
Her son is a jet pilot
Her son called from New York
Her son is a genius
Her attitude disgusts me
Her manner was cold
She gave me a meaningful look
Her manner marks her pride
Take heed of her advice

I would like to know her name
Her life is in danger
Tears fell from her eyes
Her eyes darkened
There was fear in her eyes
Her eyes brimmed with tears
I saw tears in her eyes
Her eyes gushed with tears
Tears gathered in her eyes
Tears came to her eyes
The color of her eyes is blue
Her eyes flashed with joy
Her eyes are laughing
Her eyes were moist with tears
The sound woke her up
Her eyes remind me of a cat
Her friend is a singer
Her friends call him Ned
Her dress was very unbecoming
I meet her demands
Her cleverness often amazes me
Both her parents are dead
Her cheeks flamed up
Her arms were bound fast
I was a sucker for her tears
Her crying was just an act
Her tears were just for effect
I get her point
The way that she spoke hurt me
Her speech was full of wit
Her story excited our pity
Her story touched my heart
She speaks the truth
She often tells lies
Her story was not interesting

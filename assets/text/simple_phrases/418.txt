Something is off about this
Something is off here

We need to get cracking
All of this is mine
I know that you feel bad
His hair is not black
Tom ate snacks
I heard that you got fired
I really enjoyed your class
You were calling my name
You were knocking on the door
You were banging on the door
You were whispering
You were following us
You were staring at us
You were going to lose anyways
You were in my room
You left the kitchen light on
You were hiding in my room
You must be losing your mind
You slammed the door
You were watching YouTube
Stay close to your brother
You slammed the door open
Sleep on the couch
Clean up the mess
You snuck into my house
Stay here with the dog
Ignore it all
You think too much about her
Please answer my questions
You need to be taken care of
Get rid of this mattress
Stay with your aunt
Your bed shakes
It must be your imagination
Come over to Algeria
You could have been a victim
Go home with Ziri
You are as you always are
Think about your safety
You grabbed Ziri by the throat
You fell off of the boat
Throw Ziri over the railings

I caught you staring at Ziri
I want to watch you drown
I want to watch you die
You said that to Ziri
Take Rima to a Christmas event
The window stands wide open
The window was fully open
Get rid of all this junk
We want Tom to help us

Facebook is dead
You will not ruin our party
We need to put a stop to this
We chose him
Ziri sent Rima lewd messages
They have a better idea
We need to head home
There is mixing
Please tell me when to start
They took Tom with them

She loved Dad very much
He loved his mother very much
He loved Mom very much
It is entirely possible
Please send it to my office
There should be a comma here
I have
We have
He has
The plans have changed
The ringing woke me
There is no plan B
Please hold this candle for me
The bus came to a full stop
You look awful
You look awful
No one knows how to stop it

Now he plays the cello
Some friend you are
Now this is some news
Some expert you are
You know even less than me
Tom refused to stop
The bus came to a stop
Taxonomy is always changing
Tom was a brat
She wants to be a lesbian
Tom was a cop for a few years
You never enjoyed it
It stems from your religion
You feel inorganic
You just have to do it
You are a biological entity

This cost more than I expected
My next race is this week
They look different from you

They have
Neither of us needs to do that

I can run at full speed
Do not mess with time
We have a company
The matter was decided quickly
I want a car
Ziri has feelings for Rima
Maybe you should take a break
None of this should matter
None of that should matter
This is serious matter
This is serious matter
Think about it
It was only a matter of time
Maybe we should park here
Please put it on the table
Just put your stuff in there
You can put on your jacket now
You can put your jacket on now
All things were made by It
He wore a breastplate
I handed the map to Tom
I handed Tom the map
I got here earlier than Tom
Here is my take on the matter
I can tell
Tom stayed a little bit longer
I know that that was her duty
He sent a card to Maria
Tom is adapting
It sank
I was blinking
Mary knelt down
Mary got on her knees
We live near here
We live close by
I told him what I did
I told her what I did
He came to see me many times
The windows are wide open
I found them playing ball
I bought a shackle for the cow
My life was worthless
Tom may stay for another night
My password was compromised
I am afraid of meeting Tom
It was merely a matter of time
I never asked for anything
I will win easily
Tom stayed very quiet
He works overtime
He bought some roasted almonds
I must be going blind
Pigs grunt
There was a nail in the tyre
We always lose
All the shops are now closed
He gave me a jar of jam
I feel really short of breath
I feel chills
Knives bring Tom comfort
I lived in that house
Tom wanted to stay for a while
You can just call
Eat if you are hungry
I will eat this pear as last
Open your eyes now
Thou art but a rat in a cage
Thou art but an Earthling
I had a concussion
My spine hurts
Stop
All translation is treachery
I will not stand for slander
This is a really stupid joke
That might not matter too much
Problems soon arose
Your mobile beeped
Your phone beeped
I joined him at another table
I never learned my history
I broke up with her last night
My mom made me stay home
Close your hand
Tom wants to stay for a while
Let him say what he wants
We got that job done
Baking bread is an art
I am hoarse
I have a cold
Trust me if you want
We are what we give

It was a matter of elimination
The matter is far from settled
I moved on

This requires a special skill
Ask Mary to bring her disks
Ask Mary to bring her discs
Kurdistan has a long history
I want cuddles
The loudest he can
The loudest she can
One ring to rule them all
Merry Christmas
That was never in doubt
That was never in question
I have the queen of hearts
We never doubted it
He refuses to come
I gave Tom the map
I gave the map to Tom
Try not to get too excited
Tom was determined to try that
Try not to buy too much
Tom succeeded on his third try
Tom may try to fool you
It would be worth a try

I must be right
Say it out loud
Ziri gave Rima a side hug
Lojban is cute
Had his office in Hume street
Ziri forgot his wallet at home
Ziri brought his wallet
Tom stayed here for a few days
The hunt for Tom is ongoing
Tom stopped helping them
Cats are persistent
It is better with butter
I am toast
I am done for
I may well be wrong
I might well be wrong
She seemed cheerful
She looked cheerful
They will kill us
They will certainly kill us

Embrace the chaos

I think highly of Tom
Maybe I can make Tom read it
I did
I made up with Tom
You simply have to try this
I worry about Tom
Try to be prudent
I was able to help Tom
Life is what we make of it
I embarrassed Tom
We need to stay healthy

Mary was wearing a red scarf
We tried to persuade Tom
This is the best fit for me
Tom tried doing that again
I stopped and stared at Tom
Tom keeps up with the times
He was always into art
Tom had three
Make him get in the car
You went up the stairs
I like how you look at things
His sleepiness went away
Living on Mars would be cool
Tom is the best at this job
I have a fear of heights
He got an immediate response

The whole situation was a mess
We outstayed our welcome
We overstayed our welcome
Our water pipes broke
Tom painted a picture of Mary
We had a good crop this year
I want my old life back
Tom is a store manager
We started clapping
Please come back some day
She got nothing at all to eat
That is utterly insincere
It was not possible to escape
That is utterly indescribable
That defies all description
We were utterly dismayed
I absolutely have to share
Tom is opposed to this
I have to buy gas
I have to buy petrol
Prudence is never excessive
Tom is a really bad man
Consider the alternative
Things are under control
I work as much as possible
There is no hot water here
Tom is up in the attic
I am sad because my cat died
His parents are obese
This room suits me well
I have accumulated a fortune
You are a real groundhog
You seem lost to me
I never saw his face again

Danny is making biko
I have to show my face there
We will go there with Tom
Tom never ignored Mary
Watch the way
I bought you bicycles
Tom lives near a church
Now I make twice as much
Russia is for the sad
I got this for peanuts
Tom turned around to face us
Screw physics
GM
Mary was just looking for you
I like that you like it
Phone me tomorrow at nine
Ring me tomorrow at nine
Tom was kind of right
This house is big
Walk as fast as you can
Breathe all the way out
She has chronic bronchitis
We have enough to eat
It gets dark at half five now
Alsatians tend to be loyal
I can pick it up tomorrow
Tom is doing way better now
Get a bus
Catch a bus
I am the light of the world
My car is always conking out
My car breaks down constantly
Overtaking here is prohibited
All of them are students
Tom is going to watch a movie
I want you to take charge
Shadow Tom
Tom searched all over for Mary
My car is always breaking down
You are an adult
We divided the money equally
I have Solar System atlases
Quit joshing me
He never got married
He regrets it
He feels lonely
I used to know how to do that
I have a nonhuman soul
Come home and face the music
Tom said he needed Mary
I hate Tom because I just do
I want to make it simple
I want to protect this smile
Tom was as high as a kite
I thought Tom had the day off
Tom plays the oboe well
She writes to me every week
Tom is a sloppy kisser
Get into position
The leech is a parasite
It makes no sense to do that
It could have been a swallow
A swallow was flying above us

It is a spiritual experience
Tom is there with Mary

Tom tried to charm the ladies
I think both match

The door shut after Tom
It happened before
Both match

Tom is in his repertoire
The antelope is running away
Wild red poppies grew
The cat is watching the mouse
The sentries are on guard
The story resonated widely
The article resonated widely
She is badly brought up
Tom stopped cursing
The sentries are on guard duty
A rugby ball is oval
The object was oval in shape
An egg is not round but oval
The future of anime is shota
Chalk it up as a loss
Sorry
I made a mistake
I wear boots all the time
I think it may be defective
We barely met the deadline
Tom should go there
Tom plays an instrument
My right foot is numb
I think this may be defective
This seems to be defective
This seems to be broken
Almost everyone was bald

We need to find new jobs
The prize went to Tom
You caught the balloon
You caught the ball
This study may be flawed
Tom is eating slowly

It takes all kinds

He seems cool
Now I can relax
Tom will be busy all week
He conveyed his love to her
I promise that is what I said

Entrust him to me
Leave him to me
Ask more questions

Sit on the floor
Stop doing that immediately
Get out of bed and get dressed
Close the door and lock it
Use this one

Tell Tom to go home
Make sure no one sees you
Leave the door closed
They study
We came
You drink
Very funny
Those people tried to kill me
Learn more
Tom sometimes stops by
We swim
We drank
Maria reads
Muriel is Indian
My name is Hasaschi
The big flower is yellow
I carried the message to Tom
Tom sure has a nice job
I hope you come to our party
Mix the flour and the sugar
Please sit down and be quiet
Look under your desk
It might be there
Put on your sweater
Put your sweater on
Mix the flour with the sugar

I did see Tom
We need food and water
Water flows downhill
We had a very stormy debate
I pledged my loyalty to Tom
Tom is glad that he voted
Toss it into the rubbish
Toss it into the rubbish bin
No one respects men like Tom
Nobody go in there
No one will go in there
I can take the rest
The water came up to our knees
Get a wriggle on

He just chooses not to
You can keep the rest
Nobody gives a damn
Tom slept last night
Tom fell asleep last night
I can take care of the rest
Take it yourself
Save your wit for someone else

You can take a joke
You know how to take a joke
Everyone but me was invited
Everyone was invited except me
I feel awful
I think I need to be sick
The bus was overcrowded
I should have got a taxi
Tom always goes to work by bus
I got married last year
The water butt leaks
Nothing seems to have happened
Tom was furious
I like modern music
It was our decision
It was their decision
It was her decision
I have hardly any books
Come round any time
Pop round any time
You should be dancing
He helps me a lot
She always wears jeans
We never talked about it
Those are his books
I could walk with you guys
I always drink from the bottle
I took my temperature
Tom suddenly quit
She crosses my mind often
Memories are our fortune
She never sleeps
I spoke after Tom spoke
Toss it in the trash
Tom is going to laugh
It was on my mind all the time
I suggest we leave early
I only translate quotes I like
My dad was once a poor laborer
We were kids without dessert
Tell the kids that I love them
I was only trying to help
Tom has never ridden a bike
I have blind faith in him
I never give advice to others
He has a sweet tooth
You have no power over me
He has a weak character
Man is weak by nature
You bastard
The answer is within you
You can talk to me casually
I let him ruin my life
Listen carefully to my words
The water is boiling
He blamed it all on me
My boss made a pass at me
You were born to be a whore
He always plays the victim

He returned here
He came back here
You lot are too drunk
I was wrong on that score
Tom put some socks on
Tom is always in good spirits
Wait until six in the evening

Just out of curiosity
He died of hunger
The soap burns his eyes
I still have so much to learn
I have a thirst for knowledge
He pushed me down the stairs
All his family works on a farm
You only think of yourself
This summer is unusually hot
Move over and let me pass
Primulas are spring flowers
They often skive off school
They often bunk off school
You often skive off school
You often bunk off school
You lot often bunk off school
We often skive off school
We often bunk off school
Mum made some apple pie today
Mum baked an apple pie today
Tom was only scratched
I burned the letters
It snowed last week
We are stuck here
You take more chances than me
I do not know who he is
I do not know who she is
We got close
Health is an asset
Health is a treasure
Health is treasured
I never cook fried food
I got a stomachache
Wipe your tears
Our dog follows me everywhere
Make like a bee and buzz off
I like bears

I really did

I know
I understand
It is easier to read

As long as we have strong legs

He died alone
My phone has a dead battery
My cat is purring
Love of my life
Open the window

Better shut the door
You can sleep here tonight
I detect a slight accent
I put my jewelry in the safe
I feel so helpless
He seems like he likes kids
Tell me why you quit your job
I need a wrench
Go and take a look
Please go and take a look
It was an unpleasant sight
You need to mow the lawn
There is some dawn light
It is quiet
I sit on a bench
It is Imaginary Visualization
I like it
The future starts now
I also speak Spanish
Others just smile
Criticizing something is easy
Doing something is hard
Not really
I want to go someplace
Spanish is easy to study
I swam for three hours today
Winter break is oooooooooover
There are no more fish
Tom has a lot of cool gadgets
Everything has been canceled
Eric Zemmour is a cheap racist
They want our souls
Surrender your weapons
I should buy one of these
I should buy a new one
You should buy a new one
I should buy another one
You should buy another one
I killed those innocent people
It was shocking
Summer is still far away
I am not able to drink sake
The way you smile is wonderful
I enjoy the company of men
I got a bump on my head
We tried fishing
Good day
He greeted me with a big smile
Her nephew lives in America
These shoes are not warm
The moon sank in the night sky
She whispered in my ear
Your cold may get worse
You cannot yet get up

Neither can I see anything
We opposed it
I really like cycling
I really like biking
I really enjoy cycling
I really enjoy biking

My voice got hoarse

Ziri and I will be friends
Ziri was driving an old car
Ziri was hired as a driver
Ziri rides this bus every day
Happy New Year

Ziri is sleeping on the couch
Excuse me
Ziri can play Celtic music
Ziri wants this in his room
Ziri likes the way Rima dances
Rima has sexy eyes
I will have a beer with Tom
Ziri sees faces everywhere
Mom loves you more than me
Your joke is way out of line
I drink my coffee bitter
He got a tattoo on his arm
I have a steady job
Tom is a mass of insecurity
Tom usually gets his way
This pillow smells musty
Exports have been slowing down
We need to know by tomorrow
What Tom said may not be true
I saw Tom kicking your dog
I saw Tom kick your dog
I checked the time on my phone
Damn the day I met you
Tom used to be a drug addict
Tom was once a drug addict
Tom got along well with Mary

Tom stared at the tree
Tom is a professional skier
Tom is a professional surfer
Tom likes skiing
Tom likes snowboarding

Tom is so basic
She drank in big gulps
His hands are shaking
The final is tomorrow
You dialled the wrong number
Let me put it more clearly
The fortress will fall
Tom likes winter sports
Mary likes winter sports
The city is west of London
Mary drinks only chamomile tea
She comes from Genoa
The wind is getting up
It looks like rain
The lorry ignored a stop sign
It means the same thing
The meaning is the same
Send me a picture
I know those places well
Grab hold of the rope
This zip is stuck
There are no birds singing
The wind had died down
The night was still
The Yule Cat is full
Stop it
Get some help
Mary has a small waist
I eat flies
Tom had trouble getting up
I found it in a drawer
I peed in the bushes
My dog loses a lot of fur
Winter break is over
Tom often accepted bad advice
Tom gave a faint smile
Tom felt a little bit tired
Mary dumped me
Tom drank a cup of milk
Tom refused to go with them
I learned all of it from Tom
I was young and I needed money
The roof of my house is new
Snow can bend the roof
These trees are ancient
These trees are centuries old
A legal precedent has been set
Mary closed the door silently
My phone is on mute
He is impeccably dressed
I get sentimental
He leads an ordinary life
This version is untenable
He has a keen sense of justice
The door creaked treacherously
This is complete degradation
Tom suddenly looks so neat
In no way is he a doctor
He is a paramedic
Vacations are fun
Nothing good will come of it
I can hear perfectly
The doctor bandaged his head
He lives on the edge of town
He turned his back on me
Tom told me that he feels safe
Tom was impeccably dressed
He was of Italian descent
Tom tried to provoke a fight
Tom is always provoking fights
What Tom did was very risky
He is gay
He ran a hand over his face
This is all happening too fast
I felt a lump in my throat
Guess what Tom gave Mary
He looked relieved
I was in an awkward situation
He patted me on the back
Scarcity breeds violence
He performed oral sex on me
All I need is thirty minutes
You showed me your heart
He was a man of science
We love each other
He was tall and blond
He was a Japanese from Hawaii
He was handsome and dark
Thomas was an atheist
Just do it
That scares the hell out of me
I was unprepared for the event
I felt rage mounting inside me
A doubt has occurred to me
Everyone already knew about it
I get lost in daydreams
I needed to take a leak
He grabbed my wrist
Thank Tom
I left my mobile behind
Stop humming and hawing
Anger wells up inside me
Her pupils are dilated
I tripped on the sidewalk
He lashed out at me
I moved to the side
She had never been so lonely
No one had thought of that
No one thought of that
He had almost forgotten her
I pissed on him
He lives in another town
He lives in another city
We went together to Mexico
Tom married later than I did
I was hypnotised
Tom is coming here tomorrow
I unbuckled my seat belt
Tom is living here temporarily
I closed the door behind me
I got a tooth decay
He had a blank stare
Invite her to the theatre
Tom left his flat
Tom slipped into his jacket
It just depends on you
I was talking to myself
It could have ended tragically
He is a poet
My name is Massinissa
I appeared in court
I appeared before the tribunal
The voices are back
Tom asked Mary to the dance
My head is going to explode
Hope is breakable
Please turn off your phones
He happened to be passing by
Tom walked slowly forward
He never gets any peace
He speaks American English
You got an answer
That was the first novel I red
I felt that I should help Tom
I bought some more beer
I bought another case of beer
I should probably not be here
We both started crying
These two are simliar
The children were misbehaving
The children were noisy
Tom thanked me for saving Mary
Tom fixed the broken door
I like the way you see
I like the way you cook
I like the way you dance
My girlfriend is a Canadian
No news is bad news
Mary just gave birth
I opened the book at random
It should be a good race
We plan to finish by Monday
Mary is so beautiful
I am standing by the car
I guess now is the right time
Tom needs to come home
Tom has to get home right away
Tom took care of himself
They got arrested
I have taken enough photos
Thank you

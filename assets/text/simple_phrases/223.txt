She blew him a kiss
My wrist hurts
I apologize to all of you
I order pizza

Eat
He knew the story already
Last night I dreamt of you
Now you tell
Fun became earnest
Earnest is now four years old
He who marries changes
I come here as often as I can
I go as often as I can
She greeted me politely
Quarantine in progress
Please drive slowly
We are going home

Leave a comment
Every comment is unnecessary

I was nervous and scared
The horse is in the stable

He learned Latin in school

Only animals should wear fur

Elves are very mean
I arrived late last night
I heard him sing a song
He considered a collaboration
My father bought me this hat
I go to bed at eleven at night
I like this song
A fork is missing
He lost his sight
Drive cautiously
Make a cross before your name
Be quiet for a second
Almost there
He moves awkwardly
He died rather young
My brother just went
Javier blushed
Javier is turning red
The falcon has keen eyes
The falcon has sharp eyes
She has a keen business sense
This girl has become a woman
A banana is yellow
The sun will soon set
After pleasure comes pain
Her story was made up
Their story was made up
Steal money
I can hardly understand you
Women earn less than men
The night was long
I left the car in the garage
You will probably succeed
It was easily resolved
I think it will storm soon
I want to water ski
I really feel hurt
Starting is half the battle
Her eyes welled up with tears
He lost no time
Witnesses can lie
Wine is a poem in a bottle
Water is a source of life
It sure is cold today
Nobody waits for me
You are what you read
He speaks fluent English
He found his end
My sons have grown up
This is a girl I know well
The roads are treacherous
I swear to God
God is nature
Sympathy is a human emotion
I speak Mari
She is a prophetic figure
Tottie is a prophetic figure
She can predict the future
He can predict the future
He is a prophetic figure
He lost his balance
They are digging a hole
I was confused at first
Fear breeds bigotry
Never give up on your dreams
Beatings foster prudence
It is clearly inevitable
Tom was getting impatient
He only kissed me once
The kiss was amazing
Come fishing with me
I wanted to show him to you
Alternate
Take turns
Mix flower with two eggs
She helped me in every way
I would like to buy
I begged her not to go there
They can conquer their fear
Mary is not my girlfriend
Tom is not my boyfriend
You said it would never happen
Tom would never have done that
Tom was supposed to protect us
Tom was in here the whole time
Tom started to untie his shoes
This is an unexpected surprise
This is all a terrible mistake
Tom was unsure how to proceed
Tom was supposed to assist me
Tom said you would understand
Tom quickly opened the letter
I feel like I can do anything
I did what Tom asked me to do
You must really like dancing
Tom often stays up all night
Tom learned French in school
Tom is very unhappy with you
Tom had a terrible childhood
We have unfinished business
We have some wonderful news
Tom was unsure how to react
Tom was supposed to help me
Tom planned the whole thing
Tom looked at me and smiled
Tom knows what would happen
This was a terrible mistake
Now I know what I should do
You have a wonderful voice
Tom was unsure what to say
Tom missed the whole thing
Tom knew the story already
Tom is supposed to be here
You were supposed to wait
We have not yet succeeded
Tom wrote to me yesterday
Tom was unsure what to do
Tom goes to school by bus
We argued the whole time
Tom told me to come here
Tom speaks fluent French
Tom said Mary would call
Tom has not yet returned
You have until midnight
Tom said you would come
Tom left his bed unmade
Tom is unhappy about it
Tom greeted me politely
I begged Tom not to go
You have until Monday
Tom took a wild guess
That kiss was amazing
I wonder what that is
Tom broke the record
Tom looks very sick
I need to focus
I came here for that reason
She laughed happily
Have a nice evening
It was smaller than I thought
It was just my imagination
It was just your imagination
Someone stole my money
Open your books
I sometimes go to the cinema
I met my friends
The coin is gold
We bought the newspaper
I can help my brother
This only happened once
I have to be careful
It rained a lot last summer
I dream a lot
A question is an answer
Music is the soul of geometry
Time is the sin of eternity
Tom loved singing
Tom never boarded the plane
Tom never got on the plane
Tom lost his boarding pass
Please help conserve water
Tom cried
I had no sales today
Forgive and forget
This movie terrifies children
I was very busy today
I like the picture
Liisa had her hair dyed blonde
Famine weakens
Debt causes suffering
Tom had his hair dyed black
This coffee comes from Eritrea
She cares about your safety
We talked about this and that
Unwrap it
The tree fell to the ground
I know what may happen here
I know what might happen here
My hearing is bad
My makeup has washed off
Mary slept with a coworker
The past is the past
Your story is boring
We have to go to school
Relax
You can always contact me
You must be new around here
This subject is just terrible
I filled the jug to the brim
This is all I can teach you
Hell is paved with promises
I see a man and a woman
Evil is not eternal
To live is to struggle
He has already started
Happiness is always with you
Show me another one
I want to master Swedish
It all happened so fast
I know this feeling very well
Years are deceptive
Bulgarian is close to Russian
We speak Mari
Life will teach you everything
The truck nearly ran me over
His name is Tom
One and one makes two
It was impudent of him
No steam breaks bones
He is skilled in handicraft
He continued singing
He was giving a speech
He heard the sound
That was not my understanding
Wait a minute
Stand by for my orders
Stand by for my signal
Police arrested the kidnapper
Yesterday I came here
The storm is dangerous
He likes to sing
He likes singing
Now admit it
You know it anyway
Everything has to be paid for
I want to have lunch
Warts are ugly but harmless
Tom will always love you
The countdown has started
I think they really like Tom
I think they really like you
I think she really likes Tom
I think he really likes Tom
Please turn off your cellphone
Smile for the camera
Jesus turned water into wine
Let me open this discussion
I will find a job in China
It was nice seeing you
The day is cold
The fire is hot
It was very enjoyable
I want to invite you to dinner
We have a water outage
We have no water
I heard a strange noise
I think that went really well
Stop telling me what to do
She is lazy
His kingdom is your hell
Our cousin had twins
Fill the pot with water
One lives and learns
I usually read on the verandah
I am afraid of escalators
Lipids are organic compounds
She is quick at figures
We appreciate her talent
I sucked my finger
She has a good heart
He has a good heart
We are made to make mistakes
He came back home before eight
The thief vanished
Tom likes carving pipes
He said yes
We eat every evening at six
Everyone loves their father
Everyone loves the father
This sentence is not in Polish
I am fasting today
Tom might talk
I will be at the meeting
My room is a pigsty
Precision is important in math
There is a call for you
I live alone in this house
Just joshing
No smoking in the theater
The pen is on the desk
Time erases many memories
We heard the speech to the end
He stood all by himself
He stood by himself
There will I give thee my love
My interest is people watching
I thought it was funny
I like macadamia nuts
Mary likes helping others
Tom is a heavy tea drinker
I have never heard of Tatoeba
I need more cover
I just feel so lost
This is not fun
What Tom did was illegal
Whoever reads that is silly
This is what you wanted
This is what you have to do
I believe Tom knows
Sleep well
I hope you dream about angels
Finish what you started
Tell us what happened
Tell us what you saw
We soon sold all merchandise
He gave some milk to the cat
This steak is very juicy
I missed you for all this time
You lie like a rug
I have to take it off
Tell us what that is
I hate the laws
His nephew lives in America
Thank you with all my heart
This is how you get results
You need to teach him a lesson
We had a great time last night

I think over what went wrong
I cheated on my boyfriend
They put a spoke in his wheel
We did what we had to do
It was marvellous to meet you
Ask whatever you want
Ask whatever you want to
Ask whatever you want to ask
I was stuck
Take whatever you need
Wear whatever you want
Wear whatever you want to wear
Spend whatever you need
Give Tom whatever he wants
Let go of them
Let them go now
Believe what you want
Now go have fun
Now go to sleep
Just go to sleep
Let go of my arms
Let go of my hair
Let go of my hand
We found a corpse in the ruins
He often changes his mind
One of us has to go
Somebody has to go first
Somebody has to go for help
Nobody goes in there
Work is going well
Pack what you need
I thought it was really cute
That I cannot imagine
Tell Tom what happened

Rima is scared
Ziri told us we should go back
Ziri forgot his way back
Ziri knows the way back

Ziri was still curious
Ziri is a killjoy
Ziri should be very afraid
Ziri stopped breathing
Ziri put the Ouidja bord away
The planchette moved violently
The planchette moved fast

Ziri has hives in the backyard
Ziri almost dropped the hive
Just houses
Ziri lived in that house

Ziri glanced to his right
Ziri walked briskly to his car
Ziri walked a few more paces
Ziri got his key out
Ziri put his car in reverse
Ziri never stopped
Ziri left the parking lot

Ziri wants to get out of there
Ziri pleaded
Ziri looked down at the ground
Ziri let out a sigh of relief
Ziri went down to the cellar
Ziri can go back to the van
Ziri hurried back to the van
Ziri waited in the van
Ziri shone his light around
Ziri got a creepy feeling
Ziri has a bad Kabyle accent
Ziri dug a grave
They attack national identity
It was dead quiet
Ziri opened the cellar door
It was pitch black and quiet
They no longer have an idetity
Ziri came up the stairs
Ziri ran out of the cafeteria
This is why they fear Ziri
This is why they hate Ziri
Ziri stood in the cellar
Ziri has nothing better to do
Ziri had a bad feeling
Ziri asked Rima what was wrong
Ziri asked what was happening
Ziri knows a lot about cars
Ziri should go now
Ziri thinks Rima should go now
Ziri put the van in reverse
Ziri never said he was alone
Ziri kept driving through
Ziri said that out loud
Ziri started spewing vulgarity
Distance yourself from Ziri
You take things too personally
What you are doing is wrong
You have to know these things
That cloud looks like a rabbit
His advice was ineffective
They like to learn English
I like to be a History teacher
I like being a History teacher

I wonder if this is a dream
This must be a dream
You gotta do it
Dust is all over the desk
You gotta do what you gotta do
Protect trans kids
She took me aside
I made everything work
He crossed the street on foot
The eagle swooped on its prey
Hold the fort until I get back
Scotland shall be free
I need the toilet
My passion is music
We knew from the start
We knew it from the outset
We often play truant
It looks alive
I learned it on impulse
Ziri is laughing
Ziri drove back to the city

These dates are very juicy
Some date palm trees survived
A date palm tree fell
The garden is in disarray
The date palm tree is down
He wrote a lot of poems
Ziri is digging the holes
The hole is dug out
The water stayed in the hole
The bucket was full of compost
This soil has nutrients in it
Ziri grows date palm trees
Ziri grows his dates at home
The soil is a lot looser
We all have burdens to bear
Ziri needs to stay productive
Ziri is clumsy and inattentive
Bad news spread quickly
No human being is perfect
Her new book is amazing
Bad days do happen
Bad days are temporary
I have proof before your eyes
I write fantasy
I watch too much TV
The old tree has many branches
We protect ourselves
We protect each other
Cholera is a dangerous disease
She has caught cholera
You have a sweet dog
You use your brain to think
I am the sum of my experiences
You made my life a living hell
You made my life difficult
You attempted to take my life
You ruined my entire existence
You made my life hell
You gave new life to my world
You rushed over to me
His dick is thick
He called me the next morning
No woman is perfect
She collapsed onto the chair
My neck is extremely tense
He gave his stomach a pat
Leave trans kids alone
Give the land back
We could be at war by tomorrow
Tom admitted candidly
We cannot see anything
My wife is the prettiest
Hurts a little
They are going to be punished
The tobacco garden dog barked
Abrams wiped the table clean
The king is my brother
The second hand has stopped
The train took the wrong route
She has several hundred books
Ring me back
Phone me back
I had a curry last night
I want a chewy sweet
She dresses strangely
He drove like lightning
This map will be useful to you
No evidence was found
Next year is a leap year
This could have been an email
Tom closed the window
He is a patriotic person
All the answers were negative
We shared a childhood
He respects me enough to lie
I spent a week in Istanbul
She undressed
I apologise for last week
He makes me nervous
Hearing that gives me relief
I wish it never happened
I still care about you a lot
I eagerly await your arrival

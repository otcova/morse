Ziri has been there before us
Ziri made his way back to camp
Ziri saw a male gazelle
Ziri raised his rifle
Ziri pulled the trigger
Ziri started to cook dinner
Ziri saw a gazelle earlier
Ziri had long arms
The monster had human teeth
Ziri grabbed his gun
Ziri kept going
Ziri hid behind a large rock
Ziri waited for a minute
Nothing else ever happened
The trail is nice
The hiking trail is nice
Ziri saw something big
Ziri got jumped by something
Ziri heard human screaming
Ziri was still far away
Ziri started to hear rustling
Ziri had the same feeling
Ziri lived in the country
Ziri camped with his dad
Nothing beats that
This is a triptych
My air bed has a leak
Download it online
You were my favorite student
My hobby is drawing
Ziri shouted even louder
The gazelle followed Ziri
The traffic lights are red
The traffic lights are on red
The traffic lights are amber
Ziri knows that answer already
Tell us so we know as well
I lay there in disbelief
I invited her to see a film
The snake slithered away
Sleep took hold of Ziri
Ziri threw on his shoes
She looked at her pocket watch
Ziri is currently fourteen
Ziri was allowed to go fishing
Ziri fished for trout and bass
Ziri caught a brown trout
Ziri caught some small trout
It sounds more like a hyena
Ziri heard an angry growl
Ziri heard the sound again
Ziri met up with them
Ziri quickly left the mountain
The bird was out of sight
Ziri tried to find that bird
Ziri explored the new beach
Ziri was a seasonal worker
Ziri hiked towards the cabin
Ziri seemed to notice Rima
I had started to forget Tom
Ziri got an unwelcome feeling
We were all miserable
Ziri set up his hammock
Ziri had to keep moving
Ziri took out his hammock
Ziri slept in a hammock
That was all we had
No one was awake
Ziri drew his knife and sat up
I was bored as can be
Ziri started to feel tired
My adrenaline started pumping
The sound came from ahead
The roo was gutted alive
Neither of us ran
Ziri saw a rabbit run by
Ziri set off into the darkness
Ziri silently enjoyed the view
Ziri could see the sheep
Ziri arrived at the pen
The creature stepped closer
This could be the death of me
The hyena came closer
Ziri was attacked by a hyena
Ziri stepped backward slightly
Ziri used to play that game
The hyena sniffed Ziri
Ziri moved into a camper van
Ziri headed north to Algiers
Ziri headed to Algiers
Ziri was in a small forest
Ziri retired early to his RV
There were wild cattle around
We sang a duet
The nail is bent
Ziri began to notice the light
The light was soothing
The light changed colors often
I lost my breath at that point
Ziri was peeking at Rima
Ziri ran back to the van
This was a relief
The lights were very far away
A bright light came on
The machine was large
The UFO was clearly visible
People here are agreeable
Naama is a dry place
Both Ziri and Rima aged
A storm is about to happen
Ziri was running out of time
Ziri said that with a sigh
Ziri spoke again
Ziri read the signs
Ziri soon relaxed
The tent lamp powered off
We fell on top of each other
Ziri felt himself plummeting
Ziri was delusional
Ziri has never been so angry
Ziri nearly died that night
Ziri went camping in Algeria
A storm was beginning to brew
The morning was clear and cool
Ziri loves the sunrise
Ziri needed the break
Ziri seemed concerned
That uneasy feeling came back
A tree has fallen over
Ziri picked up the pace
Ziri thought it was over
What Ziri told Rima scared her
The jackals never killed cows
Ziri jumped to the other side
Ziri crossed that bridge
Ziri was creeped out
Ziri could see the treeline
Ziri started back at the woods
The elephant broke our fence
Ziri was granted the land
The police canvassed the area
Ziri was still closeby
Ziri immediately freaked out
I have to sneeze
They thanked Tom and left
But the peasant smiled at him
I feel numb
Thanks for being there for me
Tom is all by his lonesome
Today is a bad day
Juan is sad
We were treated very kindly
Tom was standing by a window
Tom is too sick to see you
We ought to help Tom do that
Stealing is bad
Money created the world
She changes her mind easily
I think that would be more fun
There is a hyena in the area
All my friends were awake
The hyena was staring at Ziri
Ziri felt pretty foolish
The hyena will attack
The hyena ran away
It sounded like bones breaking
The fire sprung to life
Sparks were flying off
Ziri started a forest fire
Ziri hopped in his truck
Ziri left a trout in his tent
He just saw its eyes
Hyenas are territorial beasts
Ziri had to move for work
Ziri never wanted kids
Ziri had a few cats
Ziri unpacked at his new place
Ziri spent the night packing
Ziri went hiking with a friend
Ziri arrived well before noon
Ziri checked everything again
Ziri read the display board
A hyena roamed the area
Ziri read the map correctly
Have a good hike
Ziri made it to the clearing
Ziri paused for a bit
It was a piece of cake
Ziri arrived at the peak
Ziri started his descent
Ziri faced worse
The trail was on the left
Ziri paid no mind to it
The hyena ran and it ran fast
There is no reason for it
Ziri checked for his gun
Ziri stepped into the clearing
Ziri walked into a dark room
Ziri was freezing
Ziri was freezing in the snow
The snow was gone
Ziri made his way closer
The door to the cabin was open
Ziri saw a bird on the fence
There was a sign on the fence
Ziri learned to obey the rules
Rules are made to be obeyed
Rules are made to be followed
Ziri read the warning signs
Ziri sent a message back
Ziri needed some shelter
Ziri began to climb the fence
Smoke was still puffing away
Ziri was on the snow
Ziri just remained still
Ziri walked toward the cabin
Ziri began to breathe rapidly
Ziri has got a gun on him
The silhouette remained still
Ziri stood still for a minute
Ziri drew his gun
Ziri slowly sidestepped
Ziri neared the door
Ziri landed on his back
Ziri glanced at the window
The hyena was perfectly still
There was a door to the left
Ziri ignored the radio
Ziri will beat Rima
Static came out from the phone
Ziri is going to leave
Ziri ran to the back door
Ziri pulled his gun
There were no screams
Ziri cannot let Rima out
Ziri reached for his phone
Ziri checked his phone again
Something was wrong with me
The creature had no eyes
The creatures reached for me
Ziri was terrified to be alone
Ziri did that on his own
Ziri heard the words
Ziri was staring at the radio
The radio stopped
Ziri was inside the bathroom
Ziri shut the door and waited
There were twelve
Ziri scooped the cat up
Ziri heard another whisper
Ziri scanned the room quickly
Ziri needed to focus
Nothing attacked Ziri
Ziri darted for the door
Ziri dove into the snow
Ziri struggled to wriggle free
Ziri sped his way to the fence
The cat clung to Ziri
The crowd rushed to the fence
Ziri reached for his gun
Four days had passed
Ziri rationed his food
Ziri is safe and home
A hiker went missing
Ziri began to make some tea
Ziri found a cabin
Ziri sounded insane
The hyena was badly injured
Ziri got injured by a poacher
Ziri chased the poacher
Ziri shot at the gazelle
What Ziri did was very illegal
Ziri confirmed the call
The area was covered in trees
Ziri found a wounded gazelle
The flesh stinks
Ziri called a game warden
Ziri radioed the game warden
The smell is much stronger now
Ziri passed between the trees
The bear was very large
Ziri had a foggy white eye
This disease affects gazelles
This disease is very nasty
This gazelle is very dead
Ziri saved me
Nothing like that is real
Ziri saw a yeti on YouTube
Ziri told his story
Ziri stood behind Rima
Ziri began his story
Ziri had a nice trailer
Ziri was hunting elk
Ziri walked for an hour
The hyena was stinky
Ziri saw that hyena
The bush grew thicker
The forest has gone silent
Ziri told Rima to come here
Ziri smelt rotting flesh
Ziri smelt urine
Ziri stepped out of a thicket
Ziri heard the shots
The creature was distracted
Ziri encountered a yeti
Ziri had waters in his ears
Ziri explained what he saw
Ziri found signs of a struggle
Ziri said that aloud
Ziri gathered his things
Ziri had to see
Ziri had to know
Bigfoot is real
Ziri knows that Bigfoot exists
We go up the tower
He was sent to the front lines
The bad people are in prison
Tom opened a bag
Tom opened the sack
Tom opened a sack
I go get my bag
Tom assessed the damages
Tom did his work well
Many people left before noon
Tom lived here three years
That umbrella is mine
Tom wanted to buy some fruit
Tom lives at home
This is the book that I found
Tom ran a race yesterday
Tom said hi to the cashier
Then so be it
He phoned me at midnight
She phoned me at midnight
She rang me at midnight
This gentleman is paying
No
Of course
The future looks bleak
Tom most likely forgot
Tom most probably forgot
You look tired
I have to go out now
Ziri is ruining my life
The whole place was dead
The forest is silent
Plastic was everywhere
Ziri sat on a log
Ziri was out there
Ziri trashed the place
The forest went quiet again
Ziri fired off four bullets
Ziri followed Rima home
Ziri phoned the police
Ziri still had the camera
Ziri was walking to his car
Ziri looked exactly like Walid
Ziri hated his family
The transaction was complete
Ziri was arrested on the spot
Ziri said some very bad things
No sounds came from the woods
It was just a big hyena
The cameras picked up no sound
Ziri is done with the pain
It took a long time
It seemed like ages to me
It felt like an eternity to me
It felt to me like an eternity
Ziri went backpacking
Ziri figured he needed to stop
Ziri stopped and set up a camp
Ziri got the fire going
They were here not long ago
Ziri slept in his boots
Ziri weighed his options
Ziri walked in the pitch dark
Ziri sneaked up on Rima
The noise was far off
Ziri sprinted to his car
Ziri stopped at a gas station
Ziri exited the store
Ziri pretended to catch a bird
There was a bird in the cage
Ziri sat perfectly still
Ziri heard a whisper
Ziri heard Rima breathing
A tiger has been hunting us
Ziri got super hungry
Ziri sat and rested for a bit
Ziri came across a steep slope
Ziri saw a clearing
Ziri checked the clearing out
Ziri was all muddy
Ziri sat by the campfire
Ziri started to do that
Ziri lives in northern Algeria
Ziri liked biking
Ziri was riding
Ziri headed to the mountains
Ziri headed out
Ziri met people along the way
War has returned to Europe
Ziri met Rima in the mountains
Ziri was going to ask Rima out
Ziri needed to be with Rima
Ziri would wait for Rima
Ziri took a picture with Rima
Ziri followed the trail down
Ziri left the area in his van
The woods went dead silent
Ziri was a naive kid
Ziri started to get frightened
Ziri had to leave then
Ziri sprinted back home
Ziri has finally gotten home
Ziri returned to his tent
Ziri was finally getting tired
Ziri sat by the dying fire
Ziri entered the tent
Ziri accidentally woke Rima up
Ziri started a fire with Rima
The monks were meditating
The noise was outside the tent
The noise became more intense
Ziri started snoring again
Ziri tried to go back to sleep
The response is no
The train was overly crowded
Ziri gave commands to his dog
Ziri met that man on the train
Ziri judged Rima hardly
Ziri reached his destination
Ziri traveled during the night
It sounded like a dog crying
Ziri took that dog with him
Ziri called for the dog
The dog was alone and afraid
The puppy was hit by a car
The dog walked on its own
Ziri opened the Quran
Ziri wanted to scare hikers
The campfire went off
Ziri ran into the woods
The puppies were fussy again
Ziri reignited the fire
Ziri searched for firewood
Ziri looked at the fire
The light turned blue
Ziri went back into the tent
Ziri was with his dog
Ziri lit himself a torch
The Tassili Park is massive
Ziri stayed on the road
The snow is blinding
Ziri left Rima out in the cold
Ziri knew he hit something
Ziri hit the guardrail
Ziri hit a hyena
He looked down
Ziri got to his truck
Ziri slid under the truck
The car lurched to the side
Snow accumulated around
The road was gone
Ziri is getting closer
Ziri slipped off the edge
The hyena bared its teeth
The hyena sniffed at Ziri
Ziri pulled out his phone
Ziri used to be a ranger
Ziri stayed away from them
Ziri was in some sort of shock
Ziri ran back in
Ziri carried the dog out
Ziri talked to the campers
Ziri has got rabies
The jackal killed the gazelle
Ziri has had a traumatic night
Ziri heard a car start
Ziri approached the pond
The footprints were massive
Ziri poached a gazelle
Ziri found blood all over
Ziri showed Rima the door
The blue door slid open
The door slid open
Ziri spotted the hyena
Ziri went to the broken door
Ziri thanked Rima as she left
Ziri was wearing deodorant
People were panicking
People wanted their money back
Ziri was in a bodybag
Ziri pointed to Rima
Ziri went to a nearby pond
Ziri used the pond to hide
Ziri was under the water
Ziri gasped for air
Ziri walked out of the pond
Ziri had to find out
Ziri was going down
Ziri has become claustrophobic
Ziri checked his watch
The trail was barely visible
Ziri was back in the pond
Ziri swam to the side
Ziri swam to the next pond
Ziri came here every weekend
Ziri went home frustrated
Ziri felt free to do his thing
Ziri stared at the picture
Ziri tranquilized the hyena
Ziri said that wearily
Ziri was smiling ear to ear
Ziri had his camera set up
Ziri saw someone in the house
Ziri was wearing a wetsuit
Ziri stopped feeding the fish
Ziri became desperate
Ziri was the only tenant left
Ziri chose the fourth option
Ziri smelt the scent of fish
Ziri packed and left
Ziri slept restlessly
Give them back to him
All we do is lie
Tom did them the same
We miss our dog very much
I bought the last two tickets
The prison is small
We will celebrate with Tom
Most towns have an airport
I had to give it back to Tom
I had to return it to Tom
My grandchild is eight
That was a big step backward
Tom looked at Mary blankly
Tom looked up in surprise
Tom was without symptoms
Tom needs to sleep
We went there with Tom
You need to tell Tom
You ought to tell Tom
Ziri loves the great outdoors
Ziri writes amazing stories
Ziri is a story narrator
Ziri tried not to panic
The eagle was just above Ziri
Ziri ran down the narrow path
Ziri climbed the boulder
Ziri listened for a bit
The sound got so annoying
Ziri talked about Tuareg lore
Ziri stayed in the cave alone
Things started getting worse
Ziri went out to smoke
Ziri rushed inside
Ziri took a detour
Ziri took a detour instead
Ziri hit his hazards
A fuse must have blown
Ziri was trying to fix his van
Ziri slammed the hood shut
It was a foggy night
It was an idiotic idea
Ziri was on the mountain route
Ziri was interviewed on TV
Ziri got a coffee
Ziri checked over his car
The windows were wet
Nothing can scare Ziri
Ziri was a young boy then
Ziri purchased a new camera
Ziri walked around the tree
The bird went inside the tree
It would mean a lot to Ziri
Ziri walked into the woods
The crunching started again
Ziri started moving again
Ziri made his way up the hill
Ziri got frustrated
Ziri was in a tree
Ziri went back early
Ziri was running full sprint
Ziri parked the truck
Ziri entered the rifle range
Ziri stood to shoot
Ziri sat to shoot
The place has become shabby
The gazelle started running
Ziri ran faster
Ziri ran around the corner
Ziri was pushing Rima forward
Ziri began hiking in Chrea
Hobos live there
Ziri went on a dropping trip
Ziri just chuckled
Ziri heard a crying dog
Ziri was running away
Ziri arrived home last
Ziri immediately got back up
Panicking never helps
Ziri was cursing and groaning
Ziri stopped instantly
Ziri moved the backpack
Ziri ran away from the cabin
Ziri got lost in the desert
Ziri was too strong
Ziri loves campfire stories
Ziri went to the cabin
The bobcat was hissing at Ziri
Ziri was covered in blood
Ziri saw the head of a jackal
Ziri felt stupid
Ziri heard Rima giggle
Ziri heard a growl
The doors creaked
Ziri winked at Rima
Ziri hugged Rima again
Ziri was sipping his tea
Ziri put his cup down
Ziri walked towards the lake
Ziri spoke in a drunken voice
Ziri was sitting dead still
Ziri collapsed onto the couch
Ziri loved being in the woods
Hyenas inhabit those woods
Ziri tries to help people
Ziri took a lesser known path
Ziri got lunch ready
Ziri agreed to play
Ziri tried to surprise Rima
The search ended on Thursday
Ziri began to resent Rima
Ziri kept searching for Rima
The rifle is lightweight
Ziri has finally found Rima
Ziri pulled the trigger slowly
Ziri was frozen in fear
Ziri was up in the tree
Ziri was getting smarter
Stay on the mountain trails
It could mean your life
Ziri lives in a suburban area
Bring me the compass
We head northwards
The capital is in the south
It can still be fixed
It can still be repaired
Go to the front building
We can turn the tide together
Tom prefers solitude
Tom went instead of me
Tom lost his kite in a tree
Tom was about to leave
I want to play tennis
You should try to walk more
Pull out the plug
Pull the plug out
Tom is a widower now
Tom is now a widower
My cousin is a famous VTuber
Tom is likely to agree
Tom had nowhere to hide
Ziri stepped out of the tent
Ziri kept pushing
Ziri was an uncaring homeowner
The street lights were on
Ziri was in an oak forest
Ziri has good eyesight
The cabin had a fence
Ziri hates roommate drama
Ziri cleared the underbrush
Ziri kept the dog outside
Ziri felt bad for his dog
The gate is unlocked
Ziri was in a weed jungle
The woods went silent
The dog was defensive
The gazelle was close to Ziri
Ziri put the dog in the kennel
Ziri was facing the building
Another light was on
One of the rooms lit up
The other room lit up
Ziri thought it was hilarious
Both the rooms were lit up
The moon is in the same spot
Both rooms went dark
Are there any lights in there
The place was trashed
It feels bizarre down there
Ziri avoids that trail
Ziri set up his new tent
Ziri brought some comic books
Ziri felt uneasy
Ziri got set up for the night
The gazelle kept walking
Ziri got edgy and irritable
Ziri felt uneasy and unwelcome
Ziri is good at cutting hair
Ziri never makes mistakes
Ziri backed away
Ziri was almost in tears
Ziri avoids that backyard
Ziri is an avid angler
There is a fantastic view here
Four hours have already passed
Ziri was hiking back home
Ziri had a knife on him
The gazelle came near Ziri
There was no more splashing
Ziri never saw a thing there
Dust clouded the air
Ziri told Rima where he was
Ziri never stopped running
Ziri swore like a sailor
I have a leaky tap
I need to have a rest
Ziri took that trail
Ziri was trying to move fast
Ziri unlocked his Mitsubishi
I warned him several times
I got a bit lost in the woods
He gave me a bunch of flowers
Ziri felt very creeped out
Ziri walked a couple of feet
I posted the letter for you
How clumsy of me
The canopy was so dense
Those are not my words
Ziri was driving very slowly
Ziri kept pushing forward
Ziri drove in reverse
Ziri drove into the dark woods
Ziri went trekking there
Ziri was going to hunt there
Ziri walked down the trail
Ziri was still not back
Ziri is an experienced hunter
Ziri was too afraid to yell
Ziri never went hunting again
Ziri was also fourteen
Ziri was afraid of leopards
Ziri was outside the tent
A gazelle passed by
This sounds a little cliche
Ziri went off into the woods
Ziri wrote in his journal
Even the air was dead still
It was honestly terrifying
Ziri heard twigs snapping
Be careful in the woods
Ziri does wildlife photography
Ziri frequently goes hiking
The campground was defunct
Ziri should turn around now
Ziri walked back to the camp
The feeling was gone entirely
It was probably just a gazelle
Ziri followed a small creek
Ziri started running in fear
Ziri lives in rural Algeria
The trail is known by locals
The path was overgrown
Ziri was looking right at Rima
Ziri made more noise
The gazelle was eerily frozen
Ziri called out to the hunter
The figure has now vanished
The sound of the river faded
Ziri quickened his pace
The noises behind me stopped
Birds started chirping again
The Yautja can move quickly
The creature had black fur
The hyena crossed the creek
Ziri began setting up his tent
Ziri used to hunt around here
I began to look around us
Ziri started to cook
Ziri soon went to sleep
Ziri zipped open his tent
Ziri blamed that on alcohol
Ziri hates rest areas
Ziri carried his dog
Ziri told his dog to come on
Ziri needs to think rationally
Ziri went for the car
Ziri walked past the car
Ziri asked if Rima was OK
This dog is too cute to lose
Ziri hates rest areas now
Know yourself by yourself
Ziri found a nice ranch house
The gnome returned at night
The gnome smiled and ran away
I know you will say yes
He left you a note
Just say I want it
Change your avatar
Change your profile pic
He died in his cell
It will be safer with Tom
The park is opposite my house
My father lives next door
Nobody heard the blast
She suspected him of cheating
She was a beautiful woman
Write down my number
Tom suggested we go for a swim
I was too busy last week
Tom needs another car
Tom is out of petrol
Tom is out of gas
Give me your credit card
Tom promised he would change
Alice did not see this dog
Stop pretending to be asleep
I handed the car keys to Tom
I handed Tom the car keys
We have the same blood type
I told you no
I told you yes
I told them yes
It is my house
This is their home
Here is our house
It is your house
Tom needs to be more confident
Tom wrung his hands
Tom is on edge today
Let Tom in now
Let Tom in at once
Let Tom in right away
Mary is a shy girl
Tom called in sick yesterday
Tom is a real peach
She won a bike
She won a bicycle
Hold on to me tight
I hate dining alone
Tom hurt his left foot
Thanks for having been with us
She went back to Africa
He wrote them a letter
They need proof
Tom is going there
I try to be polite
About two hours went by
Our society is falling apart
Their father is Japanese
Our country is in shambles
I love my grandparents
I love grandma and grandpa
I am to your left
We will bring an end to it
No
Tom has already been forgiven
Sorry
I had a good laugh
We were just talking
Nothing else
We can change the future yet
I was ten minutes late
Mary dropped out of school
These lies are unforgivable
We have got no identity card
We feel we have got no rights
It is the first lesson
I keep complaining
This time they rested a bit
Our hearts are full of anger
Help people if you can
His instructions were not good
Everybody has a price
He is embarrassed to ask
Using cash means liberty
He is reading a book
Tom is organizing this event
This event is organised by Tom
Some of you may die
Ziri ignores toxic people
Ziri chose to ignore Rima
A fence surrounded the forest
Ziri was yelling for his life
The creature started running
Rima is in labor right now
Ziri took a longer route
The scream came again
Ziri walked back to his car
Ziri heard a different sound
Ziri reached the hospital
Ziri wore no clothes
Ziri heard a scratching sound
Ziri spoke in a singsong voice
Ziri closed the closet door
The creature had rotting skin
Ziri heard the creature laugh
Ziri hiked in a nice place
Ziri pointed to the clearing
Ziri felt honored
Ziri felt terrified
The four of us formed a circle
Ziri scanned the woods
Ziri thought it was a dog
Ziri grabbed a baseball bat
This story is new to me
Ziri lived in the deep woods
Ziri and Rima soon separated
It was amazing to be alone
Ziri left Rima vulnerable
Ziri heard jackals
Ziri heard the bear sniffing
Ziri made Rima pee her pants
Ziri looked outside his tent
There were no birds jumping
Ziri made it to the festival
Ziri left the trail
Ziri was in the deep woods
The trail is always there
Ziri knows the adage
It was quickly getting dark
Ziri saw the bike headlight
Ziri packed everything up
Ziri eventually dozed off
Ziri stepped out of his truck
Ziri reached the crest
Ziri confirmed his suspicion
Ziri reached the valley floor
Ziri was nearing the clearing
Ziri tried to push the boulder
Ziri rushed to help Rima
Ziri started yelling in Berber
The barrels were empty
Ziri attempted to console Rima
Ziri sat back in relief
Ziri had so many questions
Ziri locked his truck
Ziri asked about the girl
Ziri was kidnapped in Colombia
Ziri returned home safely
Ziri continued drinking
Ziri heard a commotion outside
A little exercise never hurts
Ziri was looking for the trail
Ziri saw what Rima saw
Ziri yelled in pain
Ziri jerked his hand away
Children are not welcome
My mother gave me this ring
He wore a very loud tie
He was wearing a garish tie
Petrol prices have fallen
Mary got angry with me
Mary got cross with me
Tom ran out of petrol
I see a shadow in the garden
Tom put petrol in the car
I bet Tom was happy
Tom prefers staying at home
All your cats are grey
My telly has packed up again
They have proved themselves
They walked towards the gate
I just met her in the street
It is better to eat dry bread
We had a nice conversation
The time is ripe for change
They have differing opinions
Guinea pigs are popular pets
I hope you have a nice day
I hope you have a nice evening
I hope you have a nice time
We hope you have fun
We hope you enjoy yourselves
He works in a garden centre
Stop fighting
It will get us nowhere
She works in a garden centre
Ziri ran away from the scene
One of the hunters shot Ziri
Ziri stumbled upon an oak tree
Ziri ran to the bridge
Ziri could only weep
Ziri is in leopard territory
Ziri had a long unkempt beard
Ziri was boring
Ziri cooked food that night
The food was not there
The leopard came for the food
Ziri grabbed his hunting knife
We should meet again soon
We should meet up again soon
Ziri was above the treeline
Ziri tried his best to sleep
Ziri was certain Rima was gone
Ziri abandoned his campsite
Please tell me what you need

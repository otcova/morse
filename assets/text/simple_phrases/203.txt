They entered the room
They recognized each other
They unlocked the door
Things are getting serious
This book is useful
This drug works well
This is extremely confidential
This seat is taken
The city has a long coastline
He was a year behind me
He was two years below me
He was a year ahead of me
He was two years above me
Small world
He was talking as he walked
I like your mirrors
He really knows how to cook
What I need is your time
He wants to sing old songs
Children like fruit juice
His ideas are crazy
She was talking as she walked
She needs an umbrella
She wants to sing old songs
She really knows how to cook
I like your eyeglasses
His Japanese is almost perfect
We all just want to be loved
I just want to be loved
You have no life
People are stupid
I went home and cried
She went home and cried
He loves me for who I am
She loves me for who I am
I grew up in a mining town
Look up to me
Taxes are too high
He has to be taller than me
He was shorter than me
The spice must flow
They sat in a circle
My mom is overprotective
See you in a minute
He saw everything
She saw everything
They tried to cheer me up
I tried to cheer her up
I tried to cheer him up
We tried to cheer her up
We tried to cheer him up
Tom tried to cheer Mary up
Most of my friends are guys
Most of my friends are girls
Lie on the couch
The experiment must begin
She pretended to be my friend
He pretended to be my friend
He looked surprised
She looked surprised
You took advantage of me
She took advantage of me
He took advantage of me
She asked me to
He asked me to
Tom is a correctional officer
She is very cunning
You have no idea
You have to find your own way
You need to find your own way
She was my best friend
He was my best friend
You sure are good at English
You ought to adjust the clock
Science is not fantasy
Days are shorter in winter
The frog came out of the water
He needs help
I ordered pizza by telephone
She is an expert
I fell asleep in class
This is the best way
Tom has something to ask Mary
One of us has to do this
I saw someone go into the room
My friend wants to talk to you
Morphology is reduced
The speaker is from Malaysia
We cannot do that
I saw Tom with Mary
Hold still
I tried
It failed
It worked
Tom approached
Tom paused
He must be a quack doctor
I kicked the dog
The dog was kicked by me
I drink
I sing
Education was mostly at home
She figured as a gray eminence
A church is a place to pray
The English almost came last
The girl looked at him too
I will never forgive him
I will never forgive her
She will never forgive me
He will never forgive me
Thank you for your hard work
Lock and barricade all doors
Lock windows and close blinds
Turn cell phone ringers off
I found a way out
Browsers are not all secure
She heaped praise upon him
The tie is very beautiful
I would rather die than submit
I would rather fail than copy
I know the consequences
I must accept the consequences
I understand the consequences
There could be consequences
There were no consequences
There will be consequences
Take only what you need
Please provide names
Well someone has to be good
Some place
Some woman
Some man
Some car
Some bike
Some house
Some computer
Some news
You can stay if you like
You make me want to laugh
You mean nothing to me
You might want to go with us
You said you wanted proof
You seem to be having fun
You seem to be in love
You seem to be in pain
You seem to have hurt yourself
You still seem to be upset
I agree with what you said
Let me guess
Do it
Everything will be fine
I can fix it
Tom will be here
Tom will forgive you
The vote has been doctored
I confess that I am guilty
An apple fell on the ground
The flower is not black
I confused her with her sister
Walking is the best exercise
Fishing is my favorite hobby
I dream of being in Japan
You may not pick the flowers
Your shoe stinks
Your shoes stink

If only Tom could see you now
If only he could see you now
If only she could see you now
We drove into the mountains
We drove into the night
I apologized profusely
He apologized profusely
She apologized profusely
He likes to talk about himself
I like to play with words
Our love will last forever
They spent the night together
I like your pair of eyeglasses
You really are fond of eating
It never happened again
It will never happen again
It will never happen again
I swear
She blamed me for everything
He shaved his head
She shaved her head
He has a huge ego
They made a perfect couple
They make a perfect couple
They took a walk on the beach
It was a hot summer day
We ate eggs

He is really clever
Tom speaks three languages
I love pizza

This is a triangle
He talks a lot
I am from the City of Manila
This is ours
This is our bag
They are jealous of us
Good music speaks for itself
He works in a saw mill
There are carp in the pond
I saw her there
I saw him there
I saw you there
This is a good point
I am a human being
I think he really likes me
I think he genuinely likes me
I feel a little insecure
He was abducted by aliens
He heard the sea in a seashell
The forest was dark
He died of pneumonia
She died of tuberculosis
They became close friends
She sells sea shells
He opened his mouth
She opened her mouth
It was her idea
It was his idea
She came home crying
They have an open relationship
We have an open relationship

I think we should take a break
She wants children
We still love each other
He asked me out
She asked me out
I like singing in the rain

I have work to do
Tom is always studying
Louisiana belonged to France
Everyone had to learn English
I want a coffee
Aluminium is a metal
I come from Holland
I want to live here
This water is odourless
What a shame
Thunderstorms are scary
He was hit by lightning
She was struck by lightning
She triumphed against all odds
A new pope has been elected
It was not unexpected
The new pope is called Francis
I can wait
I made a mistake while looking
I misread
You have a small chest
She did the bare minimum
I only did the bare minimum
I want a new kitchen
I want a kitchen like this
She wants a bigger kitchen
Tom was nowhere to be seen
He was nowhere to be seen
She was nowhere to be seen
He wakes up at noon
I was almost right
I felt guilty
I felt guilty about it
She still plays with dolls
I like her personality
I like your personality
It was just a hookup
Check out those legs
The countryside is beautiful
People die every day
Good people die every day
Many good people die every day
I think we should go there
We need talented people
We need more talented people
Please show me that
I never work during weekends
I hate her now
I met her at a club
I met him at a club
I bought it in a thrift store

He undressed me with his eyes
We ate at the food court
Peace be with you
I know nothing yet
I love trying new things
I love trying to do new things
He tried to lighten the mood
I feel sorry for him
He loves trying new things
She loves trying new things
Because I hate you
Cut the rope
This sucks big time
I left

I could come with you
I could die tomorrow

I could do that
I could do this for a living
I could do this for a while
I could do this for days
I could do this forever
I could do this myself
I could do with some rest
I could fall in love with you
I could fire you for that
I could get fired for this
I could get used to this
I could go to jail
I could go with Tom
I could go with you
I could have been a star
I could have been hurt
I could have been injured
I could have been killed
I could have died tonight
I could have done it by myself
I could have helped
I could have lost my job
I could have prevented this
I could have told you that
I could have used that
I could hear Tom yelling
I could help Tom
I could help you out
I could help you with it
I could help you with that
I could help you
I could just refuse to go
I could kiss you right now
I could look into the matter
I could lose my job
I could lose my license
I could lose my pension
I could make her talk
I could make you help us
I could never be like you
I could never do that to Tom
I could never do that
I could never hate you
I could never replace Tom
I could order you to do that
I could order that for you
I could order you to stay
I could really use a drink
I could really use a hug
I could sell this
I could stay with you
I could still change my mind
I could sure use a drink
I could sure use your help
I could talk to Tom
I could use a little help here
I could use a little help
I could use a little sleep
I could use some advice
I could use some help here
I could use the practice
I could use your help
I could walk from here
I could write a book
She forgot to lock the door
I think he hates me
I think she hates me
It would be perfect

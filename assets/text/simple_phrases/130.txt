The bridge is one mile above
I saw a boat above the bridge
It was dark under the bridge
The professor smiled
Keep your classroom clean
Get out of the classroom
The church bells are ringing
Education starts at home
Teaching is learning
Show it to me please
Thank you for the information
Dinosaurs are now extinct
Fear robbed him of speech
A terrible fate awaited him
She is probably over forty
The heat is intense
A strong wind began to set in
The wind blew in gusts
There was a strong wind
The robber bashed her head in
Robbers wrecked the mail train
The robbers fell on her there
A burglar broke into his house
The slugger was easily put out
The strong must help the weak
A strong wind was blowing
The strong winds were blowing
A strong wind arose
The society made him president
He came in fifth in the race
Supply is relative to demand
You should visit Kyoto
Kyoto is worth visiting
Kyoto is not as large as Osaka
Kyoto is worth visiting once
Summers are very hot in Kyoto
Kyoto has many universities
Kyoto has many places to see
I have been to Kyoto once
Kyoko is lying on the grass
They sell fish and meat
Fish live in the water
Fish cannot live out of water
Fish live in the sea
A fish can swim
I nearly choked on a fishbone
Fishing is not in my life
A fish leaped out of the water
The fish is burnt black
We talked quite frankly
A huge tanker put off just now
I had a miscarriage last year
I had a stroke last year
I had otitis media last year
I lost my wife last year
I took an art class last year
The crops failed last year
We had a lot of snow last year
We had a lot of rain last year
We had a mild winter last year
We moved to New York last fall
She went there last summer
We had a kid just last year
Out of sight out of mind
Add a little milk
I bought two bottles of milk
I want a quart of milk
Milk is a popular beverage
Milk does not agree with me
Milk makes us strong
Milk easily turns sour
Milk is a good beverage
Milk is made into butter
Milk will do you good
The milk turned sour
Blend milk and eggs together
The milk has gone bad
The milk has turned sour
I raise cattle
A cow is a useful animal
The cows looked big and docile
Cows live on grass
Cattle feed on grass
Cows give us milk
Cows provide us with milk
Cows provide us with good milk
The cow is anything but bright
Cows are anything but bright
The cow supplies us with milk
Cows supply us with milk
A cow gives us milk
Cows are sacred to Hindus
Yoke the oxen to the plow
The cows are eating grass
I ran into an old friend
Old friends called on me
The printer needs paper
The waiter brought a new plate
He will wriggle out of the fix
A cornered rat will bite a cat
The stadium was quite still
The ball slightly curved
The ball bounced over the wall
Misfortunes never come singly
We just have to swallow it
Rub salt in the wound
I feel like crying
Try to keep from crying
Crying is of no avail
It only adds fuel to the fire
Call an ambulance
Please send an ambulance
I need medical help
I burst into tears
He suddenly missed his watch
Suddenly the heavens opened
Suddenly I got lucky
Suddenly rain began to fall
The storm broke
Hurry up
There seems no need to hurry
The concert is starting
You can take your time
Mr Itoh will call the roll
I must hurry to class
I hurried home
I rushed out of my house
Be more careful
Haste makes waste
Please hurry
Hurry up
Hurry up
Here comes the bus
You had better hurry
The train leaves at three
All my haste was in vain
The palace has a tall tower
Blotting paper absorbs ink
I will help you all I can
You just need a good rest
Enjoy your holidays
Take a rest
Fuji
Enjoy your vacation
Make the most of your vacation
The holiday ended all too soon
My vacation went by quickly
He is lively during recess
Too much rest is rust
The hill lay covered with snow
The hill is always green
Fuji
There is a house on the hill
We came in sight of the hill
Adversity is the best school
The converse is also true
Please turn over
The visitor sat across from me
The guests are all gone
The customer did not come
Please refrain from smoking
Smoking is strictly prohibited
Smoking means suicide
Smoking is harmful to health
Smoking affects your health
Smoking affects our health
Smoking is bad for the health
Smoking does damage your lungs
Smoking is bad for you
Smoking has affected his lungs
Here is the confirmation card
Chrysanthemums smell sweet
The discussion was heated
The argument ended in a fight
Women will have the last word
It is hardly worth discussing
The chairperson cut me short
Suppose we change the subject
Congress went into recess
Parliament has been dissolved
It was just polite applause
Try to fulfill your duty
You must do your duty
There is no room for doubt
One thing remains doubtful
There is little room for doubt
Beware of imitations
Hypocrisy is my abhorrence
Disease and famine go together
Hunger knows no law
Hunger impelled him to crime
Shine on my brilliant soul
All that glitters is not gold
You need not have woken me up
Time to get up
It is too early to get up
What is done cannot be undone
Go to the hospital
You are beautiful
You are her daughters
You are teachers
You are human
You are actresses
You are the only one
You are doctors
You are much too kind to me
You lent a book
You have a telephone

You go to the Chikushi river
You are my best friend
You like Kawaguchi
You tried
You like elephants
You have three cars
You drink tea
You study English

Your shoes want mending
Your tap water is too hard
Get a water softener
You have tennis elbow
Soak your arm in warm water
Your dog has worms
Give him vitamins
He was created a peer
Put your valuables in the safe
I read about All Ball
My memory is failing
A good memory is his weapon
It is still fresh in my memory
Rules are to be observed
We must observe the rules
Just keep your fingers crossed
The train has not arrived yet
The train is ready to start
The train traversed a tunnel
The train was due at six
The train was derailed
Our train stopped suddenly
Because she felt sick
I feel refreshed
You have to be patient
He gives me the creeps
Try and calm down
I understand how you feel
Speak your mind
I really feel for you
I know how you feel
A strange feeling came over me
I really enjoy the climate
Please make yourself at home
Care aged him quickly
Worry affected his health
The balloon descended slowly
Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
The barometer is falling
It is going to rain
Take care
I fainted
Let your hair down a little
Take heart and do it again
The weather is fickle
Please think nothing of it
Never mind
Never mind
Anyone can make mistakes
Caring means being alive
I just brush it off
Forget it
I appreciate your concern
Turn off the television
I found myself back in my room
I met nobody on my way home
I met him on my way home
You can go home if you like
You are home late
Wait here till I come back
So nice that you are back
Wit gives zest to conversation
He is cranky
I got the machine running
The machines are idle now
You must feed the machine
There were two abstentions
The restaurant was a bummer
Let bygones be bygones
As you already know
The flag is up
Keep sight of the flag
The desk is covered with dust
The watch on the desk is mine
Look at the book on the desk
A book is lying on the desk
I see a book on the desk
There is a book on the desk
There is a map on the desk
There is a fan on the desk
There is a key on the desk
I see a flower on the desk
There is an album on the desk
There is a card on the desk
There is an apple on the desk
There is one apple on the desk
There are no pens on the desk
There is a pen on the desk
There is a bag on the desk
There is a cat under the desk
The desk drawer is open
I put down a rug under my desk
I am tied to my desk and chair
I agree with you to a degree
You must not give up hope
No one can turn the clock back
I was too glad not to jump up
A novel idea occurred to me
We gladly accept your offer
I will gladly help you
I will be glad to help you
I am ready to go with you
I will be pleased to help you
Joy was mingled with sorrow
Her face was animated by joy
I jumped for joy
His joy showed on his face
Danger
I almost missed the train
I was nearly run over by a car
The weather is threatening
I came near to being drowned
I was almost run over by a car
I barely missed being struck
I had a narrow escape
We soon believe what we desire
I hope my dream will come true
You look pale
He looks pale
You look pale
You look pale
You look green
Wash your face
He told me to wash my face
Wipe your face clean
Turn your face this way
Wash up
Your face is red
My cheeks burn
My face twitches
You can do it
I try
Look out for rock slides
Survey the landscape below
Silence grows like cancer
The logs flamed brightly
Korea is now up and coming
We hope to lower the tariff
He was saved by a hair
That was a close call
It was you that were wrong
It is you who is in the wrong
I must have made a mistake
You have the wrong number
You better believe it
An error was made
Easter will soon come around
Walk fast so as to be in time
Send me the account
You look very dignified
All the audience was excited
His home run excited the crowd
The audience appeared bored
The can is empty
Just ask anybody
Brevity is the soul of wit
I need a concise explanation
Water shot from the pipe
Nurses attend sick people
The nurse is dressed in white
The nurse gave me a shot
A nurse wears white
The nurse took his temperature
A nurse took my temperature
Two nurses are attending her
I want something sweet
Kanji are difficult to read
The shouting echoes loud
Shouts of joy burst forth
The cheers swelled to a roar
Familiarity breeds contempt
I was moved to tears
The bill was paid in coin
Happy Thanksgiving Day
The patient was allowed up
Dried fish is not to my taste
We stored the hay in the barn
Try to be generous and forgive
Perfection is a trifle dull
It cannot be completely cured
Fluency in English is a must
Give me a break
Please add up the bill
The bill must be paid today
Business is business
Charge this bill to me
A cold spell gripped Europe
A cold wave passed over Japan
I have a chill
I feel cold
I have very bad chills
I do feel the cold
I feel cold
My teeth chattered with cold
Cold winter came on
Cold weather is coming
I feel cold
Dry wood burns quickly
Dry sand absorbs water
Bring me a dry towel
The Kamo runs through Kyoto
Air the futon
The stock market tumbled
Stocks fell hard
Stock prices dropped
Stocks hit a new high
You may leave your bag here
I need a bag
Well begun is half done
The eagle does not catch flies
Hang your coat on the hook
My forehead burned with fever
Wipe the sweat from your brow
Come feel my forehead
The band sprang into life
The band paraded the streets
After a storm comes a calm

Have a nice time
Have a good time
We are having a good time
Enjoy your trip
I wish you a pleasant voyage
I hope you had a nice trip
Have a nice weekend
Have a nice flight
Have a nice vacation
Have a nice summer vacation
Pleasure is the source of pain
The pupils burst out laughing
Students are apt to waste time
Study the student more
Half the students were absent
Admission to students only
Allow a student to be absent
His students adored him
The students performed Hamlet
A student wants to see you
Three students
He is something of a scholar
He is proud of his scholarship
He ended up expelled
I graduated from the school
I met her on my way to school
I met Tom on my way to school
He was going to school
Go to school
School begins tomorrow
School begins in spring
School begins in April
School starts next Monday
School will open on Monday
School begins at nine
School reopens in September
Our school begins at eight
My school grades were average
You must follow school rules
I heard the school bell ring
I am very glad school is over
One is never too old to learn
No one is too old to learn
Not worth the remembered value
Remember it
Be sure to drop in at my house
Please make sure
You can certainly rely on him
I am positive that he is wrong
I did write to him
I did see him
He did not get any game
The expansion is aging
Each man must cast a vote
Go to your respective seats
Go to your posts
Give us a ride downtown
I want to see the streets
I cannot get the lid off
I like Chinese food in general
Some medicine does us harm
External application only
Foreigners admire Mt
Fuji
I want to go abroad
The air felt a little cold
Appearance is deceptive
I feel like going out
It seems warm outside
It was piercingly cold outside
It was pitch black outside
It is cold outdoors
Put on your coat
It is getting dark outdoors
It is getting dark outside
It is still light outside
It is dark outside
It is very cold outside
It is getting lighter outside
Get out
He would not go out
He is playing outdoors
I hear footsteps outside
Please invite us out to dinner
The sky is getting light
You can do it from the outside
Go up the stairs
Please come downstairs
Grand opening sale
I found the box empty
Open up
I draw for a hobby
Look at the picture
Never confuse art with life
The picture is hung crooked
May you all be happy
All were satisfied
Each is good in its degree
You are making history
With kind regards to you all
I will miss you all
Make yourselves comfortable
I hope you are all well
Everybody laughed
Everybody looks up to him
Everybody laughed at me
I broke your ashtray
I need an ashtray
Throw a sprat to catch a whale
The seawater stings my cut
They went to the beach
I work for a shipping company
The sea was truly calm
The ocean was calm
The sea was running high
The sea was as smooth as glass
The sea looks calm and smooth
The sea is far from calm
The sea grew wilder and wilder
The sea is very wide
I cast my net into the sea
It is fun to swim in the sea
The sea is down
The sea came into sight
The sea indented the coastline
The sun rose from the sea
Winds from the sea are moist
The sea is not clear
Turtles live to a great age
It is never too late to mend
I groped for a flashlight
I have plenty of money with me
There go the twelve bars blues
The Sphinx howled with rage
You will hurt yourself
I fix broken radios
Recovery was almost impossible
I order you to turn right
There was a thick fog around
You have to pay the price
This hall was full of people
I hope I can hold on to my job
Call me at the office
The company went after its no
The company is in deficit
We are having a meeting
The meeting was last month
The meeting will commence
The meeting will be put off
The meeting dragged on

The meeting is ten days away
Fix a date for the meeting
Attend the meeting
The audience filled the hall
All the members were present
Each member was called upon
The members decreased to five
The meeting was all but over
The meeting finished at nine
The meeting broke up at five
The meeting started at ten
The meeting was well attended
We never meet without parting

It is Tom whom I want to see
The buds are just showing
Bite the bullet

We hold the same principles
We decided by vote
We met along the way
We talked on the telephone
We prevailed over our enemy
We crept toward the enemy
We took the enemy by surprise
We fired guns at the enemy
We must die sooner or later
We felt the ground sinking
We sang in loud voices
We roared with laughter
We arrived at a compromise
We are forty three in all
We agreed to start early
There are seven of us
We all knelt down to pray
We are against war
We were driven to the wall
We take oil for granted
We sang songs in chorus
We need to nourish our spirit
We work for our living
We eat so we can live
We found him alive
We are to meet at noon
We argued politics
We are longing for world peace
We are anxious for world peace

We arrived first
We think we are over the worst
We must not go to war again
We need more workers
We toiled up a hill
We prepared for an attack
We stood face to face
We walked as far as the park
We sat on a bench in the park
We took turns with the driving
We took turns driving the car
We made camp near the lake
We found the front door locked
We deal in silk goods
We must control our passions
We will never agree
We fought a hard battle
We had to abandon our plan
We learn by experience
We went as far as Kyoto
We eat fish raw
We must be alert to dangers
We are free from danger
We were moved to tears
We definitely heard that sound
We had to obey the foreign law
We were all rather exhausted
We should stick to our plan

A mosquito just bit me
Never too much of anything
Make room for the baggage
Send your baggage in advance

Hold the vase in both hands
I filled a vase with water
The vase burst into fragments
The vase was broken to pieces
The vase crashed to pieces
Hanako called his bluff
Hanako likes cake very much
The bride suddenly laughed
The vase broke into fragments
Put some water into the vase
Flowers bloom
Flowers attract bees
The flowers are still in bud
Blossoms develop from buds
Flowers are always acceptable
We must water the flower
The flowers are opening
The flower will come out soon
The flowers withered up
The Diet will meet on Tuesday
A burnt child fears the fire
I lost my shoe in the fire
The fire alarm sounded
The fire alarm rang
Insure your house against fire
Keep the fire alive
Put out the fire
Fire is very dangerous
Fire burns
The fire was burning brightly
Fire is always dangerous
The fire went out
The fire went out by itself
The fire burned up brightly
There is no smoke without fire
It only adds fuel to the fire
I warmed myself at the fire
Keep away from the fire
Stay away from the fire
Be on your guard against fire
We sat over a fire
The fire is out
The fire is burning furiously

Let us go home
Both buildings burned down
The house was in flames
My house was on fire

A fence runs around the house
Our living room is sunny
Arrive home

I leave to go home
We had a lot of furniture
We have two television sets
He is away from home

The summer is over
It is so humid in summer here
The summer heat is rolling in
Grass is luxuriant in summer
Summer has come
Take every possible means
Mr Kato is a teacher
I live in Kakogawa
Some stores discount the price
The price reflects the demand
The price varies with demand
Prices seem to be going down
There are several flowers
No scam is too outrageous
Many times have I scolded him
Read it again and again
Thousands of people were there
Some boats are on the lake
Some were late
Somebody caught me by the arm
Getting nowhere
You can go anywhere you want
You may sit wherever you like
He had been walking for hours
I gazed at the sea for hours
It rained for hours and hours
Nothing happened
All things must have an end
Moderation in all things
Do your best in everything
Try your best in everything
Whatever may happen
A penny for your thoughts
We need money to do anything
I must think about what to do
It is clear what must be done
Tell me what to do

Most girls are kind
Most work is not very pleasant
Most whales feed on plankton
Most students study hard
Most students like sports
Most Americans like hamburgers
We buy eggs by the dozen
Do not read such a book
You should not speak so loud
I cannot afford to pay so much
We have no such example
You must not behave so
Put me in touch with her
Sleep off the problem
Pardon me for saying so
She must be a fool to say so
Forget about that right now
I thought as much
Give up such ideas
Like is hardly the word
That excuse will not do
Put the plan on the scrap heap
Such a plan is bound to fail
Such a plan can hardly succeed
Do not say such foolish things
Never have I seen such a thing
Stop staring at me like that
Put away such a foolish idea
Keep your temper
I can hear you
It is abnormal to eat so much
Do not vary your plan so often
I can hear you perfectly
That makes no difference
You ought not to smoke so much
You have given me so many
A short temper will cost you
I am blessed if I know it
He is inclined to exaggerate
Such a thing is of no account
I can scarcely believe it
It is rude of you to say so
To do so is asking for trouble
He must be a fool to do so
It is absolutely impossible
Not hardly
He eats like a goat
I was fool enough to do so
That cannot be true
I do nothing of the kind
Nobody will believe that rumor
Stop inhaling your food
You should eat a little slower
It is time I left here
Pick it up
It is about time I was going
Turn it off
He has not been heard of since
Beyond that I cannot help you
He led a hard life after that
I cannot take less
Send it by mail
Please bring it back tomorrow
Just wrap it up
Let me hear it
I am sad to hear it
I will keep it in my bosom
Cut it in half
He has enough money to buy it
I have no money to buy it
There is no one but knows it
Give it to anyone you like
Say it in another way
Put it back in the nest
I believe it to be true
I cannot help but laugh at it
Prove it by experiment
Look it up in the dictionary
I need a bag to carry it in
Bring it to me
Bring it back to me
Let me have a look at it
Please send it to me by fax
It is no use worrying about it
Send it by airmail
I shudder to think of it
That sure puts me on the spot
I wish you had told me that
I left it unlocked
Put it back where it was
I would like to see it
Let me see that
It took many years to build it
Put it back on the desk
We need a tool to open it with
I tried in vain to open it
Set it down there
Put it down
Drink it down
Well do I remember it
Leave it off the list
Try and do it
Let me help you wipe it off
I could not find it anyplace
Tell me what to do with it
Watch carefully how to do it
Please put it aside for me
Lay it on the table
You shall have it for nothing
Please say it by heart
Leave it there
He can do it if anybody
It is impossible to do it
Let it be done at once
Get it ready at once
Do it at once
There is no person to do it
I thought I must do it
Bring it here
I will give it to you
Divide it among the three
I sold it for ten dollars
I can read them all
Get them out of the way
Pack them in the box
They are important matters
They are our cars
These boded you no good
Those are not your chairs
They are all of a price
They are all of a size
They are very big apples
They will help you to get warm
Those books are mine
Their sizes are much the same
Those flowers have died
Those cowards ran away soon
Please put those chairs away
Those chairs are in the way
One of the dogs is alive
Many of the dogs are alive
Some of the dogs are alive
Some of them are really fine
I like this better than that
That is a good idea
Keep it in a cool place
It is contrary to reason
It looks like an egg
It is about the size of an egg
It went just as we expected
That was cooked in oil
That is out of the question
It is more than I can stand
That sounds interesting
You can have it for nothing
Your demands are unreasonable
It has resulted in nothing
It came to nothing
Let it hang
It sounds like a dream
To all appearance it is true
It appeared a true story
It cannot be true
That cannot have been true
It has to be true
It is really wonderful
It can not be true
It turned out true
That might have been true
It turned out to be true
She said that it might be true
It may or may not be true
It may be true
It is a book
I want to do it myself
That is the same color as mine
Those are my trousers
It is on me
It was a great shock to me
It was too difficult for me
It is what the law ordains
That is another matter
I am tired of hearing it
It was a partial success
It was only a partial success
Fuji
It is both good and cheap
It was a strange affair
It is necessary
Do it yourself by all means
It is not necessarily so
It is of great use
Keep it quiet
I think she made up that story
It is an insult to her
It has great weight with her
It was a mistake on their part
It is to his advantage
That is no business of his
It runs against his character
It is beginning to tell on him
Ask him about it
It will do him no harm
It has had no effect on him
It is too easy a task for him
That applies to him too
It is he
It is still immoral
That was an exciting game
Everybody was excited
That will fly on the market
It is a difficult problem
I found the book easy
It contained harmful chemicals
It is a moral question
It is contrary to the morals
It serves you right
It is smaller than Tokyo
It is a typical Gothic church
That is a matter of degrees
You should buy a new one
It is thirty meters in length
It was a long letter
It was simply an oversight
Anyone can do it easily
Anybody knows it
Please have someone else do it
It is of great value
It makes all the difference
That is quite possible
That was of great help to me
It may well be true
That makes no sense at all
It is a sheer waste of time
That is not altogether false
It was a sublime scenery
It is founded on supposition
This is a real popular item
No human power can manage that
That is not the case
God knows that it is true
It really hit the spot
That is all right
It is best left untouched
It is soft to the touch
It is merely an ornament
I just meant it as a joke
It became his habit by degrees
That is a new story to me
Off it went
It needs to be repaired
That was the end of the class
It will make for the society
It is just an act
It is in fact your fault
That is an actual fact
It is quite a grand view
It was a great blow to us
It gave me the creeps
It is abhorrent to me
It is a task beyond my power
That is not my line
That goes against my beliefs
It is beyond my power
It is outside my area of study
That is in my recollections
That is my own affair
It makes no difference to me
It is nothing to me
It seems very difficult for me
It was a revelation to me
It was a nervous moment for me
That has nothing to do with me
It is like the air we breathe
That is because I got up late
I am to blame for it
It is a childish act
It cannot be helped
It is only too true
The beginning showed it
It may occur at any moment
It is the in thing to do
It has become quite common
We got a good price for that
That is going too far
You had better leave it unsaid
That goes without saying
It is saying too much
It is horrible to see
It was a lovely sight to see
Leave it where you found it
It is not as good as it looks
It is by no means an easy job
It is anything but big
It is no joke
That will never disappear
It is by no means certain
It is merely a matter of form
That is a fruit of your effort
It is just your imagination
It rests on your decision
It is up to you
It was a chance meeting
It was a casual meeting
It happened by accident
It is an act of folly
It was shining in the sky
It is not to be wondered at
That is surprising
They are the extreme cases
It was a terrible accident
It happened last October
That is the other way about
It admits of no doubt
It is a stupendous project
It tasted sweet
It was a moving sight
It came apart
It serves our purpose
It was a blow to us
It will do harm to us
You can do it at your leisure
It is neither good nor bad
It was ages ago
It is something like a ball
I put it in the drawer
It is made partly of wood
It was a nightmare
I made it myself
It is an exciting night event
That is a studied insult
It looks like an apple
It depends
It smells delicious
It would be better to try
Keep it at a lower temperature
It is written in easy English
It must be done more carefully
It was hard as rock
That is quite another matter
It was just as I thought
It has nothing to do with you
It happened just like this
It was nothing but a joke
That was only a year ago
It was a very exciting game
It is sold by the pound
It makes little difference
It is next to impossible
It is of little value
It fell to pieces
That is a trivial problem
You find it in any dictionary
This sounds very interesting
That was no ordinary storm
It was a most beautiful flower
It was a very long meeting
It was a very big room
That gives me great pleasure
It was a very slow train
I cannot possibly do it
You can put it anywhere
I can not stomach it
It must be hard for you
It happened quite recently
That sounds a little off
It grew larger and larger
It moved closer and closer
I got it free
It was such a shock
That is not much of a problem
It was a poor concert
I had rented it the day before
They were all sold out
It all depends on the weather
It was all our faults
It all came to nothing
It was all covered with dust
That was some storm
That was a fearful scene
It was like this
It came about in this way
This is how it all came about
It shows white from here
Do it in this manner
Throw it away
It is quite a big number
Please take care of yourself
It is a kind of orange
Tell me when it came about
It has a pleasant odor
You made a good decision
It happened one night
It is true in a sense
It is true of every case
It is none of your business
It hangs on your decision
That is not your knife
It was less than fifty dollars
It is four centimeters thick
It was three days ago
That reads two different ways
It was about twenty dollars
It can be done in a day
There is one big difference
I meant it as a joke
It is called sick humor
It is characteristic of him
Tell me the right answer to it
Its color is red
Take hold of it
It has no parallel
Count me in
Keep away from that
And yet he could pass the exam
Add more water to it
She is charming for all that
It has my name on it
I have lost interest in it
It needs exercise
It would provoke a saint
I have some doubts about it
It has a value all its own
He was stiff about it
I will say something about it
It is no use arguing about it
You may take my word for it
There seems no doubt about it
That added to his unhappiness
So they were not able to dream
That is why he failed the exam
It accounts for the fact
That accounts for the accident
It made my hair stand on end
That would be fine
That leaves no room for doubt
He was punished all the same
It is none the less true
That will do me well
That would leave me in a fix
See you at two this afternoon
That will put you in danger
The angle would be too narrow
It will get you nowhere
And he calls himself a sailor
It may be all right
And she misses them very much
I would do anything but that
That would be sufficient
It is all I want to do
Each player did his best
Each child was given a present
This is urgent
I know that much myself
I admit it to be true
That accounts for her delay
That accounts of her delay
That was the time when he came
That is what I want to know
I do want it
That is the way of the world
That is the most I can do
That is all I have
That is how I learned English
That is your major problem
Goodness knows what it was
I have an idea what it is
It turned out all for the best
Then she began to walk again
Then he lay on the same bed
There followed a long silence
He died three days after
Then she hurried home
Nobody has seen him ever since
Then clean it really well
That is just her way
Whoever wants it may take it
Let me try it
That comes in handy
Clouds formed in the sky
The breeze kissed her face
A gentle wind is blowing
We would like to buy a sofa
I have a cold
The topic is worth discussing
Tell me the story
The story turned my blood cold
The story left him unmoved
Many a man believes the story
Tell me about it
A friend told me that story
The story was amusing
The story appears to be true
The story sounds true
The story was true
That story is household legend
I have heard the story
Let the matter drop
The story is full of humor
The story was very interesting
The story had a happy ending
The topic is taboo here
Part of the story is true
The story affected us deeply
Both stories are true
The story cannot be true

The night was so cold
The gate is closed at eight
That problem was accepted
I solved the problem easily
The problem remains unsolved
The problem perplexed him
The problem puzzled the public
The matter is of no importance
The problem tortured the chief
The problem is beyond my power
Leave the matter to me
Leave the matter to me
The problem was beyond me
The problem is far from easy
I found the problem was easy
The problem is not settled yet
Let the problem alone
The problem defies solution
The problem was very difficult
The matter is all settled
Subject closed
Please think about the problem

Read the book again and again
Put the book back where it was

This book is easy to read
I have read the book before
I have already read the book

That book had a lot of pages
I found the book interesting
Put the book on the top shelf
Orders for the book poured in

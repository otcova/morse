He is aggressive
You make me feel safe
You are safe here
We should be safe now

Put them near the fire
You only have to call Jean
You simply have to call Jean
You should see the film
He lies
She lies
You must have seen them there
You must have lost them
You look a sorry sight
You cannot use his
You can use mine
What he did drove me mad
We would have helped them
We went to see our neighbours
We thought you were sick
We started singing
We should trust the experts

Go into the office
Go and get me some wine
Everything should be in order

I put my mobile phone in it
Wait a second
My shoe is untied
He came across a wolf
These images are beautiful
Tom draws well
I bought a used truck
Life is what you make it
The cat escaped
She got her left ear pierced
She got her right ear pierced

His parents are well
He hates his neighbour
Lorry swims well
Lorry is good at swimming
I must cook breakfast for her
Tom swims well
I failed miserably
I have failed miserably
Tom is good at drawing
That was well written
That was well writ
Tom was in no particular hurry
Flap your wings or die
Tom mentioned your name to me
Tom mentioned it
Do it whenever you want
That church stands on a hill
Close it
He has cancer
Anyone is welcome to join
They were tortured
I want to learn Romanian
I want this puppy
Stop wasting my time
This is a waste of time
That was a waste of time
Stop wasting your breath
That was a waste of money
This is a waste of my time
This is all a waste of time
This is such a waste of time
This is just a waste of time
Please stop wasting our time
That would be a waste of time
It would be a sin to waste it
That was a total waste of time
Ask me a question
This is where I went to school
He wants revenge
He wants vengeance
Tom passed the ball to Mary
Tom passed the puck to Mary
I want to punch him
She copies everything I do
He copies everything I do
I feel like Tom is using me
Tom is super religious
Tom padded his resume
He wanted revenge
I know you love him
John grieves
John is sad
Do as you please
I can see a man and a woman
It was night
But a full moon was shining
You hate me
You returned
You remained
You followed
You fell
You entered
You died
She is as guilty as he is
It was extremely embarrassing
Tom is incredibly lazy
I tried to stop him
I tried to stop her
The baby is trying to sleep
This is unacceptable to me
You must be alert
Not one of us is local
I forgot to send the letter
This rope is very weak
Thank you for the support
Information is power
Stop lying to me
My son would never do that
Tom died in a tragic accident
I will go back and fetch it
They asked me to leave
He answered with a shaky voice
He looked at her eagerly
At least you have options
Here are two
I enjoy a full and varied life
Bonjour
Merci
Spread the love
Maybe you got the date wrong
Nothing was wrong
You owe me nothing
Nothing comes easy
That proves nothing
It could be nothing
We have done nothing
I still have nothing
Tom has nothing to do
We are doing something
Tom saw nothing at all
They saw something odd
There was nothing left
It meant nothing to me
It means nothing to me
You have nothing I want
Tom did nothing illegal
There was nothing there
Let me put something on
It was probably nothing
You might hear something
We have to try something
This means nothing to me
Think nothing more of it
There was nothing to see
There was nothing to say
That means nothing to me
Maybe I missed something
It was nothing important
It meant something to me
It has to mean something
You have something I want
Tom has something we want
Tom did something similar
They saw something strange
Let me try something else
I think I heard something
Tom tripped over something
I need you to do something
I forgot to pack something
Tom said he found something
Tom is choking on something
Tom is busy doing something
Nothing seems to be missing
Nothing I try seems to work
Nothing else really matters
We must be missing something
We have nothing left to lose
Tom is doing something there
There was nothing more to do
There was nothing I could do
There may be something there
The kids are up to something
That might lead to something
Maybe something will turn up
It has nothing to do with me
It had nothing to do with us
It had nothing to do with me
I have nothing to say to Tom
Tom says he did nothing wrong
This could all be for nothing
They saw something suspicious
They found nothing suspicious
Please show us something else
Please show me something else
Our kids need something to do
Let me just ask you something
It might be something serious
It has nothing to do with Tom
It had nothing to do with you
I wanted to ask you something
I picked something up for you
All this could be for nothing
We should get something to eat
We have nothing to worry about
We found something interesting
There was nothing Tom could do
There was nothing for us to do
That had nothing to do with me
Someone ought to say something
It has nothing to do with this
It has nothing to do with that
It has nothing to do with luck
It had nothing to do with this
It had nothing to do with that
I think we should do something
I need to figure something out
I did something I regret doing
We went for a walk in the park
We went for a walk after lunch
He is right who is happy
He crossed his legs
Three is one half of six
He is a dreamer
He looks haggard
She has two daughters
The radio broke down
He speaks no English
The woman eats bread
Osaka is larger than Kyoto
Lions are animals
Speak with me
I buy newspapers every day
She never stays long
My grandmother is very old
I will have to read the book
It may rain before long
Beauty lies within

I was in hospital for a week
Namibia is an African state
I need to sleep now
She has a swimming pool
He has a heated swimming pool
Tom is beginning to go deaf
He has enormous fingers
Knowledge is the supreme goal
Lead us from darkness to light
Knowledge is the supreme power
Touching the sky with glory

I ate a box of chocolates
Please educate me
Not bad for a beginner
I always take the bus
I like listening to him
Mary bought some bread
She has a cat and two dogs
He was born in Mexico
She often comes late
He is dishonest
She is dishonest
I went into the house
I drank tea
I ate an apple
I got on the horse
He crossed the bridge
The bottle broke on me
A penguin colony lives there
This gazelle is beautiful
This squirrel is shy
This squirrel is not shy
Just pretend nothing happened
My parents will pay for it
She was clearly in trouble
He was clearly in trouble
I need cigarettes
Aah
Now I understand
Now I understand
She often wears corduroys
We were dating at the time
Her family protected her
Her friends protected her

Tom is much cuter
Pick a card
Raisa is adorable
My whole body began to shake
Mary has sandy blonde hair
I have yoga practice
Galactose is a carbohydrate
Frictionless road ahead
There were no forks
I will miss Moldova
Love is stupid
Seldom do I forget my keys
Not once did she look at me
She found him a spot
Absolute truth does not exist
Tom was very happy
I wanna go to New York
I want to go to New York
I need a fish
This is not a new car
Good things are easily spoiled
Tom watched the team practice
It will be over soon
No ship is unsinkable
Tom will never betray us
Mary was like a sister to me
He found out by himself
She found out by herself
You throw like a girl
Shut up
Tom and I are talking
I am reading his book
I wanted to talk to you anyway
I have to go
I have other things to do
Everything changes over time
This material is cheaper
Please help me
I was just calling to say hi
Tom overheard our conversation
Sit up straight in your chair
Take your elbows off the table
She never listens to me
He started it
He never listens to me
Do what your mother said
My friends are waiting for me
You should know that by now
I was about to say something
I was crazy about that girl

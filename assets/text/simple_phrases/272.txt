You might get shot

Things got serious
Nobody got injured
Get ready to party
Get ready for more
We just got lucky
We can get better
We all got scared
Tom got well soon
Tom got up slowly
Tom got paid last
Get off the phone
We just got home
Things got scary
Things got messy
They got nothing
I got goosebumps
Go get some help

Tom gave the envelope to Mary
Give yourself enough time
Please give an example
That gives us hope
That gives me hope
Give me your watch
Give me the phone
I almost gave up
I went to a public high school
We went to Boston last summer
Tom went to the grocery store
I wish everyone would go home
Everything went very smoothly
We went to see our neighbors
I wish you all would go home
I hope the meeting went well
I hope the meeting goes well
They all should go with you
The operation went smoothly
Rents will go up next month
I wonder where Tom has gone
Tom wants to go to Harvard
The mission went perfectly
Nobody knew where Tom went
I think Tom should go home
Things go wrong sometimes
Things are going smoothly
Rehearsals are going well
Nobody goes there anymore
Everything went very well
Nobody is going anywhere
I wish Tom would go home
Everything is going fine
The audience went crazy
Most of my pain is gone
I went to public school
Hemlines are going down
Tom insisted that I go
Sales were going great
Everyone is going home
Things are going well
The momentum was gone
The meeting went well
Everything went quiet
Everyone must go home
Everybody wants to go
Tom went on vacation
Tom went into hiding
Everything went dark
Everyone may go home
We should go skiing
Tom is gone forever
The romance is gone
Please just go away
Go see for yourself
Everything was gone
They went shopping
Rents are going up
Everything must go
Your half is gone
We went to church
Tom went to sleep
I like going fast
I just kept going
Go home and relax
Everyone is going
We can go inside
Tom wanted to go
The pain is gone
Nobody went home
Tom needs to go
It was all gone
The government took our land
Tom is a graduate of Harvard
Tom is a Harvard graduate
All graduates are invited
Tom graduated last year
Not everybody graduates
Several grants are available
There are grants available
Tom grinned slyly
The ground started shaking
The ground is spongy
You should grow your own food
Our children are grown
Grow up a little
Tom has grown
I can guarantee it
Guard duty is boring
Be on your guard
I guess everyone was lying
My guess was right
Nobody handed Tom anything
Pull your hand out
Tom handled it perfectly
Tom handled that well
Tom will handle it
They can handle it
I can handle those
Tom and Mary hung out together
Tom was convicted and hanged
I hang out with Tom a lot
We hung in there
Tom then hung up
Everything happened so quickly
Maybe something else happened
Those things really happened
That happened just recently
Sometimes that just happens
I thought that might happen
Something bizarre happened
Nothing happens overnight
It never actually happened
I understand what happened
Everyone saw what happened
That has already happened
That happened to me twice
That happened decades ago
That almost never happens
Sometimes it just happens
It just happens sometimes
Good things are happening
Whatever happens happens
What happened was tragic
We know accidents happen
These things just happen
That has happened before
That happens to everyone
That happened in October
That happened a week ago
Nobody saw what happened
Tom makes things happen
These things can happen
That would never happen
That happened last week
It has already happened
It all happened quickly
They know what happens
That may happen Monday
That actually happened
Sometimes that happens
Now look what happened
Miracles have happened
Not too much happened
It might never happen
It has never happened
It happens frequently
This really happened
That happens in life
So much is happening
Nothing bad happened
Those things happen
This rarely happens
It may never happen
It can happen again
Tom made it happen
That happened here
It can happen here
I saw that happen
This will happen
It had to happen
Tom meant no harm
Not everyone hates Tom
Everyone else hates us
They hated being here
Tom hates that word
They hate our guts
I hated that movie
I hate my neighbor
Tom hates my guts
I hate that thing
Everyone hates me
Tom hates onions
I really hate it
I just hate them
I hate traveling
I hate that word
Everyone shook their heads
Some wounds never heal
We heard screaming outside
I heard three explosions
We heard three shots
Tom heard the scream
We heard gunshots
We heard screams
Crank up the heater
Tom helped raise Mary and John
Everybody needs help sometimes
This medicine seems to help
Everybody helped everybody
We need help immediately
Tom loved helping people
Those kids need our help
The medication helped me
I think experience helps
They offered to help us
Someone yelled for help
Somebody please help me
I told Tom to help Mary
Tom said he would help
Tom helped rescue Mary
This is very unhelpful
Tom will want to help
They have enough help
Nobody ever helped us
Maybe this would help
Let us help ourselves
I like helping people
We have offered help
Tom should help Mary
Tom really helped me

I needed some help
Every dollar helps
Tom helped us win
This app can help
That too may help
I hope this helps
Everyone can help
You can all help
Tom ran for help
Tom helped again
They needed help
I wanted to help
We like to help
This might help
Tom helps Mary
Tom tried to hide his pain
Tom hired Mary immediately
Tom hired an attorney
Thanks for hiring me
They should hire me
Both songs were big hits
Tom scored three hits
Tom kept hitting me
It suddenly hit me
Something hit me
I hope they throw Tom in jail
I hope Tom recovers quickly
I hope Tom will be on time
I hope everyone is happy
I hope everyone is safe
We certainly hope not
I hope everyone is OK
We have to have hope
I sincerely hope not
I certainly hope not
That sounds hopeful
Maybe there is hope
I suddenly had hope
I hope Tom survives
I never lost hope
I truly hope not
We all had hope
It was hopeless
I hope we win
I hope I win
I like hugging Tom
I hugged Tom
Several protesters were hurt
Thirteen people were hurt
Nobody was actually hurt
Tom really hurt himself
No passengers were hurt
Neither woman was hurt
Tom was hurt slightly
No officers were hurt
My legs are hurting
It hurt really bad
Tom never hurt me
It hurt me deeply
It hurts to move
Tom was hurting
Tom was my roommate in college
The doctor treated my shoulder
My whole family is from Boston

Tom sure impressed my parents
Tom and I have that in common
They both look the same to me
My favorite sport is baseball
I thought Tom lived in Boston
I just noticed something else
Tom took me out last weekend
The food is too spicy for me
Stop looking at me like that
Nothing surprises me anymore
Nothing interests me anymore
My watch has stopped working
I thought Tom was happy here
I think Tom is a likable guy

I made a sandwich for lunch
I just saw Tom in the lobby
I had pain all over my body
Everyone I know uses Google

That was my recommendation
That actually surprised me
Someone deleted my comment
My stepfather was diabetic
Let me pay for lunch today
I was really uncomfortable
I was kicked out of school
I was definitely surprised
I want some more ice cream
I tied everything together
I take full responsibility

Please respect my privacy
My cousins live in Boston
I think that Tom is crazy
I might have already paid
I love playing basketball
I live in a small village
I exacerbated the problem
I definitely recommend it
I can run faster than Tom
I am pleasantly surprised
Desserts are my specialty
Tom still has my bicycle
Tom and I train together
Tom and I are the oldest
That sounds racist to me
That seems logical to me
That really intrigues me

I listened to everybody
I invited Tom to dinner
I have dual citizenship
I have a silly question
I fully understand that

Tom mistook me for you
They took me seriously
These are my favorites
That was my motivation
That seems legit to me
That seems crazy to me

That seems fair to me
Sometimes I have pain
Nobody can replace me
I won the scholarship
I was very idealistic
I was truly impressed
I was pretty gullible

I definitely think so
I can understand this
Tom is staring at me
Tom is as tall as me
They wanted me there
That was naive of me
That just baffles me
Thank God I survived
Please send me money
People left me alone
Nobody recognizes me
My parents are great
My palms were sweaty
Let me rephrase that
I was very skeptical
I was very confident

My country needs me
Music is my passion

Baseball is my life
Tom stole my heart

Someone stole my dartboard
Keep him under watch
Consider it an emergency

This is my favorite book
Choice is a matter of taste
Poor as a church mouse
She was always optimistic
Prices raise from day to day
I am free this evening
The dog walks around the table
I missed you last night
We went to Sydney yesterday
This is my new news
The book is very interesting
Flowers grow in warm countries
I own all the books
We still have available rooms
I brush my teeth every day
Children should not be spoiled
Do not eat in class
Owls are cute
It seems to run in the family
Owls are active at night
Owls are wise
Owls have big eyes
I love her eyes
Practice is tough
Make it quick
You must tell me
He massaged her back
She massaged his back
I really miss my boyfriend
I really miss my girlfriend
I really miss my wife
I really miss my husband
He dumped me
I call her pretty often
Tom has left the door open
It will soon be dark
Opportunity waits for no one
I have met this girl before
He still has a white vest
She held a flower in her hand
I love to hate you
Muriel just turned twenty
I often play volleyball
I play a lot of volleyball
Please do not add comments
I am waiting for my friend
I will write to you next week
All I can do is wait
I only can wait
I am studying languages
We can go after the lunch
It was really cold on Tuesday
They suffer from muscle pains
They put up with muscle pain
Pay attention to what I say
My brother hates me
My sister hates me
He lifted his hat politely
The flag is raised
All will be well
All gods demand sacrifice
Bad gods want blood
I was shocked to see that
I was shocked to see it
Stop being such dolts
He was caught in an ambush
He kept reading the book
He kept on reading the book
The building is a hideous pile
Dad gave me a computer game
He sat down beside her
Please continue
Alice did not see the dog
He almost erupted in anger
You know what you have to do
You know what you must do
For this there are two reasons
The boys are thirsty
The difficult we do at once
The young guy wants to drink
No need to leave them
He likes adventures
She is selling a new hat
No one supported me
There is no breeze here
That would be disastrous
That would be disastrous
Tomorrow is not promised
I live in Osaka
Pain is not lessened by crying
Health is all I want
We spoke of several issues
We discussed different topics
We walk along the lakeside
That should be kept between us
You scared me there
Come in
He has no hat on
Please wash it
I think she is good at dancing

Urdu is her mother tongue
Urdu is his mother tongue
I gave my plans away

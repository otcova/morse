I met with Tom earlier today
I love Tom and I always will

He was adopted
This song is sad and beautiful
This song is beautiful and sad
It only happened a few times
Everyone does what he can

I wonder who wrote this note
I knew we were going to lose
I found this note on my door

The odour was disagreeable
They stop doing their homework
I said this a long time ago
I might never see you again
I have to do the best I can
I have some noisy neighbors

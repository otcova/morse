Tom finally broke the horse
The silence was deafening
The silence is oppressive
Tom fell into the same trap
The silence is killing me
The room has been trashed
Tom faces a challenging job
The results were stunning
Tom faces a burglary charge
The public will accept it
Tom expresses himself badly
The proposal was rejected
The prophecy is fulfilled
Tom enjoyed a glass of wine
The prognosis is alarming
The procedure is painless
The polar bears are dying
The people were screaming
The people deserve better
Tom does it faster than you
The park is closed Monday
The number was staggering
Tom directed the production
The money was never found
The mission is terminated
The message is very clear
The hiring freeze is over
The healing can now begin
The guilt is overwhelming
The goal is accessibility
The function was canceled
The flavor is sensational
The first claim is untrue
The election is on Monday
The door is slightly ajar
The dog continued to bark
The documentation is fine
The day started very well
The crowd was electrified
The crowd is appreciative
The cows graze peacefully
The climb took three days
The city is wasting money
The children went berserk
The cheers were deafening
The challenge is accepted
The bottom line is safety
Tom did very well at school
The borders remain closed
The body adapts to stress
Tom did not mince his words
The blast was very strong
The blankets were helpful
Tom developed tongue cancer
The backsliding has begun
The adjustment is painful
Tom denied molesting anyone
Tom cried as he walked home
Tom created a terrible fuss
Tom could make a difference
Tom could do the same thing
Tom cooked some fish for me
Tom constantly felt anxious
Tom certainly seems content
Tom caught hold of the rope
That would be unthinkable
That would be outstanding
That was really beautiful
That was pretty effective
That was my next question
That was far too dramatic
Tom can be abusive at times
That was an embarrassment
That was a rude awakening
Tom came here for the money
That was a big difference
That seems a little shaky
Tom called for an ambulance
That scar will never heal
That opportunity was lost
Tom calculated the expenses
That must be investigated
That looks really painful

That has really helped us
That counts for something

Thank you for not judging
Thank God everyone was OK

Take your trash elsewhere
Take care of your clothes

Take a chance on yourself

Support is very important
Sorry for the harsh words

Sometimes it really hurts
Something needs to change
Tom and I talk all the time
Something more was needed
Somebody dropped the ball
Tom and I speak quite a bit
Some people make me laugh
Some people are just dumb
Tom and I had only one date
Some people adjust easily

So give us your two cents
Tom almost forgot his money
Safety is the bottom line
Riots broke out in Boston
Tom agreed on one condition
Rain is needed everywhere
Put your hands on the car

Perhaps it can be avoided
People would be horrified
People should eat healthy
People need the money now
People love sports heroes
People are expecting more

The food disagreed with Tom
Our expectations are high
Our doors are always open

Our children deserve that
Our car is being repaired
One year later we married
Oil prices rose yesterday
Nothing was very specific
Nothing can bring me down
No one has been convicted
Mary was always a good girl
No more words were spoken
No date has been proposed
Neither of them had a job
Neighbors are still upset
Nearly three hours passed
My position is very clear
My mouth was suddenly dry
My mistake was responding
My husband is hardworking
My how times have changed
My friends were disgusted
My father passed recently
My eyesight must be going
My boys are my everything
Most people would survive
More regulation is needed
More charges are expected
Men will believe anything
Memories fade too quickly
Maybe you have bad breath
Many were killed that day
Many residents were angry
Make sure you start small
Little dogs are the worst
I wish I could see Tom play
I think Tom is already dead
Let the discussions begin
Let the controversy begin
Let me show you the truth
Let me go be with my wife
Let me add my perspective
I just want Tom to graduate
Kids make friends so fast
Just grab a seat anywhere
I just let Tom do his thing
Jealousy is an ugly beast
I hope they prove Tom wrong
I hope Tom can stick it out
I hope Tom can enlighten me
I have to tip my hat to Tom
I have no affection for Tom
I have many memories of Tom
I entrusted my money to Tom
It was very hard at first
It was really unfortunate
It was really informative
It was purely by accident
It was pretty unfortunate
It was pretty devastating
It was incredibly surreal
It was extremely grueling
It was clearly off limits
It was an unjust sentence
It was an incredible shot
It was an incredible game
It was all very traumatic
It was all very secretive
It was a wonderful finale
It was a volunteer effort
It was a remarkable sight
It was a remarkable scene
It was a perfect location
It was a little different
It was a difficult period
It was a difficult battle
It was a costly encounter
It really was spectacular
It really feels demeaning
It rained very hard today
It proved to be effective
It makes life interesting
It made little difference
It just takes one mistake
It just feels really good
It hurts like the dickens
It has been life changing
It has been an adjustment
It had the desired effect
It could not be otherwise
It could get embarrassing
It can get warm in Boston
It can be exhausting work

Tom voted for the proposal
I feel like I deserved it
Tom vehemently denied this
I feel all warm and fuzzy
Tom turned pale with anger
Tom turned around suddenly
Tom tried to run Mary over
Tom tried to manipulate me
I did that for many years
I decided to take control
Tom tried to do a backflip

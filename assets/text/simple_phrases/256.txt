I still need to get my bag
Tom was killed in battle
I want you to be a good boy
Think of the girls of India
She joined the Red Cross
Tom is a fervent churchgoer
It was bitterly cold
That was a wonderful success
Tom lost half of his family
I enlisted voluntarily
He looks just like you
Women are persons
Help us spy on you
Create Facebook accounts
Their job is done
Our house started to shake
I started sweating
She gave her son a big hug
Your car is a block away
The quiet cat caught the mouse
She was forced to give up
I saw the girl
I saw the man
Tom was coughing from smoke
Clean hands save lives
This area has been quarantined
Tom went completely insane
The evidence is questionable
My sister is by my side
It could have been anybody
Robin Hood robbed the rich
The prince wants a white horse
She flew home to Boston
He bugged her with questions
He dived
Water is life
She slowly opened her eyes
He is in great danger
She is in great danger
It leaves a lot to be desired
My office is in my apartment
I was diagnosed with pneumonia
I will give it to him tomorrow
I will give it to her tomorrow
The ship began to sink
I want Mary back in my life
This is a vital shipping line
You have to go to school
There is no time
It is cold out here
You went too far
Not going to happen
He pestered her with questions
He was wearing a tux
The photo shoot was fun
We have finished
She has a very welcoming smile
Tom has a very welcoming smile
He has a very welcoming smile
They agree with him
You agree with him
We agree with him
Mary agrees with him
She agrees with him
Tom agrees with him
He agrees with him
None of them knows French
I finished the job on my own
You will laugh
None of them is a driver
Unfortunately this is real
We have some questions for you
Let me laugh
There is no eternal love
I abstain from alcohol
He abstains from alcohol
Tom abstains from alcohol
Mary abstains from alcohol
We abstain from alcohol
They abstain from alcohol
Esperanto leads to friendship
Of course I understand
He lost the game
I want to eat a steak
I want to eat some steak
I want to eat something nice
I want something nice to eat
I want something good to eat
It takes all sorts
Out of the mouths of babes
From the mouths of babes
The meeting falls on a Friday
Fame is a magnifying glass
Tom is doing well on the farm
I need to think of my children
Give me the other one
I like to walk along the river
This guy is screaming at me
I bought these flowers for you
Marco bought his son a car
I was only joking
My plastic bottle broke
Fish wants to swim
My name is not really Tom
My name is not really Mary
Her pillow was wet with tears
It was a Saturday night
We must get there before him
We must get there before her
We must get there before them
This room has a balcony
I woke up in a cold sweat
My wife took me by the neck
I suggest you buy it
I think you should buy it
Maybe you should buy it
You should probably buy it
I even work on Sundays
I basically like your plan
Old customs keep disappearing
That shirt is inappropriate
The story gave me goosebumps
He passed by the house
Good
I have to get some food
My vacation was terrible
Try some of this cake
My real name is Mary
I should go back to work now
I should get back to work now
The snow is compacting
I need seventy meters of cable
The tunnel collapsed
Yep
The tunnel was declared safe
They have to work by night
This is not our planet
You already look like an alien
Monkeys are kept in cages
Only your frigging job matters
This is a war
You should be safe there
This is so wrong
Take me back to the office
You will never win
This guy wants to be the boss
This boy never lies
I can explain
Monsters
We need you to get better
She left without saying a word
It tastes great
You poor thing
Duty calls
Mary was sipping her margarita
Men wore hats back then
I could look at this for hours
Just sit back and watch
This is Brazilian lumber
My pants split
Think of the Egyptian pyramids
They promised
They made a promise
I gave it to him
I gave it to her
I told you this day would come
He sat with his eyes closed
Tom has more money than brains
She has more money than brains
We use our feet to walk
His music makes me dream
Her music makes me dream
Their music makes me dream
At least one of us is a man
He has a sharp mind
I want paper
Get away from the fire
Give Mary my love
I called you for help
I told the cops the same thing
Somebody burnt my treehouse
I want to be one of you
She decided to throw a party
The crane turns smoothly
That was a tragic plane crash
This truck is very noisy
Tom can testify to that
Tom is guilty of murder
Tom is not going to hurt me
Tom was a chain smoker
Wait a minute
We need several miles of cable
You must be a very violent guy
The plane landed safely
The plane began its descent
I was drinking tea all morning
The plane wandered off course
This shirt is filthy
Wash it after school
The giraffe has a long neck
I knew him
I knew her
Tom knew him
Tom knew her
Tom knew them
I knew them
They knew I knew
I just finished doing that
I just finished doing it
You need to be honest with us
I never went away from you
She always does
Just leave my house
Send her home
Your hair is different today
I was just trying to help you
I did it right
Stop pissing me off
Go next door
Go in the house
Go upstairs
Send him upstairs
Take her upstairs
I checked upstairs
Tom is coming upstairs
The art exhibition is upstairs
I am not feeling too well
It was a complete nightmare
She soon became pregnant
Tom finally got what he wanted
He never married
She likes miniskirts
It all happened very quickly
You will get what you deserve
He barely leaves the house
There are no fingerprints
This has to stop immediately
These ideas come from you
She always wore trendy clothes
I want bread
No harm could come of it
Experience brings wisdom
I program in PHP
Their ordeal is over
Tom arrived first
Her husband is my friend
I have nothing for you
We found them
We found her
We found him
Tom found her
I found them
We found them here
I just found them
Barbary lions are extinct
No one was killed in the fire
Stay home until six
Rags to riches
Get your paws off me
I like to listen to nasheeds
That was an unfortunate choice
Tom was abused as a child
This is a beaver dam
Have no fear
She was very afraid of him
Alcohol is the enemy
I just want us to be together
He looks thinner every day
I subscribed to a newspaper
I keep a diary
She was jealous
That will be done this week
I am telling you the truth
I know that you like coffee
I tell you the truth
My name is Hassan
I work nights
I work in the nighttime
The doctors examined the baby
The meeting was interrupted
Trust him
You are my stepson
I could see caimans everywhere
The plane ran off the runway
This car has a huge engine
Greece is bankrupt
He is wise in certain respects
Two spots were open
I promise to come back early
Dad built me a model of a ship
The cows grazed in the pasture
He left an umbrella in the bus
Her name was not known
I am the boss in my office
We were in very big trouble
We lost radio contact
I was stunned by what I saw
The plane began to descend
Everyone on board was safe
They must be removed
He is a joy to teach
I just want clarification
Pilot Tom Jackson took over
Milk is white even at night
I tried to act naturally
Try to act naturally
We all live in the same dorms
We all live in the same dorm
She knows us well
Enjoy the day
He left without telling us
The book is up there
You should use a deodorant
I will be happy
Martha loves you
They liked each other
He knows us well
I think you can prove it
I came here for you
I am an astrologer
Everyone was not happy
This is not a secret
I do not like you
Nothing is working
He has sat in prison
Give what you like
He writes often to his parents
We hugged Mary
You hugged Mary
I will hug them
You enjoyed it
It was enjoyed
Today we dance
They closed that school
I shall leave school
Start from here
Everything is in order
The reason is simple
Be natural
I have to hang up
I called my father back
He was on parole then
This is a high speed train
The train went off the rails
The storm is coming our way
Call the coast guard
I swam back to the boat
I jumped on the opportunity
The ship was on fire
They did it for the money
Our plane crashed into the sea
She would make a perfect wife
People began to fear the worst
Not everybody loved Tom
He is awake
Enjoy
She is taller than me
I do not work on Sunday
That is my house
They will kill me
Mosquitoes carry malaria
She sleeps with her boss
You are my guests
The towel on the left is yours
God is good all the time
Mary took her earrings off
The knife is very sharp
The knife is very sharp
There were too many of them
Both of us are from Germany
Your body image may decline
I went to the plaza last night
i went to the plaza last night
I am not well
He will be missed on the team
I have good credit
I need to fix my credit
Dreams never die
I have friends in London
Tom is helping her
Tom is helping him
Tom is working in the garden
You live in a nice place
This is our living room
The bedroom is upstairs
Come down for a minute
Kibbeh is of Arab origin
That fish pie is fast food
She leads me to the key
I dreamed of my native village
Tom drugged Mary with LSD
Tom wanted to test Mary
Tom claimed to be a murderer
Tom took Mary into the house
Tom was banished from the town
Tom joined a local militia
The genie granted Tom his wish
I get hot
You gotta play till you win
I did not hear you
Tom awoke from a lengthy coma
The epidemic spread worldwide
Tom was badly bitten by a dog
Tom played Mary a love song
Tom likes to climb trees
No one can do it
Tom said that Mary went mad
Tom ran back to the bunker
Tom was once again comatose
They sometimes help us
Tom knocked Mary unconscious
Tom locked Mary in a closet
Tom laughed mockingly at Mary
Tom begged Mary for help
Tom asked Mary to help
Tom grabbed Mary by the neck
I wrote you a letter

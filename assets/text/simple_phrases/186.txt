Someone swept the pantry
Call us when you get there
Come as you are
Get in the car
Go back to bed
Go get changed
Have some coffee

We should do this again
We were just going
Take your time
You have a pretty good memory
My parents left the church

I asked Tom
Your dinner is getting cold
You made it possible
You can tell me anything
We were too late
We succeeded
We made it
This story is too predictable
This is incredible
There is no one there
There is a full moon tonight
The sun has set
The road was very bumpy
The food is spoiled
That was so cool
That was great
That was amazing
That took guts
That is all
Tell me about your wife

See you later
Parties are fun
Nobody knows
My eyes are burning
Mary likes you
Make the new guy do it
Lower your voice
It was superb
It smells bad
I wonder what that means
I was just looking around
I want you to let me go
I want you to come right over
I want to fight
I think we need more time
I think we need more food
I think we need more coffee

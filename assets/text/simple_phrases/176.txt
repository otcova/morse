He got the job
You are the devil incarnate
I thought you should know
Thinking hurts
Next time I will do it myself
Your ad could be here
I have many photos
He is too fat to run quickly
He did that for his sister
I scoffed it dry
He did it for his sister
She did that for her sister
She made it for her sister
They never give up
Your journey starts here
Let me know
Animals invaded the houses
His voice is that of a god
So I was right
You broke my nose
A friend just bought one
You are a woman
I like sweets
He just came back home now
I did not see the sign
Music has no age
I warn you
Everyone dies
I went to bed after eating
We must sleep outside today
This is a rental car
Nothing is impossible for God
They had a fight over one euro
You must wash your body
Bring me this
I explained him the procedures
This peach is a work of art
The sewage pipe is obstructed
Illusions are short lived
My name is Dorje
I had a lochia
I have to buy some swarfs
This is a swarf
I got a chip in my eye
You crack me up
I wimped out
The climb was worth it
Never forget it
They make toys in that fabric
I will not sell my soul
This heat is unbearable
His words are confusing
Her texts are concise
He came back at five
You can go home
You can come home
Sometimes I still miss her
I hope I can see you soon
It might rain
Have some coffee
None of them are drivers
Neither of them are drivers
Children love to sing
I still want to go
He died last night
I want to know where she went
He put away his toys
I married eight years ago
I think exams ruin education
We swam by the lake
You made a mistake
I need a new computer
Take it slowly
I love American food
He pretends to be gay
My mother prepares my meals
My mother cooks for me
This rule has no exceptions
I had a terrible experience
He had a terrible experience
Please ask someone else
Take away
Put it on
The clients decided
Italy lacks of leaders
Hummers are big gas guzzlers
He got the job by a fluke
So I boosted a couple of CDs
I am thankful for veterans
We are seven billion now
Long reign our king
There are no gods
I like to listen to music
People learn from me
I am aware this is Thursday
Midterm exams start next week
I was sure to find you here
I finally bought the toy
I want to know who called
I will play football tomorrow
I will play soccer tomorrow
I go to school every day
It snows outside
I like this saying
The bus was full
Good always wins over evil
You are a panda
I am thankful for rain
Eat anything you like
Excuse me
She likes to sing
Perish the thought
It was too late
I moved here yesterday
Fear prevails
Seems I have fever
It seems I have fever
Jiro is not here
You will be even better
I doubt his words
That joke was about me
There is a new survey
Someone has to stop it
He has a heart of stone
The answer is right
I want to be a goat
Actually she is a loose woman
He made me smile
She made me smile
It made me smile
I am thankful for sunshine
May contain nuts
I was waiting for you
We can only become what we are
Only humans can laugh
Give it to me
Those shoes were made in Italy
This is a true story
The vote is unanimous
It will be delivered next week
The camel is still on its way
A widow had two daughters
Individuals invent
Eat noodles
Everyone likes big pizzas
That red car hit the blue van
His father is a physicist
That man is a criminal
That man is a criminologist
The French are our friends
Read and reply
You ran back here
You may go in now
No one answered my question
Tom is as thick as a plank
That should be enough
So much for our nobility then
I hope that you are very well
Now it is official
Nothing is happening
The cow is a symbol of Europe
Bring me a drink
I need a drink
You are embarrassing
Over and out
I got his album yesterday
Today is a fabulous day
Our apple is pathetic
This one is for us
I laughed
I was laughing
She rarely talked to anybody
We sacrifice a lot
We sacrificed a lot
It was a dark room in an attic
She was alone
That was her
That was her
We are at school together
The tall man left in a hurry
I am tired like a dormouse
Those eyes say everything
He was born in this very room
Yuriko Himekusa killed herself
This year is twenty eleven
I have fifteen hundred cows
I am thankful for vacations
Life is full of surprises
It is not funny at all
A contains B and B includes A
He was killed by my hand
He works as a busboy
Go have some fun
The soldier has died for you
Sweet princess
His heart beated slowly
It is I
The news was not confirmed
Poor cat
I hope you had a good time
This is a very scary moment
He showed a lot of skill
That has fallen out of style
I know this woman
I love playing my guitar
Good friends
It is so early
He died five years ago
Always keep the faith
An expert is speaking
A crocodile has eaten Tom
Those are gifts
A thought occurred to me
Crocodiles have sharp teeth
I like Chinese food a lot
Making cookies takes time
Tom ate a crocodile
Your sacrifice was not in vain
Dinner was awesome
A crocodile ate Thomas
Paulina has a pink cap
This is my school
I am as strong as you
You are fantastic
The river flows calmly
We are in Formigine
I want to go to the moon
Not as easy as I thought
They love each other deeply
I like that person
Speak a little louder
I cannot stand this noise
The snow melted in the sun
One must not abuse animals
Women are beautiful
Get on the horse
Everyone but Jim came
I let the cat in
They broke the silence
Ken has to run fast
Ken needs to run fast
I was applauding
Do whatever you like
I was there once
I lost everything
Any child knows that
Come and help me
Come and stretch me a hand
Stop touching me
He is hated by everyone
That noise woke me up
I said it was OK for him to go
I said he could go
She really wants to go
Please allow us to do the work
I use that computer
Everyone was satisfied
He walks fast
This could mean war
The case is closed
I am failing at cooking
You were right about this
My sheets piled up on my desk
He can say whatever he wants
She can say whatever she wants
They concluded he was lying
Allow me to replace it
He works at a pawn shop
I was told to get enough sleep
I was unable to go outside
What I do is my problem
I seldom see him
I hardly ever run into him
That young lady is a nurse
I have confidence in him
I trust him
My hobby is cooking
My hobby is reading
That house is for rent
He is hated
Either he is wrong or I am
I immediately built a fire
That one over there is Mercury
That one over there is Venus
Most guitars have six strings
We can make the world stop
I am too sexy for this world
She works as an ecdysiast
She works as a stripper
I am thankful for my family
Sophie had her own pony
The air is very humid
Death is imminent
I like that movie too
I hate hypocrisy
Do not disobey the rules
Leave my stuff alone
Leave my things alone
I need it immediately
He raised a question
He posed a problem
I ran for mayor
You seem to be a kind person
He seems to be a kind person
He left for Paris
My zoo is safe
An eagle flies in the sky
The father is a tailor
Try this miracle ointment
The socks and sneakers are new
I have no idea
I prefer antiquated models
I regret having to say this
I waited a while
He walked in front of me
I want a pen pal
It was as hard as rock
Tom loves to argue with people
I love watching birds
I am thankful for music
I feel lighter than air
You should not give up hope
It rang
Felicja likes to watch TV
My father has five siblings
The captain welcomed us
I hope he will wait for me
He is not religious
Playing basketball is fun
This tea smells nice
The economy is good
I want you to be my partner
Cut me some slack
I fully agree with his text
Luis Bonfa is a great musician
He often skips meetings
I wish you your happiness
The week is over
Bill is en route to New York
He likes to sing and dance
He likes to travel
I have eight siblings
Quit gambling
A fallen tree blocked the road
The train arrived in London
Evil always wins
His data is often inaccurate
Think about pay day
I am thankful for the holidays
I forgot about it
We know little of this matter
Mystery prevails
The girl talked to trees
Teeth whitening is expensive
Tom and Mary were not famous
The grass has to be blasted
I am thankful for technology
Tom turns thirteen today
The chair is too small
Look around
I have two big brothers
I prefer this version
I live in a giant bucket
Look what the cat dragged in
The police are protecting it
You have it in the bag
Weather is nice for you
I hug you
It has been wonderful
It has been very beautiful
I am in India
Those are all great ideas
Way to go
He receives a high salary
I want some paper
This is my room
She overslept
He rocks
His father is an impostor
She rocks
We are on the wrong track
I want to want
I wanna want
I adore my clients
He is chavvy
Throw the dice
He lost a book
She lost a book
They eat these things
My house is here
Be quiet
We suck
I like your techno dance moves
My grandmother lived with us
Goodbye
Turn your papers in
I like reading
I ran so I would be on time
I ran in order to be on time
My dream came true
Our dreams came true
We have enough water
He helped me move
That house is for sale
Everything has an end
I won an award as well
He looks happier this time
He helped me to get changed
A cat has two ears
One of the two has to go
Everything is so precious
You just made my weekend
The patient is unconscious
We have an agreement
That sounds scary
Soon it will be Christmas
I am not your love
I use Twitter
I forgot I owed you money
I got my notebook stolen
I feel like a million bucks
You are gorgeous
Chitin is a polysaccharide
Tom lost his spectacles
You look very beautiful
He was born an artist
He is a born artist
This land is your land
It looks so festive
She is in an awful mood
We used to be friends
That was fast
I work on a building site
She works as an office trainee
She goes to vocational school
Father is in the garden now
It was a cry of despair
Beatriz still loves Luis
I am indignant
I am outraged
I want snow
Have some ham
Our house is yours
I like the color violet
Me and him are friends
Your life is in my hands
The meeting ended
Animals have sharp teeth
Science is too hard
Jenny has a gun
That was an awful day
The hero became the villain
The floor tile split in four
Ethanol is an alcohol
I live in Tbilisi
You are pregnant
Today I am very tired
The lift is out of order
You are very sexy
No sooner said than done
Keri is a gifted painter
Shut up
Three meals a day
I have a terrible pain
My car is now being repaired
We have no extra money
I have asked him
I have almost no money now
The train leaves at six
We have a big dog
I wonder where Yoko has gone
You should exercise
You should get some exercise
I chose to look the other way
I admit that I was careless
He seldom went there
He rarely went there
He almost never went there
Stock prices fell quickly
Stock prices fell sharply
I confirm my presence
My brother will kill me
We work daily
We eat so that we may live
We eat so we may live
I wish I could dance every day
We heard this song before
We love going on picnics
What he said made us angry
What she said made him angry
I finally passed that test
I walk twenty miles a day
Neither can I explain it
I think she will come
She ordered three dinners
Little Sophie was not obedient
He passed the exam
She passed the exam
One vice leads to another
I slept very well last night
I slept soundly last night
Let me say this just once
My grandmother has become old
No one knows the reason
Nobody knows why
He sent me an urgent telegram
Walls have ears
I lost another chance
Our friend lost her mum
She bought a new car
You must bow to your seniors
Everyone loves puppets
Here is beer
I was gonna say a year
An emptiness devours my heart
The sun shone brightly
Turn him down once and for all
Be honest
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Fallen rocks blocked the way
Fallen rocks blocked the road
He finally achieved his goals
Please write down what he says
She cut her hand with a knife
She is really into knitting
Stay calm and do your best
Exercise outdoors
Eat meals slowly
He really makes me angry
They spent an uneasy night
Those shoes are old fashioned
We thought he was an American
Old people deserve respect
Her whole body hurt
We expect good results
Good results are expected
My ears hurt
Ants work hard all summer
She listens to religious music
I wrote her a letter every day
He admitted his defeat
He stuck with his own theory
I like seeing you glad
Incentives are always welcome
Incentives always help
He was too shy to do that
He proofread my manuscript
I lowered my meat consumption
He cannot be such a monster
That calls for a drink
Get out of the way
He smiles every time I see him
Save more
The cave is full of fireflies
It is written in Polish
He made up the history
I want to see your expression
I wanna see your expression
I used to dream of him
This is an illegal procedure
He never stays long
My mother is out there
I see smoke circles rising
Your asking this very question
I have a parrot in a cage
She just pulled your leg
Oh God
It was too difficult
Your nose is in my mouth
I want neither meat nor fish
How are you smiley
She likes humiliating people
I bought a book of jokes
I cannot solve this problem
This is a robbery
The entire world desires peace
Say well or be still
There is no other choice
I guess I miss you too
I like to be a redhead
This is the dilemma
I have seen loads of concerts
I think highly of your mother
These kids are always restless
People love to talk
I went to see a show today
I eat sauerkraut every morning
Tomorrow I will go again
It is time to get up

I had a good sleep till ten
I do not mince words
There were no more free seats
He needs a new knee
He has a white cat
We could live in peace here
I ate a nutritious breakfast
I had a healthy breakfast
I had him repair my watch
I had him fix my watch
People believe what they see
Dick got in a traffic accident
Dick was in a traffic accident
I want you to kiss me
I have a sore throat
I asked her for her address
We live near the large library
This chair is broken
He plays there
Play there
I thought it was a good topic
Dinner is almost ready
Follow that car
It was a church event
These things only happen to me
I was at home
I agreed with his plan
I showed my ticket at the door
I miss Italy
I want to watch television
Hick the woodcutter cuts wood
I want to go see the streets
Surely he is a sharp boy
I have some time
Let me pay

Everyone has their own style
They worked like bees
Transplants save lives

I leave life to join history
I leave life to enter history
Judy is a very clever student
He owns this land
Just seeing it made me nervous
Lisa has a grudge against Stan
He felled a tree in his garden
I think I should leave
Three times four is twelve
Eight plus two is ten
Ten minus two is eight
It was too expensive
We have no clue where he is
Everything must come to an end
I understand that
We should go inside the house
She treated his broken leg
This book is interesting
I want more of that
I went to school by train
I have a son and a daughter
I gave you my life
Now I offer you my death

People walk naturally
I hate exercising
I wish you a quick recovery
I suppose I could do that
He is young but clever
Most seagulls are carnivorous
Seagulls nest in colonies
This dog barks a lot
A cookie is under the table
No one is illegal
His ID was fake
She won the beauty contest
He has a phobia of Jaffa Cakes
We played better
Our progress was put in check
The woman hugged the baby
It is really cheap
No matter what happens
We live near the border
We have to do our best
We have no idea where he is
He was imprisoned
That was yesterday
She has a book
Anything is possible
Something is encompassing me
The fire started immediately
Tell me the whole story
I was bitterly disappointed
He is not here
She is not here
Yesterday I met Marie
There are no trails
There is no leitmotif
After a storm comes the calm
Be careful with what you drink
This was missing
You can use that phone
I have cabin fever
I demand that he be punished
I got a new cellphone
Children need to play
I do not feel like doing it
Everybody must know
The game lasted too much

The road is free
I never played golf

Happiness is a delicate flower

I would appreciate a reply
He loves going to the theater

I am a citizen of the world
It makes me feel better
It reminds me of my childhood

You recovered
It is said that he resurrected
They took it by force
We feared so

Just forget it
You can come

I hope you had a wonderful day
Forgive my laziness

He counts fast
I would like to kiss you

I own an electric guitar
Tell us something
We provide value for money
His handwriting is bad
That shirt is too large for me
I think shopping wins
Tell me about this girl
Tell me about this guy

Put your hands down
Because I speak Chinese

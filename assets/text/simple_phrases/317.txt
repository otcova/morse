It snows in Russia
These people are so peaceful
A bit
The guests agree
She liked this game
The suit fits well
She usually cycles to school
Because it exists
My best friend is a Russian
I will have to see a doctor
This suit does not fit me
Lift up your arms
Music is sound that thinks
My father is also a doctor
This coffee is very strong
She likes to watch television
It is what you think about it
Develop success from failures
It depends on inner conditions
So sue me
Captain on deck
Only the educated are free
Death hangs over thee
Adorn thyself with simplicity
Look within
Be one
The slippers are under the bed
They were tired
The birds outside are singing
She was one of the jinn

I like Germany

Stop staring
Mary wore a white miniskirt
She looked like a sad angel
There is a revolution coming
Tom was in his skivvies
Many are homeless
It is nuts
Tom was bedridden for a week
Mary was a timid child
Tom is a grizzled old man
And so it went on all the time
Life goes by really fast
No harm shall befall thee
Tom is a documentary maker
Give it to me
All this was done in a moment
A nymph lives there
Often she gathers flowers
Tom wrote a novel
Mary wrote a novel
Tom was in his undies
Tom consoled me
Tom could have followed me
Love your enemies
Mary has psychic powers
Thanks for watching
She is an Austrian
I loved Amaryllis
The referee stopped the fight
She is from Austria
Thus spoke the Methymnaeans
He was acting really weird
She was acting really weird
Mary wiped her eyes
She comes from Austria
He helped her dismount
She blushed like a schoolgirl
Tom blushed like a schoolgirl
Tom is graduating this year
Mary loves sports
He caught Mary staring at him
Tom caught Mary staring at him
She caught him staring at her
The Romans wore togas
Mary drives a minivan
Mary has a very good memory
This was the boast of Philetas
The glacier is melting
She was called Lycaenium
Daphnis has forgotten me
We changed our address
Daphnis has forgotten me
Today she is sick
Our train arrived late
Our plane arrived late
No one stayed long
Something bad is coming
I need it now
I study in Nijmegen
Think about her
Tom gave Mary a birthday gift
There is no printed version
I will delete my comment
He was mashing potatoes
I will die lonely
Look what you did to him
Look what you did to her
She glared at him
Mary laughed and hugged Kate
Tom looked around the forest
It feels like another planet
Mary wore an eyecatching dress
Your dress is beautiful
She kicked me out
He kicked me out
Tom was kicked out of the team
I did it to protect you
The light was green
Sirens blared
He asked her for her ID
This is a police investigation
Tom rolled his window down
The police are on their way
Tom was too stunned to react
He came to her rescue
Watch what you eat
Mary kissed Tom on his cheek
Work is more fun than fun
You are not at home
We are not at home
We were not at home
You should have come

Mary wants to die in her sleep
Put my car in the garage
She is married with a German
Tom drew the short straw
I hoped you would be here
It actually resembles a bit
We live in a remix culture
Come on Tuesday if you can
He will be very nice
His bag was very heavy
Your bag was very light
I noticed a peculiarity
You can keep the house
They were looking for trouble
He was looking for trouble
She was looking for trouble
Tom was looking for trouble
Mary and I are just friends
The company is growing fast
She was walking ahead
She is sure of her success
Put the lid down
He is sure of his success
Working here has its perks
I do find that unfortunate
This plan is sure to succeed
I had been framed
One gets forgetful with age
She gave a twirl
The audience clamors for more
This is a wug
These are two wugs
This research was a dead end
This happened recently
Beware of falling rocks
You must not falter
We cannot live without water
He twaddled all night
Water flows

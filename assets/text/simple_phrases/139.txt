One day I was lost in London
One day I visited my aunt
One day he killed himself
One day I met him
One day I found a box there
One winter morning I met him
I trust him to some extent
One morning he went for a walk
A man came to see me yesterday
A girl phoned me
An idea came to me

Try to see things as they are
All the money is lost

Alice has a flower on her head
Alice slid down the long slide
Alice hung her head in shame
Alice rushed into her room
Alice wears a sweet perfume
Alice smiled
Alice may possibly come
Alice went to bed at ten
The green color becomes Alice
We shot our wad
Thank you
Thanks
Thanks
I have more than enough time
Every insult was put on him
We tried all means possible
There is a limit to everything

What followed was still worse
Christmas is a week away
I will be free in ten minutes
I made an apple pie for you
I baked it for you
It happened in a flash
He disappeared in an instant
The bath water is too hot
Tom may have been sick
It must be Machiko
There goes the bell
There goes our bus
We can see Mt
Fuji over there
I will show you around
I found holes here and there
The sun was shining all around
All is quiet
There came a complete silence
You could hear a pin drop
There was complete silence
You could hear a pin drop
All around is silence
All was calm
There is nobody about
I saw nobody around
There were flowers all around
It is Eve that sets Adam on
I feel ill at ease with her
I know him
That building must be on fire
Look at those empty cans there
Turn at that corner there

There are many people in Asia
Come the day after tomorrow
He persisted in his opinion
You may as well give up
Stick with the job
Akira can play tennis well
Akira is a good tennis player
I dared to support his opinion
I burned my hand with an iron
The Irishman replies
Ireland is famous for lace
I have other plans on that day
They go everywhere together
There is no shortage of ideas
He shot at me
He shall die
I will give him trouble
He gives me chills
They passed out
They still seem like students
They are out of hand
Bastard hung up on me
He is really a perfect idiot
He is a daredevil
He is too dumb to fear danger
He is no better than a thief
He is a shame of the town
That fellow is a thorough fool
He was the cock of the walk
He is a formidable opponent
He is a spoiled child
Watch out for him
He is so heartless
He is a poet or something
He has a sharp tongue
He has a smooth tongue
He is nasty
He is a tough customer
He has more lives than a cat
He has an evil countenance
He should have worked harder
He is a hard boiled egg
He is busy loafing on the job
He is no ordinary man
He is very mercenary
That fellow is a cool hand
Ask him anything
That guy really burns me up
He is a good joker
His talk bores me to death
I gave him a stern talking to
I have to cover his loss
You can trust him with any job
I was deceived by him
I wonder where he is hiding
He lives a freewheeling life
He called me a stupid boy
He looks suspicious
He stole my purse from me
He hurled defiance at me
He buggered it up
That man is a wet blanket
He is buttering up to his boss
It is still as cold as ever
Now I remember
Archie made a move on her
The long rain makes me sick
Yes
She used to be a very shy girl
I wish I were a bird
I know the man
He cried how silly he had been
We are ruined
I sometimes see him on TV
Ah no
There goes a shooting star
My computer froze up again
A UFO is flying in the sky
I have a subscription to Time
I like science fiction better
OK
You can visit NHK any time
It is called a lily
You get on the JR Chuo Line
I can only import GIF files
Long on A and short on B
Draw a line from A to B
I will be back by nine
It is five minutes to nine
It is nine
Come to my house at eight
Get me up at eight

May comes after April
Four times five is twenty
You gave me only fifty cents
He must be over fifty
I am leaving at four
At four we could go home
Our rates increased in April
Four miles is a good distance
Forty years passed
He must be nearly forty
Forty miles is a good distance
Take three steps and jump
It rained three days on end
Please come in three days
He stayed there for three days
All three hated one another
There were three men
Three children sat on the sofa
I am the oldest of the three
Three people are still missing
We have French third period
Call her up at three
I can come at three
I threw up three times
It took half an hour
It leaves every thirty minutes
Count up to thirty
Two tears fell down her cheeks
Advance two steps
I have two dogs
Both dogs are asleep
It has snowed for two days
Never tell me a lie again
Not a few people have two cars
Both are alive
There were two women on board
Either of the two must go
They are both very excited
Two weeks went by
We start here in two hours
Two hours is too long to wait
I slept only two hours
We had a late lunch at two
Akagi from upstairs
Go upstairs and go to bed
Two pints are equal to a quart
Twice two is four
Two problems remained unsolved
Two pictures were doubled
Choose either one or the other
Twenty years is a long time
I have a few minutes to spare
He will be back in a few days
A dead leaf fell to the ground
A dog is running in the park
A cup of hot soup relaxed me
A year has twelve months
I was feeling blue all day
It has kept raining all day
He was playing tennis all day
We are gaining a day
I cover twenty miles a day
I go shopping every other day
An elephant was hunted there
Everybody fails once or twice
There is but one chance left
I must buy one
A car stopped at the entrance
A century is one hundred years
A man appeared at the door
All but one was present
An ugly man knocked on my door
I would like to travel alone
Get on the bus one by one
I plan to stay there a week
It had been snowing for a week
He got a hard box after a week
It kept on raining for a week
I can do it in a week
Take the medicine every hour
He left an hour ago
We will leave in an hour
He will be back in an hour
I will be back in an hour
I will come to you in an hour
I will call you in an hour
Put a word in parentheses
The first term starts in April
A bird flew into the tree
A bird was flying in the sky
A yard is equal to three feet
There is a page missing
I was fined a dollar
I found them all but one

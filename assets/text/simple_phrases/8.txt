We have to work harder
I have chosen it myself
You wash your apples
Nobody will want to talk to me
David went to buy some food
I want to go play in the river
There is no equality in nature
You must get out right away
The real work has just begun
Death is the great equalizer
The bar is on the ground floor
Death is the opium of losers
It cost us a lot
Nobody wants to talk about Tom
All you ever talk about is Tom
Throw out the boot
The apartment was broken into
Our apartment was broken into

Nobody else is in the mosque
Even beauty gets dull
The mosque was too quiet
The mosque was silent
Our imam is very old
Yanni called the imam
I need a new bedroom set
Yanni walked past the mosque
Nobody was in the mosque
We were in the capital
I thought you could use a hand
The mouse squeaked
My closet is quite small
She and her wife are coming
We sure could use one of those
My lifestyle is very demanding
Maybe I should call you

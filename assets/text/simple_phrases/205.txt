I stopped laughing
I want to be like her
I want to be like him
He stopped laughing
She stopped laughing
They stopped laughing
I just got my hair done
She braided my hair
I think it would be fun
She stole my candy
She stole my things
She wets her bed at night
He wets his bed
She went to Bible camp
He died in prison
The sky was blue
He put his arm around me
They ate marshmallows
We ate together
He put his arm around her
She brushed my hair
I brushed my hair
I brushed her hair
He refused to help me
She refused to help me
Stop gawking at him
I just want to disappear
I wanted to disappear
He was looking at you
She was looking at you
I think he was looking at you
I think she was looking at you
He was looking at her
She was looking at him
She sat back and watched
I thought it was cool
I thought it looked cool
She has hazel eyes
The squirrel ate the hazelnuts
I borrowed her hairbrush
She borrowed mine
We went out for some drinks
The sun is starting to go down
I flipped him the bird
I thanked her for her help
I thanked him for his help
That dictionary is mine
I want to go to class
I work with your friend
You are not an advocate
I see him
I see a harmful animal
The old woman exited the bus
He drinks beer
He sees our fruit
I will come in a few days
Anna likes chocolate
Linda likes chocolate
Ruben has three sons
Thomas does not eat fish
He does not run
He likes films
I am nothing without you
His mother writes letters
I was sleepy
I know Mark is sick
This pear is better than yours
He also speaks a little Greek
My right leg hurts
We are her sons
I do not like ice cream
It is a bell
She behaves in a childish way
That snake is poisonous
They hate laws
They hate the laws
You hate the rules
I hate the rules
I am not making them weak
I grew up in that neighborhood
He only speaks one language
Tom was crazy about Mary
I got a weird email
I will call you in a while
You can cry now
He patted her back
She patted her back
I gave him back his ring
So far he has admitted nothing
Music is not a language
Friends always find a solution
She identified him immediately
We had to check coats and hats
No one can foretell the future
It worked for me
She tried to console him
He tried to comfort her
I started to cry too
She wiped her tears away
He wiped her tears away
Tears rolled down her face
I need a Kleenex
She dried her eyes
She was sobbing
Her face was soaked with tears
He gripped her tightly
He hugged her tightly
She burst into sobs
She burst out crying
She sobbed heavily
She tried to hide her tears
I heard her sniffle
Just tell me
He took her in his arms
These are my briefs
He is going to read a book
I am going to leave tomorrow
We will not work tomorrow
This is my computer
She found an injured man
It might keep on raining
The sky was grey
The sky was red
She grew even more worried
I know what I will do
This is his horse
The man is a lawyer
The rainbow is colorful
There is no one in the house
There is someone in the house
Mr Nakamura is at home
The woman is a nurse
The mouse is under the floor
Analyn sold the cow
The wind is cool and fresh
We are three
You can do better than this
That was being talked about
Everybody thinks so
My house is really big
You are very kind to me
She is very angry with me
We are what we think
Now there is some left over
I am your fan
He had a dog
I want to watch you suffer
I want to watch him suffer
I want to watch her suffer
I am a Klingon warrior
Your speech suits the occasion
Thank God I am an atheist
Tom goes to school by foot
This is not acceptable
He walks like a duck
The lake freezes in winter
The book is on the desk
You told a lie
That is a lie
This is my doll
I use this desk
We made a banner
I live next to a dam
I live near a dam
A car has a steering wheel
The bread is brown
I am eating cereal
They kissed in the rain
She fell asleep in his arms
He stared into her eyes
Iodine is used to purify water
DDT is a famous carcinogen
I also love to cook
You and I will survive
Old MacDonald had a farm
We had a lot of fun together
Life is like a cockroach
He got his girlfriend pregnant
Her puppy is clean
Look at him
Please turn right
He paid with a credit card
The students are lazy
She ate nothing for lunch
I own a German car
I visit him often
Tom has put a cover on the pot
Read carefully the materials
Organize what you have found
Use a proper language
They have a good time
He works eight hours every day
He is in good health
I rather like him
Those two are pretty close
We used to be close friends
Any human can be a dead body
He is afraid of the dogs
My parents really love me
It went off smoothly

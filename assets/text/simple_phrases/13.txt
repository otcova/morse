Tom tried to fool me
Be careful next time
His voice is a bit raspy
His voice is a bit hoarse
The wet floor is very slippery
The water slid over the rocks
These two lines are divergent
I just took it
Last winter was really dry
It makes you feel better
It lifts your spirits
I hope the rain lasts forever
It rains almost every day
Tom eventually got used to it
Maybe I was too confident
This is lemon juice
Some days I have to go to work
We still work with Tom
I granted him a wish
My nose is an unruly sight
The orphan needs food
Bring the food
Tom collects shells
These are leather
These are made of leather
Those shoes look uncomfortable
I want them without shoelaces
Those heels are really high
I think it fits you well
Their nests are big and white
Discussions will be frequent
This is a banjo
The roads are empty
Tom hates peppers
These socks were left out
These socks were left outside
Hold it with those clothespins
Hold it with those prongs
Hold it with those tongs
My wallet is made of leather
I like its fragrance
It happens to the best of us
Life is what it is
This is driving me nuts
You have so much to learn
Squeeze my hand if you need to
Tom is a DJ at Ibiza
Tom was named after his dad
So much more than you think
Trump trumped himself
Spare me
Spare me your stories
Wait
Spare me your excuses
They messed up my picture
I think they do it on purpose
I see a monkey without a tail
Onesies are comfortable
Tom may not sell it to me
The convention was a disaster
I like to stay at home
I just talk to myself
That made Tom giggle
This one is worse
Neighbors help each other
There are insanely long lines
Everyone has gone mad
I play several instruments
Tom likes teaching French
What Tom said surprised Mary
I have too many tabs open
I stocked up on food
Maybe Tom can do this
We were pretty late
Tom had a hundred excuses
The milk is rancid
We came here with Tom
Let me look in the backpack
I drive the car
My father eats little fruit
I am not afraid of dogs at all
Tom managed to do it
I love everything here
The dog attacked Tom
This child can speak English
Time is short
Tom pretended not to hear
I want to buy a new home
This is essential
I gave Tom several comics
This rag is filthy
Tom has a screw loose
Fold the towel
Tom is a coppersmith
I hope you have a nice weekend
Tom was a good person
Nobody checked it
I still regret it
This is a hat
We need to make Tom do that
Tom cares a lot about you
I have no problem sleeping
Life is an exile
Your door was open
I warned everyone
Tom brought Mary
The rifle is loaded
Close the curtains
I recognize those people
Listen to what Tom says
That is not a sentence
This is engine oil
Tom tried very hard
I brought my tools
We want proof
Tom called three times
My hair is blond
Tom needs to come here
We had good mentors
I still have to tell Tom
I had a hole in my pocket
Tom muted his microphone
Women love flowers
Tom deceived us all
I bought almost everything
This is very acidic
Coffee has caffeine
I dress the way I want
Please hand me that pencil
Please hand me that pen
He asked me to do something
I like the smell of pizza
Tom scanned the horizon
This car is small
Tom had a fever last night
These are no better
I try to eat an apple a day
This soup is salty
Mom bought apples
Tom may not have time
This is chess
Tom was too insistent
I think Tom will like you
I had to use clamps
Beef is expensive
What we saw shocked us
Tom might say hello to us
I hate onion soup
This is clear
Tom has paid off his debts
I feel alone without Tom
I wanted you to see this
More time is needed
Leila lives in Yemen
That was an accident
Both Tom and I do this
Tom cleans the stable
All our money has been spent
Tom shot the deer
They blew up
They exploded
They got angry
I bought myself a laptop
I wonder what Tom is after
Recline
This is too radical
Dream
Tom rushed to his room
My phone is charging
Maybe Tom needs a doctor
I heard a rooster crow
Tom lived in downtown Boston
This is a picture of my wife
You need to wait for Tom
The safe is closed
My mom packed our suitcases
This is well water
It was arson
Go apologize to Tom now
I want to know who it was
This is unethical
Tom ate half of the apple
Cats like yarn
Tom may not believe you
We became comrades
The floor is wet
Tom shrugged again
Tom never beats me at chess
I can never beat Tom at tennis
I need both of those
I needed both of those
We ate for free
Tom was awarded a medal
I made inquiries about Tom
None of this is my fault
Tom eats an apple every day
This song is great
Tom plays drums
This is a big waste of time
That car is empty
I hope they have hot water
I saw you across the street
You caught my eye
God knows I tried
Tom left a note for you
I like you the way you are
Tom left you a note
Take out your notebook
I think I swallowed a fly
This is ineffective
Tom might have eaten it
You know what we want
Tom knows a lot about cloning
Give me back my eraser
Gimme back my eraser
My reign is supreme
Submit or else
That was weak
We like milk
I need to borrow some clothes
Try refreshing the tab
I had a nice day
This is a fan
Tom drives slower than I do
This is peach juice
I live solely on instant ramen
I live purely on instant ramen
I live on just instant ramen
I prefer raw almonds
They put a gag on Tom
This is a fox
That was a big waste of time
I go fishing almost every day
We showed Tom this before
Math is very hard
Call your mom
This is just a test
The internet is full of trolls
Everyone says that to you
It was windy two days ago
I used to eat pizza very often
Mum laid the table
He likes going for walks
He likes to go walking
Your knife is rusty
Come live with us
I keep losing all my things
I felt very bad
Mary is a very clever girl
I keep losing things
Bring us up to date
Tom lacked confidence
Today is my day off
Tom left on his bike
I like my almonds raw
I keep losing all my stuff
The man killed the woman
Not all music is like that
Tom eats lunch at noon
He unbuttoned my shirt
He was unbuckling my belt
He helped me tie my shoes
My dad helped with my tie
My mom kept fixing up my hair
He turned on the stove
Take off your hats
Tom has already read it
You should call Tom right away
Tom was ready to cry
He planted a kiss on his lips
Tom showed his ID
Go talk to Tom yourself
This is a cap
Tom was with me on Monday
My desk is a mess
This essay is full of mistakes
This is our station
Tom needs to come back
Maybe Tom will come back
Tom has a lot to lose
All babies are cute
I heard a door open
Lower the periscope
Tom did a lot for me
I think we can go now
Today we are closing earlier
Tom sent Mary messages
I never liked this photo
He leaned in to kiss him
He took her virginity
It made me nearly cum
I lost my virginity
I handed him a beer
He admitted to me he was gay
Shut up and listen to Tom
I still have his cum in my ass
The legends are wrong
Please show me this camera
They met on a regular basis
They met regularly
They stopped meeting regularly
I came hard
Tom gave Mary a bit of food
Go catch Tom
I need to do something now
I got up very early
You were not ill
This movie made her popular
I worry as much as you do
Tom will write a letter
No reason could convince him
The car was wrecked
Winter solstice is coming
Study as much as you want
Put on a bit more salt
Because I deserve it
I began drinking beer
I barely had any money
This salad could use some salt
She has a knack for math
The apple cake ran out
I need a dozen eggs
We must be firm
I wanted to say sorry
Tom drives slower than me
I never take this ring off
Turn the music off
Tom went to visit Mary
We leave at dawn
I hear you bought a laptop
The room was very dirty
Tom was discharged today
I lost my dictionary
I only shower with real men
You can still help Tom
Go lie down
I have no time for anything
Everybody knows it was Tom
I hope that Tom comes back
They ignore me
My brother was drinking juice
Tom may do this again
Tom was ready to kill Mary
I like to play video games
Tom reaped what he sowed
No one remembered Tom
Release the dogs
Tom was buried by avalanche
That might be a lie
Tom ran away from the cop
Let them pass
Tom and Mary both came inside
I was suspended
I got less than Tom did
Tom might be leaving soon
Tom looked at us blankly
I hate taking tests
You should call Tom tomorrow
There may be more
Tom has made a few mistakes
I obeyed reluctantly
Tom said we should stop
We want to watch these movies
I hesitated to call Tom
Tom can play concertina
Boomerangs are tricky to throw
This is my brother Tom
This is my sister Mary
This is my older brother Tom
My sister is in college
Tom broke a world record
Mary is a brunette
It took the world by storm
My phone is set to English
I barely escaped
I majored in Spanish
I took Korean in college
My Spanish is rusty
My Spanish is a bit rusty
This has too many carbs
Get away from it
I must be allergic
Sheep cheese is the best
I need to rest for a bit
His prognosis is grim
Playing is healthy
Her eyes are very small
She has very small eyes
It rained nonstop last night
We lived in a retreated house
Ptolemy was a Greek astronomer
Stop wasting time already
Bring me an iced coffee
Open the shutter
Take it in small doses
Tom said he did this
He left without paying
Maybe he has it
I lost my nerve
Everybody teased Tom
Almost everyone went
The flag waves on the flagpole
I get dizzy when I travel
I always fail
I always screw up
Preparing this is easy
Making this is easy
The hill gave us a good view
They felt uncomfortable
No one forced me to do it
No one was forcing me to do it
It has a broken leg
This is no time for regrets
This is no time to be sorry
The fair starts next week
You have to cook
I hope I get there on time
I think Tom will complain
He kept an eye on his comments
Tom quickened his pace
You have a big head
We used to trust Tom
Our car got stuck in the mud
Tom may do it for you
We buried it
Tom just left the room
I want to do my part
You started before Tom
It comes from the heart
We know your father
Tom took care of me
I have a daughter your age
I think yes
Tom has no classes tomorrow
I crashed into another car
The window needs to be closed
Please keep the windows closed
Tom looked pretty stupid
Tom has a limp handshake
I keep forgetting your name
Tom had plenty of time
She and I are friends
His wife is my friend
Tom may not want that
I was about to give up
I put my finger to my lips
Nobody likes this idea
Tom was kicked off the bus
That looks difficult
I clearly understood that
Tom has been mistreating me
Many people looked at Tom
I needed to do this
This is new to Tom
Tom likes to gossip
Do what Tom asks you to do
Tom stifled a sneeze
He went out and shut the door
I never take off this ring
I urgently need money
It looked like Tom knew Mary
I miss your kisses
He stood up and smiled at her
He had a bath and got dressed
Wash it yourself
It was glorious weather
It was marvellous weather
This meal is enough for two
He was born into a poor family
Come early tomorrow
Those socks pong
Those socks reek
I hope you get it
Do what you can to help Tom
He has a weird name
The exam is coming up
Learn this poem by heart
That book was really boring
Tom bought me some books
Tom bought some books for me
Tom gave some books to me
He was a simple man
This coat might suit you
The picnic has been postponed
No wonder no one likes you
No one makes these anymore
Wait here
Tom never brags
The novel made him famous
A lot of snow has fallen
I want to marry a native
Winter is over
I wonder why no one likes me
I wonder why nobody likes me
Tom wants to major in French
He rode off into the sun
We did do it
I have this song on repeat
A chilly autumn is on its way
I can call you later
Shut your cakehole
Shut your piehole
The tomcat was sunning himself
Tom stuttered as a child
Tom is a stutterer
Tom got a text from Mary
Bill Walton was a stutterer
People treat Tom unfairly
I have to eat something now
His report was accurate
Maybe Tom is just hungry
Tom went to music school
Tell me I was close
I was almost there
I had almost made it
I must be off now
My brothers are a handful
I got a little paranoid
Tom might not publish it
I rarely get up this early
I think I found it
Tom appears to be Canadian
Tom was still in danger
Call someone
I honestly think so
Tom was at home that night
Tom decided to try again
The rooster crowed
Tom will be out soon
I came here to go fishing
I wrote to Tom about this
Muhammad is our prophet
We got bored
Radical Islamism is a problem
We have to tell Tom about it
We get on pretty well
I can do paperwork
I sensed something was wrong
He was stark naked
He started fingering his hole
A sense of sheer excitement
My sexual fantasies
I should be able to fix this
Your dick smells bad
Go say goodbye to Tom
I did everything as agreed
Everything bad is equally bad
An old person died last week
I like my godfather
Tom enjoys riding horses
We will be living togeter
Nobody really cares
Tom may have to do it
Tom answered the call
I ordered what I wanted to eat
Eat nutritious food
Tom insulted the waitress
I have a blog
We may win
Tom was an amazing person
We should give Tom a call
That was a bad joke
Tom passionately hugged Mary
Nobody in my family smokes
I really like this shirt
Tom crawled towards me
I refer to you
I want a big chair
Please stay safe
Tom finished his speech
The movie was romantic
We need to weigh this
Tom took off his sneakers
I have to prepare for class
I adore the French language
It sounds very interesting
Tom texted me a lot
You slept all day yesterday
Tom is a fast typer
Tom is active on Tatoeba
My friend Rosie is a werewolf
Call me an idealist
Tom took off his trainers
Tom went into the cabin
I think I know your name
The queue was long
Tom turned off his flashlight
You know I had to do it
Be extremely careful
Tom was completely surprised
My friend is from the future
I really like your place
Give Tom a hat
We ran out of space
Go see how Tom is
Keep the kids busy
I have work to do tomorrow
Tom may not have eaten it
I had a very good day
No wonder Tom failed
Tom shot Mary with her own gun
We had a fight with Tom
I did everything I can
I listen to the French radio
Tom told me he did it
I moved back
Tom finished the cake
I put the key on the table
Tom has no sense of urgency
Tom might do this now
Tom has cold feet
Tom always gets his way
I almost dozed off
Tell Tom not to leave
I like boiled eggs
They told Tom to go away
Pour Tom some milk
Tom ran to his apartment
Tom kept his weapon ready
This seems wrong to me
Tom called us liars
I got into debt again
Tom should still be here
I work at the bus station
I think Tom is in shock
Tom sent money to Mary
I gave several comics to Tom
We often eat pizza
We are french
I listen to the french radio
Tom took it from me
Tom let us do that
We need more bandages
Tom works in a nursery
I decided not to go by car
Tom ran to get the doctor
I do love them
We never spoke to Tom
Tom took his sneakers off
I need three copies
Tom ran down the corridor
Tom lent me his new bike
I like silver cars
Tom lent his new bike to me
I love being home
Tom was a street kid
I was in a band
Tom claims that Mary has ESP
I did what was asked of me
Take me back to the summertime
Take me back
I want to go home
This time is mine
The leftovers went bad
People grow up too fast
Tom will never listen to you
But I want it more than him
Bathroom jokes
How mature
You need a warrant
Show me the warrant
Tom briefly studied law
Tom was filled with joy
This plan will work
You should practise patience
Tom went to a tailor
I had to call a taxi
We saw Tom doing it
Tom loves playing solitaire
The wood was silent
The woods were silent
There was silence in the woods
The forest was silent
He has a shedload of books
He has loads of books
He has piles of books
He has tons of books
I know a little about this
This may be iridium
Tom has a really cool car
I need to tell my family
He said his goodbyes and left
He said farewell and left
The parting was hard for him
Parting was hard for him
Close the window
The weather is wonderful
The weather is marvellous
The ferry has entered port
The ferry has come into port
The ferry came into port
Smoking is not permitted
The museum is interesting
She has stopped working
She stopped working
It can easily happen
It can happen easily
The scissors are blunt
They need to be sharpened
These scissors are blunt
They need sharpening
It was meant well
It was well intended
She looks pretty
Yesterday evening was nice
Last night was nice
The meeting was adjourned
His operation went well
It suddenly became dark
All of a sudden it got dark
All of a sudden it became dark
It got dark all of a sudden
Handball is a team sport
Put another jumper on
Slip another jumper on
Lie in the sun
He does drugs
Have a lie in the sun
Please sing something else
She does drugs
Tom gave Mary a bicycle
It worked at the third attempt
It worked at the third go
It smells of roses
I do care what you think
Lent begins on Ash Wednesday
They suffered a defeat
He lived in Italy for a while
It has helped
Noise is a big cause of stress
Certainly
He gave a fiery speech
The breakthrough has been made
Tom left with the loot
It sometimes helps
You send it
We often made fun of Tom
That was all that she could do
Tom came down to see me
People are afraid of going out
I got a nice letter
I once knew a man like you
This apple started to rot
I used to live someplace else
He founded this school
Rhinos can attack people
Come and see me sometime
The match went out
This passport has expired
I have no talent for chemistry
My water bottle is empty
I dream of a better future
Some drugs cause liver damage
Get up slowly
Tom might be overwhelmed
I have no money either
The answer puzzled Tom
His presence makes me nervous
Her presence makes me nervous
Last winter was mild
Tom turned on his headlight
What Tom said made Mary smile
Tom told Mary to start running
I thought it was your turn
Tom and I agreed to meet
I want more juice
I need a larger suitcase
Geese are birds
Tom ended up losing money
I have no opinion on this
I love singing and dancing
Go ask what Tom what he wants
Choose one option
Tom destroyed everything
I left right after you
Buy something to eat
I immediately regretted it
I ought to apologize to Tom
Tom had another accident
Tom hid behind the couch
I got tired of laughing
Tom ate a little
I need a few more minutes
No one met us
Tom closed his umbrella
The walls are thick
I feel sorry for everyone
He was getting a hard on
Tom slipped Mary some money
My cock is yours
Only yours
I get along with my boss
It requires a little practice
Tom goes to church by car
Spend time in nature
Get out of your comfort zone
Tom left on a bicycle
I am observing some changes
I demand justice
Wash behind your ears
I killed you
I felt uncomfortable there
This infuriated Tom
I pretended to cry
Three hours passed
Life is lethal
I am aware of the risks
I only have one
What Tom saw shocked him
Tom said that he saw something
Take my sweater
I almost died there
May this never happen to you
I decided to go by car
All eyes were on Tom
Children like to play outside
She has her own house
He worries about the result
Most shops are in this area
She pretended to enjoy it
Tom is asymptomatic
I wish I could meet Tom
Tom is procrastinating
I wish you were there
We met yesterday
Tom wanted to avoid being seen
I have to throw up
The calendar hangs on the wall
A black cat eats a white mouse
A dove symbolizes peace
Smoking is forbidden in here
Avoid taking unnecessary risks
Tom was quiet in class
You should go to bed now
She goes to the park
I was expecting you yesterday
Sign with a blue pen
He went down the stairs
I want to win the most
You had to see me
This table is here
Tom challenged the system
My son is a widower
The wagon is full of hay
I turn on the lamp
It required a special visa
Time changes everything
Sometimes I work holidays
Sometimes I work on holidays
We have two kidneys
I usually sleep eight hours
I forgot to put on my seatbelt
I forgot to buckle my seatbelt
He waited until the end
The shower is still occupied
Go check who it is
Say it however you want
The humid air makes me cough
They showed worry
Go see who it is
We had an accident
You get free lodging in prison
Tom likes Asian girls
I work more than you
I do what I enjoy
I had sushi every day in Tokyo
You confessed something to me
You admitted something to me
I almost fell for my own trap
He has amazing luck
Tom laughed involuntarily
Dance with whoever you want
I recognize that car
Tom writes me letters
I already know everything
Tom might not want dinner
Tom woke up very late
Everyone made fun of Tom
This will be done by tomorrow
Facts are facts
Tom may not want dinner
A lot of people came today
Tom will live here with us
I had noticed that
We must be patient
I already told you no
I already have other plans
We let Tom go
Only a fool would trust Mary
Go ahead without me
I have to see you again
The waves were huge
Go on ahead without me
Go ahead and eat without me
We almost got away
Tom will go for help
I think this should work
There it was
Give Tom some cookies
Let go now
Tom turned and walked out
Tom turned his headlight on
Tom turned his headlights on
Tom rushed to help
I bet I win
Please log back in
I think you should apply
Drink more fluids
Not many people like opera
Tom bought a new horse
Tom threw the bottle away
Everybody agreed with Tom
Now you can rest
Tom did me a favor
Tom may want you to do that
Tom might want you to do that
I miss you and I want you back
Be my queen
Be mine
Be my princess
My Berber class was cancelled
She has a twinkle in her eye
She has my hand in hers
Her eyes spoke to me
I want to know who he is
The lake froze over last night
I was freezing
Men love to brag
Tom stopped and looked up
I finally got it done
You overpaid
Time ran out
Tom asks stupid questions
I have to wash my car
Everybody made fun of Tom
We need translators
Tom turned off his headlight
I like this smell
Let your hair down
I miss you
I want you back
Tom still needs to rest
Tom left the closet door open
The priest has come
Tom was the one who called
Choose five learners now
Help Tom take off his coat
Try to allocate time well
Share the sweets
Please phone later
I felt cornered
That got dark really fast
This bolt broke
Keep your eyes on Tom
Tom lost his nerve
I went to medical school
Firefighters rescued Tom
This is where we watch TV
Hello
My name is Jabu
Tom kept hitting on me
Witnesses identified Tom
Yanni played a love song
Tom has a shrill voice
I bought everything
Yanni apologized to Skura
No one listened to Tom
Tom knocked me out
I have to leave for a while
We need flour and sugar
We never found Tom
Tom wants jelly beans
I lost the ball
No one could hear what he said
These children are obedient
Tom has never been a gambler
I wanted a glass of water
There are no seats left
Tom called me a thug
I have my own point of view
I think Tom will freak out
We are ordinary mortals
Tom ran after the boys
I did it to make you happy
The smell of smoke is stronger
Go and sit next to Tom
We hate golf
I need to call home
I have to ask you to leave
Tom welcomed us warmly
I asked Tom for water
It was my debut
Tom probably did it
This was a poem
They might need your help
He gave me a kiss on the mouth
Tom was found alive
Stay as far away as possible
We were overwhelmed
Tom has never been stingy

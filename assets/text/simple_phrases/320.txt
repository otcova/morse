I want you to do that tomorrow
I want to try to do that again
I want to speak to the manager
I want to learn how to do that
I want to go swimming with you
I want to get home before dark
I want to get better at French
I want to eat some pumpkin pie
I want to do everything myself
I want to buy a new smartphone
I want to become a voice actor
I walked three miles yesterday
I used to work in a restaurant
I used to come to Boston a lot
I try not to eat between meals
I try not to complain too much
I tried to make both ends meet
I think you should do that now
I think we should visit Boston
I think we should go to Boston
I think that I want to do that
I think doing that would be OK
I think I should buy a new car
I think I can probably do that
I think I can do that if I try
I taught French many years ago
I still have a house in Boston
I should never have to do that
I should leave before it rains
I should know better at my age
I should be allowed to do that
I realized what my mistake was
I parked the car in the garage
I never would agree to do that
I never wanted to be a teacher
I never do that in the morning
I need to speak to the manager
I need to lose a bit of weight
I need to learn how to do that
I need to know what to do next
I need to know the reasons why
I need to go do that right now
I need to get ready for school
I need to buy another computer
I may work in Boston next year
I may have to do that tomorrow
I may be in Boston next Monday
I looked back over my shoulder
I looked around the empty room
I know why you want to do that
I know why you need to do that
I know why you have to do that
I know where you hid the money
I know what those are used for
I know what I need to do today
I know what I have to do today
I know it was you who did that
I know how you feel about that
I know how to fly a helicopter
I know all about what happened
I know I want to do that today
I know I need to do that today
I know I have to do that today
I knew doing that would be fun
I knew I might need to do that
I knew I might have to do that
I keep making the same mistake
I hope to visit Boston someday
I hope to do that next weekend
I hope I can visit Boston soon
I hope I can go to Boston soon
I heard that you would do that
I have trouble speaking French
I have to go to band rehearsal
I have to go feed the chickens
I have to get my house painted
I had to be in Boston all week
I had no reason not to do that
I had no idea I was being rude
I guess I could try to do that
I found some money in the park
I forgot I promised to do that
I find doing that disagreeable
I felt betrayed and humiliated
I enjoyed myself at your party
I doubt that will happen today
I do that at least once a week
I discovered something amazing
I did that because I wanted to
I did that as often as I could
I could go home if I wanted to
I could get hurt if I did that
I can do that without any help
I can come to Boston next week
I can be in Boston next Monday
I brought you a glass of water
Hang your jacket in the closet
Doing that would make me happy
Doing that would be very scary
Doing that would be ridiculous
Doing that will be very tiring
Doing that was very innovative
Doing that is healthy exercise
Boston is a nice place to live
Boston is a good place to live
All of us want to visit Boston
All of us want to study French
All of us want to go to Boston
Your technique is interesting
Your room needs to be cleaned
Your predictions were correct
Your name was never mentioned
Your handshake is very strong
Your fingers are really short
Your French is almost perfect
Your French has gotten better
You suggested that we do that
You should do that more often
You should definitely do that
You should be able to do that
You seemed to want to do that
You seemed a little surprised
You seem unwilling to do that
You seem to know who did that
You seem full of energy today
You seem a little embarrassed
You really do need to do that
You really do have to do that
You offered to do that for us
You need to wait a bit longer
You need to do that right now
You need to do that carefully
You might die if you eat that
You may as well do that today
You look like you just got up
You look like you belong here
You look like a weight lifter
You look like a tired old man
You have to do that right now
You did that better this time
You agreed to help us do that
We were just about to do that
We should all be at the beach
We really should visit Boston
We never speak French anymore
We never go to Boston anymore
We need to hire three welders
We just did that this morning
We hope you visit Boston soon
We hope that you visit Boston
We have you to do that for us
We have plans to visit Boston
We have plans to go to Boston
We had enough time to do that
We divided the profit equally
We come to Boston once a week
We caught a lot of fish today
We can never be friends again
This umbrella looks like mine
This poem is easy to memorize
They live in different cities
They fought for their country
These lenses are scratchproof
The police said I was violent
The only organist here is you
The only Canadian here is you
The meeting is about to begin
Thanks for helping me do that
Please let me do that for you
Please do that very carefully
Please do that somewhere else
No one here tells me anything
No decision has been made yet
My truck is parked over there
My truck got stuck in the mud
My room is cleaner than yours
My parents fight all the time
My parents argue all the time
My parents are both Canadians
My name was third on the list
My name was first on the list
My mother is older than yours
My house is near where I work
My family is living in Boston
My expectations were too high
My approach will be different
My ancestors came from Europe
Let me tie your shoes for you
It would be unsafe to do that
It would be tiring to do that
It would be simple to do that
It would be better to do that
It was really muggy yesterday
It snowed every day last week
It should be cheap to do that
It rained every day last week
My savings will soon run out
I work as an ambulance driver
I wonder if I need to do that
I wish you would speak French
I wish I could do this better
I wish I could do that better
I was told to stay in my room
I was the last one to do that
I was in Boston two weeks ago
I was impressed by what I saw
I was going to do that myself
I was being forced to do that
I was allowed to speak French
I was advised to study French
I wanted to go to the library
I wanted to go back to school
I wanted to go back to Boston
I wanted to do that yesterday
I wanted to do that by myself
I want you to teach me French
I want to see you immediately
I want to play chess with you
I want to move back to Boston
I want to go hunting with you
I want to do that immediately
I want to do better next time

I thought you used to do that
I thought I needed to do that
I think it might rain tonight
I think I should visit Boston
I think I should study French
I think I should go to Boston
I think I may want to do that
I think Boston is a safe city
I suspected this would happen
I study French whenever I can
I still have a lot of bananas
I sometimes do that by myself
I should probably not do that
I should probably go home now
I should go ahead and do that
I should be there pretty soon
I should be getting paid more
I shot and killed both wolves
I seldom speak French anymore
I seldom go to Boston anymore
I see no need to study French
I see no need to go to Boston
I sat together at the counter
I said I was going to do that
I remember giving you the key
I really want to study French
I really want to go to Boston
I plan to come to Boston soon
I never wanted to get married
I never wanted this to happen
I never wanted that to happen
I needed to do that yesterday
I needed to do that by myself
I need to remember to do that
I need to make some decisions
I need to buy some blue paint
I need to buy another bicycle
I might not go shopping today
I may go to Boston next month
I made the same mistake again
I looked in my bag for my pen
I left my umbrella in the hall
I know why you went to Boston
I know why you had to do that
I know why I ought to do that
I know where you hide you key
I know what time you got home
I know three girls named Mary
I know that I want to do that
I know that I need to do that
I know that I have to do that

I have to take out the garbage
I have to remember to do that
I have to go to do that today

I have many questions for you
I had no idea I was too noisy
I got tired trying to do that
I got really tired doing that
I felt no pressure to do that
I expect you to do that today
I expect to be in Boston soon
I eat only what I want to eat
I do that at least once a day
I did that with three friends
I did that as soon as I could
I come to Boston twice a year
I can only do that on Mondays
I can leave if you want me to
I bought you something to eat
I baked a cake this afternoon
I always knew I could do that
I advise you to do that today
I actually did that yesterday
I actually did that by myself
Have you found a solution yet
Giving up is always an option
Everyone is watching football
Everyone in my family is rich
Doing that would be too risky
Doing that would be obnoxious
Doing that would be hilarious
Doing that should be possible
Doing that seems stupid to me
Doing that is relatively easy
Do that as quickly as you can
All our students study French
Yours seems better than mine
Your technique is impressive
Your stuff needs to be moved
Your speech was really funny
Your prediction was accurate
Your passport is in my purse
Your name is on the envelope
Your headlights are still on
Your arm had to be amputated
Your advice was very helpful
Your advice has been helpful
You still owe me some change
You should stay here with us
You should do that elsewhere
You seem to enjoy doing that
You seem hesitant to do that
You said I ought not do that
You said I needed to do that
You ought to stop doing that
You need to start doing that
You need to listen carefully
You need to do that tomorrow
You need to be more tolerant
You need a permit to do that
You must not do that anymore
You may need to study French
You look quite uncomfortable
You look quite sophisticated
You look like a friendly guy
You look kind of embarrassed
You just drank from my glass
You have to start doing that
You have to do that tomorrow
You encouraged us to do that
You do that faster than I do
You do that better than I do
You did that wrong last time
You did that right this time
You can leave if you want to
We were asked not to do that
We should visit Boston again
We should get out of the way
We should cancel the meeting
We often go there on Mondays
We need to know your opinion
We need to clean the kitchen
We need more time to do that
We have to do that right now
We had dinner on the veranda
We could do that if we tried
We can be in Boston all week
We both want to study French
We both have to study French
Wait until Monday to do that
This hole needs to be deeper
This book is too hard for me
They pay me a lot to do that
The team needs a new captain
The situation here is unique
The hall light is burned out
The economy is in good shape
The captain wants to see you
The airline lost my suitcase
That would change everything
Quit asking stupid questions

Please give me this and this
Please do that sometime soon

It would be smart to do that
It would be silly to do that
It would be scary to do that
It would be risky to do that
It would be cheap to do that
It was very cruel to do that
It should be safe to do that
I did that just yesterday

I wonder if I should do that
I wish we had visited Boston
I wish someone would do that
I wish I were back in Boston
I wish I had something to do

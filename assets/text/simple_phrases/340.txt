Just below that ridge
Park it here and follow me
Just now I realized something
Reach out if you need anything

It was practical at one time
Please fold your clothes

Protect me from myself
Guide me
He reached out to me
He never called back
This is my sanitorium
Wait for it
I met the man in my dream
The bed is whirling around
I crashed down the hill
He was loved by everyone
Let the dust settle
She may die
Everything is dust
I need an elixir
Try it on the other way
The world is limitless
Clear the decks
Everything down the drain
Bend the string
Add this to your stack
Select all contiguous sectors
Our team won again
Clear the field
Call back
Look forward
The fumes are getting me
I drove uptown
I like your haircut
Look at this window display
I lost my mitton
Hold onto the lamppost
My morning is clear
I was banned
There will be an extra charge
Take my hand and walk with me
Seal the vault
My blood is congealing
Lay low
The hour is now
Double up
Put it back on the shelf
My ribs are a bird cage
Desire is the nectar
Get into the raft
Untie me
Free your soul
I have high arches
Why is this so poetic
He eschews anything mainstream
Get back to the middle

I was smashed in the face
I put a cleat in his mouth
I put a cleat to him
He called me the same day

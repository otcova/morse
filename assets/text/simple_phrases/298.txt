This is a training camp
Mary batted her eyelashes
This is a piece of cake
This is a bit offensive
Many people denounced Tom
This is a bad precedent
This could be your year
This came as a surprise
This article was boring
This appears to be the plan
This a developing story
It was a big deal for Tom
Things started out fine
Things have changed now
In the end Tom was killed
They were true patriots
They were just gambling
They were fully clothed
They want us to find it
They want to get better
They mean business here
They love to intimidate
They kind of adopted me

The nation is polarized
The kid was pretty good
The idea seems dreadful
I could watch Tom all day
The format is different
The fire never went out
I agree entirely with Tom
The fire alarm went off
The facts are the facts
Even Tom admitted to this
The distance is too far
The demand was enormous
The demand is very real
The death rate was high
Call Tom for more details
The crowd was fantastic
The crew was supportive
The concept is the same
The colors are gorgeous
Allow me to introduce Tom
The children come first
The check never cleared
You drove Tom to suicide
The bus finally arrived
The big day has arrived
The answer should be no
We were able to save Tom
That would only be fair
That was a terrible day
That was a good meeting
We may see Tom win again
That show is ridiculous
That seems unlikely now
We had no answer for Tom
That seemed like a joke
That scares us to death
We get that you hate Tom
That really says it all
That may not apply here
We felt sympathy for Tom
That may need to change
That left an impression
That could change today
That could be the issue
That article is rubbish

No one will do anything
No one twisted your arm
No details were offered
Never approach a cougar

Neither bill became law
Tom will succeed in time
My thanks to all of you
My prayers are with you

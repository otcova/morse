Tom sneezed
Get to work
Talk to me
Ignore it
Go to bed
It hurts
That was no accident
Someone set the house on fire
Tom works for a large factory
The table fits here perfectly
The pigeon flew in the window
Tom stayed there for an hour
Tom is the third man in line
This suit fits you perfectly
That river floods every year
I represent an American firm
Fill up this pail with water
I said a very foolish thing
I do this for the fun of it
We live on the third floor
This truck has a flat tire
The birds are flying south
It was all over in a flash
Wait till I finish eating
Tom fell flat on his face
I voted for Tom last year
I have to watch my figure
Wait till they open fire
Tom traveled first class
They came in full force
That was foolish of Tom
I get paid on the first
Tom stepped on my foot
Tom is in his thirties
Line up in single file
Put it on the floor
Tom has flat feet
Fill up the ditch
My feet are sore
Sure honey
He complained to the chef
I squeezed his shoulders
He squeezed my shoulders
He squeezed her shoulders
Your gut looks like an egg
Failure is not an option
His shoes are often untied
We hoped for a miracle
They listened to smooth jazz
Just leave it on my desk
Drunk driving is a crime
She has a feel for music
The Loyalists fled to Canada
They were all over each other
He took out his knife
He works on Sundays
It turned out just right
He opened his own restaurant
Stop acting jealous
He lives in a dry country
He wanted to help his friends
She helped her friends
Help is on its way
He called me the following day
My name is Tom
I love hamburgers
You are the love of my life
I hope you understand that
I live in Bucharest
I love to read books
Just think about this
We talked about this
You like apples
We work in a factory
Turn on channel four
Just close your eyes and relax
Good
There you go
Keep it going
This is so embarrassing
I can eat
No
I have to eat
I have to drink
I need printer paper
I can live without water
I read a book
The roads are unclean
This is a long pencil
That is a long pencil
It is a long pencil
The new house is here
You sleep in my room
I ask you a question
I ask her a question
Emily asked a question
Emily read a book
Emily asked me a question
Emily ate an orange
Emily ate an apple
Emily read this book
No doctor can explain that
It is a beautiful city
The bill could be paid today
He has a blue bicycle
I returned from school
Nobody even noticed
She can swim
I bought her a beautiful dress
I drank the coffee
Emily can swim
This is a fowl
My pen is in my hand
This should not be allowed
I live in Qatar
Your wish is a command for me
I really miss you all
He retired at sixty
I love you the way you are
You forgot to close the door
Your phone is ringing
May our friendship be eternal
It brought a tear to my eye
The girls started fighting
The boys started fighting
Everyone started fighting
The lake is polluted
The river is also polluted
He never says hi to me
I felt very sleepy
I hear someone coming
He works on Wall Street
It makes me sick
This makes me sick
He was always hungry
It was a walk in the park
It was a piece of cake
She talked my ears off
Emily is writing a letter
Glad to meet you
Ricardo is my first name
I am listening to an old song
I sing a beautiful song
She made a macrame bracelet
The cold lasted three weeks
They made scoubidou bracelets
He swept her off her feet
It was an act of God
I must do my homework
You must do your homework
My ass is on the line
I eat a book
Her first answer was laudable
She tried to hide her anger
I could not walk
He has a platinum credit card
She has a gold credit card
He told me I was cute
I am so disappointed
My mom taught me how to cook
He is a jack of all trades
He failed miserably
Defeat him
I am handicapped

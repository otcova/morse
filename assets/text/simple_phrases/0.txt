He became rich
The slugger was easily put out
The strong winds were blowing
I had otitis media last year
Out of sight out of mind
The ball curved slightly
He is lively during recess
Too much rest is rust
We came in sight of the hill
Women will have the last word
Parliament has been dissolved
Hunger knows no law
You need not have woken me up
You like balls
Your dog has worms
Give him vitamins
I read about All Ball
I really enjoy the climate
The weather is fickle
You must feed the machine
The restaurant was a bummer
There is a cat under the desk
Joy was mingled with sorrow
Silence grows like cancer
Brevity is the soul of wit
Nurses attend to sick people
The band sprang to life
Pleasure is the source of pain
The pupils burst out laughing
Some were late
What marvelous weather
English is not easy for me
It is wrong to tell lies
It is going to rain
A heavy rain began to fall
It is seven in London now
The radio will not work
You are doing very well
Keep it up
You had better not go out now
It is time you went to bed
Turn off the radio
The bell has not rung yet
French is spoken in France
It is fun to play cards
Coffee finishes most dinners
The price is not reasonable
Chocolate tastes sweet
No gratuities accepted
A lot of fish perished
It is he
That is not altogether false
Off it went
That is surprising
That is not your knife
It needs exercise
The subject is closed
The cap is too small for me
The news came out of the blue
The chest is three feet wide
He speaks with a lisp
The rule should be revised
The picture was wonderful
The house stands among trees
The house is not occupied now
I found the film romantic
The apple tastes sweet
It is no good talking about it
Stop going there
Smith demanded payment
Mr Smith is drinking coffee
A Mr Jones has come to see you
This is the coffee
Sorry
I missed the train
This room is anything but warm
The soup tastes of garlic
This coffee is not hot enough
This coffee tastes burnt
Coffee ends a meal
The shoes are made of leather
Just give him the wallet
She took to drinking beer
You might have just forgotten
Dad bought me a camera
A rabbit has long ears
That tall man is Mr Smith
The house is very old
Come and write your name
I have a pain in the shoulder
You may go if you wish
A Mr Brown came this morning
We have less snow than usual
Sugar dissolves in hot coffee
The best of luck to you
Death is the great leveler
Speaking
My camera is a Nikon
My watch needs mending
My watch needs repairing
I rarely touch coffee
I saw her for the last time
I want some coffee badly
I have never been to Europe
I cannot follow your theory
I want him to go there
I will go to Tokyo tomorrow
He failed the exam
He failed to take the exam
The clock is striking four
He was sitting drinking wine
The leaves turn in autumn
Coffee comes after the meal
The baby ceased crying
I got soaked boating downriver
Certainly
Naturally
The Japanese yen appreciated
Japan is a rich country
Tell me how he smiled at you
He has a gift for music
His books are next to useless
His paper is superior to mine
He was sleeping on his face
He drank from the spring
He could not speak French well
He adores the movies
He is a great lover of music
He likes a walk
He gave me a ring at midnight
He is reserved by nature
He does run
He turned back halfway
He took his own medicine
He was tired from reading
He bathed and dressed
He was born to poor parents
He was busy making a telescope
They married on Christmas Eve
They are unlikely to marry
They lived a happy life
They got married recently
She was dismayed at the news
She supposed me to be a doctor
She got a beautiful dress on
She wanted to get a divorce
Father manages the store
My father is an expert surgeon
It is very hot at night
The famous pianist smiled
You cannot miss it
I am moving next month
I will be free next Saturday
Hope you had a good birthday
The train is in
Traffic accidents happen daily
I am Chinese
My sister is fond of music
I want to go to Tokyo
It snows
Mastering English is difficult
English is third period
Japanese eat three meals a day
I have always kept my promises
I will be there tomorrow
I met an American girl
He lives in a flat
There is a large supermarket
Please do not buy it
Please go to San Francisco
Reading books is my hobby
We mistook him for an American
I have a son and a daughter
This lawn mower runs on petrol
Klava envied Lyusya
I want to go to London
My suit is grey
The weather was magnificent
The beer is stale
Maybe some other time
I learnt it from him
It is midday
Fine
Give examples
We exercise
Father got laid off
They are in trouble
You love coffee
I am married to a Polish woman
Poland is a big country
You got here too early anyway
I wish I had married her
His injuries are all external
His smug behavior is offensive
His death made everyone sad
His house is near the river
His house is near a river
His house is by the river
His idea is better than yours
His paper is better than mine
His essay is better than mine
His wish was to go to America
There is one on the table
I will fight to the death
They all laughed at his error
My younger brother watches TV
The lake is full of fish
That is mine
I promised not to tell him
Every right comes with a duty
Stay here and wait for her
I have to tell him about it
This is where he used to work
Her mother became mad at us
A ball hit her right leg
The boss will be angry at me
I like sweets
They make toys in that factory
I said it was OK for him to go
They concluded he was lying
Either he is wrong or I am
He rocks
She rocks
We suck
Shut up
I think she will come
Her whole body hurt
You broke into my territory
Now I must shoot you
I asked her for her address
We took the first step
Now we just have to keep going
I do not feel like doing it
I love her so much I could die
I punched him in the chin
She knows what she wants
My car was stolen
Her son will succeed for sure
I have forgiven her already
Nothing disturbs her
They were unfair to him
Nobody messes with him
My sister works as a cashier
Take this to your toy box
There is nothing ready
You lie
You are good at listening
My kitty was run over
I met her one winter day
Here is one of my pictures
Buy two boxes of eggs
My uncle has a house in Italy
I think she is very attractive
That song haunted me for years
Today we know that is not true
You can trust him
My life is empty without him
We yelled at her to be careful
He is as fat as a bear
Meros is absolutely not a liar
Meros is definitely not a liar
Meros is certainly not a liar
I would ask him if I were you
I have been to Kyoto one time
I think you need to see him
I plan to have lunch with him
I thought that he was rich
I thought that he was honest
I thought he was honest
Her face suddenly turned red
I cannot stop the bleeding
I pretended to support him
I think he needs to go there
The train arrived bang on time
They have the horse
I am pleased to see you
That will be funny
The theater used to open early
German cars are among the best
Prices rise
The doctor pronounced him dead
Coffee is ready
The boy is afraid of the dark
I will do what I need to do
They are reading her book
That dress fit her perfectly
There are many parks in London
You have some mail
It seems to be a lynx
I woke up with this mark
I am Macedonian
And I saw none of them
It was night when he left
I slapped him
I will live in the city
I live in Moscow
I watch the BBC
I live in Turkey
There is a full moon tonight
I sure hope he passes the test
They are probably all dead now
Something must have gone wrong
Something is still not right
I only hope it is not too late
I have something I want to say
They smell original
Sit comfortably
This is Italy
She is teaching me
I should visit Kyoto
She has three children
Eat me
Deal with it

I have a couple of questions
I like music
Maybe not
Real life begins after coffee
She is a singer
I can speak a little
He is not married
Abrams barked
He has white teeth
Emily is afraid of heights
I thought Tom had gotten lost
Tom sings
He wanted to buy a book
The cricket is chirping softly
We learn by writing
I have not failed
The woman is eating bread
I will go there by plane
I will watch a documentary
This is a fish
Abrams intended to bark
Abrams intended Browne to bark
She works at the school
Tom drew the sword
Hand it to him
She can swim
I will come
He is a perfectionist
I still love him
Everyone knows Mr Hashimoto
I wrote a book about China
He forgot her name
I picked a daisy for her
Tell her which train to catch
She loves you very much
He loves you
She lied
That is a bus stop
I am as rich as he is
The tomcat basked in the sun
The tomcat sunned himself
All you have to do is write
A cool autumn is coming
He lost his sight
The night was long
She can predict the future
He can predict the future
He likes to sing
He likes singing
The police arrested two men
The police arrested four men
She fled the United States
He fled the United States
My husband is a senior citizen
Twitter suspended his account
Emily stole my heart
She is not beautiful
She is impatient
He is impatient
She accepted her offer
He accepted his offer
Mussolini was a dictator
Some of them are clever
She shot an arrow at the deer
She sends us flowers
He got his ears pierced
Echuk is looking for a job
Emily wrote the sentence
She was singing a song
I was glad to see her
Say what is in your heart
The ice caps are melting
She is at the office
Tobacco arrived
Ripe bananas are yellow
Her dress was cheap
Her dress was a cheap one
She was already pregnant
Tom has stomach cancer
The car is yellow
He is teaching me
This is an orange
He gave him the book
The kittens are rolling
Melanie likes eating pizza
His book is red
I have a Twitter account
He says appalling things
Mary resolved to quit smoking
I have not stolen it
I became frightened
The TV set worked all night
We are not rich
I applied for this job
This argument is unassailable
This argument is irrefutable
I go out to buy the newspaper
She gave me her hand
This is a real beehive
I think that is his trademark
They were fainting
You are sick and bedridden
You have joined the party
Animals run
I will not go by tomorrow
She arrived there before them
They fought back
We concentrated
They will vote
I do not plan their work
She is a brave woman
Be respectful to the elderly
I give you my word of honour
His death made me wonder
He looked wise
He wiped out the recording
I did it of my own free will
She has a small house
My headache has worn off
He came without warning us
I woke up to the danger
He was voted out
He paid me a visit
Those are his very words
You are the very person I need
She gave vent to her grief
It varies with the weather
His fears vanished
She reads a great deal
He likes me
I thank you for your kindness
He lies
She lies
She never stops reading
She has four of them
It skyrocketed
Man cannot live by bread alone
I get tired
Do not go near them
Tom is looking up at the sky
Tom is looking up into the sky
I spent my vacation in Tunisia
Mary went too far
Susie fell down
His wife gave birth to twins
That was a very good dinner
Good job
Super
These received no names
Everyone keeps on smiling
Please let me pass
I am getting bored
It can be used to feed cats
He is miles away
His ambition is to be first
You are on the air
They ate heartily
No one can get near the boss
We are nearing our goal
He was taken into custody
They came to blows
His nerve staggered me
I share your grief
His kindness is only a pose
I thought she was sick
Nobody likes attention whores
There is wax on the carpet
Nobody likes crybabies
I spilled coffee on my pants
He used saliva as lubricant
I love lentil soup
The leech sucked his blood
He has no moral values
She unbraided her hair
Water pipes are cylinders
He left me in the lurch
All of you are cretins
We ate swordfish
No man wants me
He broke my spirit
Murder is a monstrous act
I hope he croaks soon
He has a robotic voice
This candlestick is very heavy
A dire tragedy has befallen me
He has a mellifluous voice
He decided to become a monk
He put me in a good mood
He is my only passion in life
I am a duchess
I spread marmalade on my bread
The twelfth juror is missing
He is morose today
There was blood in the syringe
He fed the chickens millet
Beer contains hops
There are algae in the sea
It smells of salt and algae
Stop dramatizing
It will make a home there
He is a lieutenant
He entered the boutique
He stood me up
She stood me up
We discuss many things
She wishes to purchase a book
This one is a book about stars
Someone open the door
Her eyes are beautiful
Your face makes me punch you
I drink coffee in a cafe
I have drunk the wine
No one cared about you
I know how to do at least that
The motorcycles are very cheap
The engines are very cheap
Tom is docile
My life was shattered
I have a home in the mountains
He likes the music
We do not live in Boston
Tom wishes to speak with me
He is not a liar
I just vomited
I am eating the apple
I do not fancy his appearance
Tom is not young
This necklace is made of jade
There is no time for merriment
I saw a cocoon on the tree
This is a wig
His eyes are like sapphires
We are compatriots
Pugs are not cute
I like this book the least
I stepped in the sludge
Do not judge the ungodly
Leave that to God himself
He was my comrade in arms
She has pearly eyes
She has pearly teeth
The goats are in the pen
The sheep are in the pen
The pigs are not in the pen
The farmer entered the pigsty
The baby is stuck
I am from Skopje
He tore the dress to pieces
He tore the tent to pieces
Tom is a ruffian
Stop obsessing over that
Mary took her pistol and fired
He has a unibrow
Shave off your unibrow
He shooed the cat
Stop shooing the chickens
The organist was elderly
Stop vegetating on the couch
The horseman is headless
He outshouted his classmates
He bought the steelworks
A peacemaker was summoned
This sentence is a mess
The rain gauge is broken
The pluviometer is broken
The pluviograph is broken
There was no counterevidence
The hawthorn tree was tall
This picture was taken by him
My dog is shedding its coat
My cat is shedding hair
This is his car
He spat on the ground
Only yokels spit on the ground
Tom gave Mary what for
Mary terminated our friendship
Tom is a notary
Tom is a braggart
Mary is a braggart
This is a desert flower
Tom is a doofus
He dismembered the body
Our plan has gone askew
I am woebegone
My incompetence aggrieves me
My life is not milk and honey
This is a killing machine
Stop feeding me wormy fruit
The cherries are wormy
The apples are wormy
There is a pike in the pond
The storm raged for three days
He raged like a wild beast
I found Tom smoking a hookah
I want to smoke a hookah again
I minimized the window
He stood in awe before her
Mary is a formidable woman
Tom is a potter
Tom is a saddler
Tom is a pilgrim
Mary is acting wild
This is the zeroth law
Finish what you were saying
Finish frying the potatoes
Finish boiling the carrots
Finish baking the pie
Finish cutting the paper
Finish cleaning the windows
The road roller is noisy
This is a dream dictionary
Mary has no will power
Mary is wary of strangers
The sheep is dying of gid
Mary screwed me over
Both of her cheeks turned red
Her cheeks turned red
I stepped in the mud
We sold our souls for money
Your castle is under attack
Humans are sentient beings
The cheese is very stretchy
Tom is a turncoat
The website is lagging
The webpage has frozen
I walked into a mirror
I walked into a door
I walked into a wall
I never change my sleep cycle
The collar chafed her neck
My shoes are chafing my feet
Tom has no moral values
Mary is socially awkward
Finish reading the book
Finish digging the grave
Finish the song
Finish reading the novel
Mary bought a movie for later
This is an infantile game
This is a singable melody
I am watching television
This tooth is an incisor
This is a canine tooth
Australia is a puppet state
Tom is a gourmand
It is half past midnight
I figured it out
This is a glass mosaic
He pecked her on the lips
Tom has braided his beard
I am no longer sleepy
I am no longer hungry
You have a passing grade
I can recognise my own kind
Mary played hopscotch
Mary took an antiemetic
Mary took an emetic
Mary needs to be tranquilised
Muzzle it

Tom is Caucasian
Tom is wearing a wind jacket
Tom is a Turk
Mary is a Turk

Mary is Greek
Mary is scraping her heels
I am your mother
A cobra bit Tom
The sun sets
All share the blame
They have failed
They have gotten lazy
Tom tried to remain calm
They have already been alerted
Her mother started screaming
Her mother started shouting
Open your present now
You need to get your sleep
You had a close call
You nearly died
I need a hot meal
I am lots of fun
I also enjoy writing a lot
No more need be said
Everything looks great
No need to introduce yourself
You can blame that on me
They just want to sell papers
I was getting ahead of myself
She is definitely innocent
Our success is guaranteed
There are no two ways about it
Mary has been badly let down
No two are alike
We have to work at it
My things are all in a jumble
It is a ragbag of ideas
He is plainly wrong
You can tell a mile away
I have a fatigue problem
I have nowhere else to go
Act instead of talking
You just need to listen
I am indifferent to flattery
Mary is a very vengeful person
I am touched by your concern
They know they can count on me
English is my best subject
I cannot get enough of it
I hate to believe it
I may have to change tack
I have no remorse
I have no talent for politics
I am not made for politics
I have no interest in money
I have no problem making money
I am not at ease in a crowd
I am just checking the rooms
I got hit by a truck
I was stuck there for hours
I got held up at school
I was raised normally
My parents were decent
I was a little kid once too
I was bitten by a dragonfly
I was glad I could help
I got held up at the office
I was chosen to satisfy you
I was a student myself once
I was startled for a second
I went blind for a week
I got detained at the airport
We were young and carefree
We were just about to knock
We were with family that night
We were using it as a shelter
We were just having some tea
We were happy or so I thought
We sat down to have lunch
We were quite a crew back then
We were let into a club
I would react very badly
I take myself seriously
I am serious about music
He looks a bit fat
Do your own research
Only you can make me happy
I think you look sexy
You answer questions so well
I have finished showering
I need a laptop for school
I need a table for eight

I need medicine for my head
My head is heating up
Stay put until I need you
I need soldiers for a mission
I need my powers back now
I need the brutal honest truth
I want to know the whole truth
I need men of solid stature
I need my passport for travel
I need him alive and unharmed
I need a towel or something
I need that kind of insight
I need finality to my affairs
I need your dating advice
I need to hear from my family
I need news of my family
I need help untying this boat
I need tranquility when I read
I need quiet when I am reading

I am fixing a meal
He likes flamboyant clothes
This car is kind of flashy
The bird flew into the cage

For your eyes only
The door is heavy
Tom is from a foreign country
Unfortunately I am busy
The tickets are free of charge
Now I am full
Tom is a mathematical genius
Tom has gentle hands
It turned out she was dead
I just got back from Hawaii
Please get comfortable
I get off work around ten
Tom is a girly boy
I was stoned
That is one of my daily chores
That is one of my daily duties
I have never skipped a class
I love Bantu languages
I love Austronesian languages
I love Semitic languages
Yes indeed
You felt excluded
Swimming is a pastime for me
I write gibberish
I write nonsense
Made in China
Be present
He answered by smiling
There were many people there
I hope Tom will soon be better
I doubt that will happen today
We sat together at the counter
My sister has many friends
I always do this exercise
I wish I had waited
Sami really is a dumb bunny
He does such stupid things
Sami and Layla are newlyweds
This is beyond perfection
I almost never use Facebook
My birthday party was on fleek
Now is not the time to do that
That will never change
Tom is sniffing a lot today
He has probably caught a cold
They are three old men
I need to get to Australia
I thought I had lost my keys
It is obvious that is a lie
They say that drug is not safe

Now the report is perfect

I am Berber and I speak Berber
I watch TV every day
You are in danger
Throw it out
I would like a trial by combat

We are against that
I know what you want
Tom is in the room alone
I talk to him a lot
I talk to her a lot
I used to be a butcher
Tom manages a bar in Boston
I can feel you fade away
Tom quickly got off the bus
He has asthma
I asked about it again
I buried him
I buried her
They all were wrong
Some things just take time
We will help as much as we can
Everyone admires her
The magnolias bloomed
I argued with my sister
Be selective in your battles
This is not a bribe
They moved to the countryside
We need to flatten the curve
There are no people
Nobody is moving in
This is not voluntary
I am not kidding about this
Mary gave it a try
Tom and Mary gave it a try

Classes have moved online
That was too harsh of you
I can do this without any help
Creativity loves constraints
I hope they will join us
The benefits will be manifold
I found your name on my own
You can be both kind and firm
That was a brilliant deduction
I dare you to love
Today is sunny
There is cake in the kitchen
Once I thought I was wrong
Turns out I was mistaken
We will get through this
My mother feeds the dog
Aim high
We value quality
It was played
I need to return to my home
This board game is really fun
Tom stole
Tom is not English
She has the books
Good advice is hard to come by
I was only carrying out orders

Feel free to speak German
Tom understands it a bit
He slurped his wine
Ask people passing by
Let me pay my part of the bill
People danced in the street
This is a long letter
It lasted for three years
Someone asked about Boston
We rejected the demand
We still have a last chance
We still have one last chance
That girl drives me crazy
I say this is the truth
I swear that this is the truth
I know you very well
You have three unread messages

Tom spoke fluent French
Go to therapy
There is so much you can do
Build good habits
Change is difficult
Change takes a long time
Go to the gym
Avoid accusatory questions
Avoid provocative questions
I pick up Tom
Team up with Ziri
Long live Western Sahara
They laid out a new highway
Life is very expensive here
Life is expensive here
I really like fruit smoothies
My best friend is Filipino
That voice is inaudible
A sock is missing
Mary had a nose operation
I see a woman in the park
I am afraid it is a rejection
Tom was reprimanded
She made me laugh
We were there for good
We were in Iraq for good
I was a bean there for good
We have beans there for good
Fall is here
A smile lit up his face
A smile lit up her face
I meditate in the forest
Those boys run in the forest
Tom guzzled his beer
Tom drives a gas guzzler
Let me have a look round first
I left my homework at school
He missed him
Tom lives somewhere else
White won the game
We got there before Tom did
We got there before Tom
I need a screwdriver to fix it
Tom stole my shoe
Tom picks his nose
Tom ghosted me
My cough is acting up again
We write
Notify them immediately
Recon the surroundings
We have to accomplish this
You cannot escape this
You will not succeed
I brought you water
I love reptiles
We will reach our goal
It will get dark soon
It is autumn
Maybe we have to do it
I want to spend a lot less
I need a hose
Tom sleeps in the basement
Same
The only problem is the people
It was photoshopped
I must be getting fit
I want to be happy with my job
I always do what I want
The prognosis is mild
His condition is slight
Thank you for being quiet
Name every word
This rock is beautiful
Tell it to whoever you have to
Tell whoever you need to

Nobody is allowed to hurt Tom
The Golden Gate Bridge is iron
White says
We saved the girl from Tom
I walked the dog for Tom
I am glad to see her again
Tom will be a good leader
I put the circular in the post
I put the circular in the mail
Try not to attack Tom
Never say that to Tom again
Tom is being sarky
Our planet is sick
Our planet is ill
What you said is absurd
You should turn the light on
It was a gripping scene
You have to come again
I laughed loudly
She died instantly
Give me a bunch of parsley
I work on a collective farm
We all worked hard
Tom stole my nose
Tom seems to forget everything
I went to school in my pajamas
I missed lunch today
My life revolves around food
We need you
Tom pushed me into the nettles
All parabolas are similar
My wife smokes
Better red than dead
Someone stole my books
Your words touched my heart
This might be the way out
I need to try to apologize
Ziri is not that into Rima
I have a lot of fun with her
I know you ate my Chinese food
Wait there
Wine is good for your health
I need to buy a planner
My mom was a heroine
My mom was a hero
Get it through your head
I am seriously wounded
I will do it when Tom leaves
I like Tom more than you
You inspired me
Life was simpler back then
So true
Tom cannot enforce anything
Two people perished
Two people lost their lives
She wants a sip of champagne
It was a taste of freedom
This song is timeless
This song is a masterpiece
The slime is thick
Superman won every gold medal
They exchanged kisses and hugs
He gave her a nickname
You can tell me anything
A dead donkey fears no wolves
Tom fell ill again
Tom got sick again
Ask him to wait here
Ask her to wait here
It seems like rain is coming
Only you can help me
They are entirely unrelated
Most people are asleep
Tom got off to a good start
Tom made a good start
I could do with a hot drink
I can smell fried food
The date was brought forward
He ran quickly to the door
In a minute
She gave him a smile
Today is his day off
It was his day off yesterday
Yesterday was his day off
My French is ropey
I own your face
Tom is an ogre
An ogre tried to eat Tom
Look at what the Triforce says
The king sucks
Well done
Give yourself a star
Well done
Give yourself a cookie
Ask Tom to wait here for me
Ask Tom to wait here
Tom ate half as much as Mary
Tom ran twice as far as Mary

Cats are smaller than dogs
They like the song
The song is in Berber
Everyone is dancing
Everybody is dancing

We need you
I need more sleep
You speak French
I refuse to speak English
Mine are bigger than yours
Tom swallowed their lies
We are an independent nation

I believe you want to help
Tom was only too happy to help
Tom is ashamed to ask for help
Tom was anxious for help
The country needs your help
I need to enlist your help
My palms are damp
We hit a bump
Tom seems to be in a slump
We have an unscheduled stop
I just wanted to stop
I heard Tom gasp
Tom heard Mary gasp
I know where you ended up
Tom has been roughed up
Tom is all worked up
The crowd was worked up
I know where Tom is holed up
Tom seemed pretty messed up
I need you to back me up
Tom really cracks me up
It never really came up
Tom is standing up
I was just finishing up
I need to clear something up
I was just closing up
We better wash up
Tom was badly shook up
You guys should team up
Tom is pretty shaken up
I could tell something was up
Tom packed his things up
You screwed this up
Tom is pretty beat up
Tom made himself get up
I knew I was being set up
That about wraps it up
Tom got up
Someone told me to look you up
Tom set down his cup
Tom served in the Gulf War
My kid was in the car
I kept walking to the car
Tom leaped into the car
Tom walked away from his car
Let me whisper in your ear
Collect your gear
The rules are clear
Let me make one thing clear
The law is clear
That was last year
It gets better every year
Look at what we have so far
Tom was smoking a cigar
You must be quite a liar
You seem really familiar
That was pretty peculiar
Tom grabbed Mary by the collar
This is very irregular
Get rid of that stupid guitar
Just take a number
The mood is sober
I know about your cancer
Everything looks in order
Tom is completing your order
I gave you a direct order
Tom has been booked for murder
Tom went to prison for murder
I could use a beer
I could really go for a beer
Tom took a swig of beer
Let Tom buy the next beer
We hit a deer
I appreciate the offer
I have so much to offer
Tom is withdrawing his offer
Tom wants them to suffer
I know Tom made you suffer
Tom felt nothing except anger
These kids are in danger
My friends are in danger
Your lives are in danger
The entire city is in danger
Tom is currently in danger
Tom was exposed to danger
Your lives are in great danger
Tom is a complete stranger

Tom lost a finger
Tom held up one finger
Tom is my biological father
Tom embraced his father
You two were good together
Get your life together
Now pull yourself together
Tom and John moved in together
Tom clasped his hands together
Tom and Mary sat together
We dig each other
They whispered to each other
You smell just like my mother
I saw you and Tom earlier
The boat crashed into the pier
Tom is a successful banker
Tom is no investment banker
I knew you were a smuggler
I set a trap for the prowler
I never asked you to dinner
Tell me over dinner
We should get dinner
I think we have a winner
I have a prisoner
Tom is my dance partner
Tom glanced over the paper
Tom glanced at the paper
We need to dig deeper
Tom has got quite a temper

Catch you guys later

The walls are white plaster
My life is a disaster
This is a grave matter
You could do so much better

It will only get better
I can always make it better
Tom is a potential babysitter
The room gradually got hotter
Tom is the worst director ever
Tom is running a fever
Tom has left us forever
Tom is the fastest driver
We have to pull over
Tell me this is over
I guess this is over
This interview is over
Dinner is almost over
Keep under cover
Everyone ran for cover
Tom needs to recover
You already know the answer
Tom gave an evasive answer
I think I deserve an answer
Tom wants an answer
Tom put a CD in the CD player
Tom is a team player
My husband was a lawyer
You could be a great lawyer
Change is in the air
I just wanted some air
I have long blonde hair
Tom was slouched in a chair
Tom settled himself in a chair
Tom pulled up a chair
Tom pushed Mary into the chair
Tom slumped in his chair
Tom fidgeted in his chair
Tom collapsed into his chair
You have so much to live for
Tom has a lot to answer for
I regret my recent behavior
Tom was a sailor
It was an honor
Tom slipped out the side door
Tom nodded toward the door
Tom came through the door
Tom emerged from the door
Tom backed away from the door
I need you to open the door
Tom appeared at the door
Tom ducked out the door
Tom stumbled out the door
Tom opened the truck door
I awoke on the floor
Tom was on the floor
Get on the floor
Tom was knocked to the floor
Tom walked across the floor
You deserve to be supervisor
Blame your predecessor
Get me a defibrillator
Get me another doctor
Tom has a visitor
We were returning a favor
I do owe Tom a favor
Just do me one last favor
I have several ideas
Tom has the oddest ideas
Fruit gives me gas
Tom changed his tactics
We need to improve the odds
I finally beat the odds
We both have urgent needs
Tom ran out on me and my kids
Stop gossiping about my kids
Tom held out his hands
You have very steady hands
You and I need to be friends
You once said we were friends
You have things backwards
They were cowards
You sure have a way with words
Tom saw many familiar faces
Tom got down on his knees
Tom likes what he sees
There are no guarantees
Tom is rough around the edges
I was just doing the dishes
We have extra toothbrushes
Tom is in casual clothes
Tom is diligent in his studies
You have my deepest apologies
I offer my apologies
I need supplies
I need more supplies
I need some new supplies
I know all the theories
Hardly anyone even tries
Think of the possibilities
Tom slammed on his brakes
I know a million jokes
This is no time for jokes
Tom lighted his candles
The room was lit by candles
Let Tom fight his own battles
I fight my own battles
We were playing by the rules
Tom likes to play mind games
Quit playing games
I can name names
I need their names
Get with the times
Tom has done it enough times
Tom can be trying at times
I do pray sometimes
Fire up the engines
I feel it in my bones
Tell me what your father does
Tom looks like he always does
Tom used to shine my shoes
Now hurry up and get ready
Neither one of us rides horses
I take a few night courses
Tom neither reads nor writes
It saved our lives
Tom and I owe you our lives
Hold on for your lives
I appreciate your motives
We wish to improve ourselves
Tom began to remove his gloves
Shoot anything that moves
I paid my taxes
The time has come for goodbyes
Tom looked Mary in the eyes
Look at those legs
You have great legs
I can use all these things
You can still do those things
Perhaps you overthink things
You say the sweetest things
You revealed your feelings
I know about your feelings
I forgot how sensitive Tom is
You must tell me who it is
I can settle this
Get a load of this
You started all of this
Get a shot of this
Keep me out of this
I can get us out of this
You can get out of this
I hope we get away with this
Tom has had enough of all this
Sorry about all this
You know better than this
I have no choice in this
I have a lot riding on this
Put your finger on this
I need you on this
We can all do this
Tom is unable to do this
You forced me into this
I thought you were into this
I paid a fortune for this
You could go to jail for this
You have to get past this
I feel really good about this
I got a call about this
Tom walked in with snacks
Tom stopped dead in his tracks
I can barely use chopsticks
Tom peeled off his socks
Tom nodded his head in thanks
Tell Tom thanks but no thanks
I guess I should say thanks
I think my job stinks
I know how this looks
Feed him to the sharks
We have learned how it works
Tom showed his credentials
Tom is going to ace his finals
Tom is popular with the girls
Tom is not what he seems
Tell me your problems
We just had a few problems
I can barely move my arms
I have all your albums
Tom heard the drums
It happens when it happens
I know all the signs
They were cousins
We all earn our reputations
Stand by for instructions
We value your suggestions
Tom kindly answered questions
I have so many questions
I work afternoons
I have no weapons
Tom appeared on the steps
Tom dashed up the steps
Watch out for the steps
Tom put a finger to his lips
Tom licked his dry lips
I already talked to the cops
Tell it to the cops
Tom looked through the bars
They are all ears
Tom was almost in tears
Tom was close to tears
They were together three years
That could take years
It might take years
Tom is wise beyond his years
It may take many years
They were beggars
People die in wars
I need to crunch some numbers
I had my orders
I already have my orders
We would like some more beers
Tom drummed with his fingers
Tom glanced at the others
My sons are soldiers
They were contract killers
You took me to the cleaners
They were deserters
I just want answers
Tom charged down the stairs
They walked downstairs
Tom never even came upstairs
I need you upstairs
Tom does me a lot of favors
The decision must be yours
The decision is yours
The victory is yours
Tom set down his glass
Tom held out his glass
Tom toyed with his empty glass
They were sitting on the grass
This may be hopeless
You guys are really clueless
Tom was ruthless
It may be quite harmless
Tom is quite helpless
The floor is spotless
You look a mess
Text me the address
Tom began to undress
Tom is making real progress
You have to talk to the press
Tom is under a lot of stress
That was my second guess
That was my first guess
That was my guess
I need to meet your boss
Tom waived his rights
I know now there are no limits
I have my limits
Hold on to your pants
Pull up your pants
You have hidden talents
They both gave statements
I thought we had commitments
Tom dined with his parents
I inherited it from my parents
The rains came in torrents
I call the shots
Tom calls the shots
Tom seems out of sorts
I just ran some tests
We have a houseful of guests
No such person exists
Tom is sure to come to see us
Somebody got there before us
Tom was going to expose us
You may leave us
Tom is making money off us
It has to be one of us
They will punish all of us
Tom is going to kill all of us
Tom means a lot to all of us
There will be two of us
Tom is toying with us
Come and fight with us
Tom is gaining on us
One of them even spoke to us
Tom set up a meeting for us
Tom has done well for us
They left that for us
This is about us
I think they went without us
Tom is able to destroy us
I have to stay with the bus
Tom can barely focus
It looks hideous
Tom was amazingly courageous
I can be courteous
Tom was dubious
The room was fairly spacious
Tom became conscious
That should be obvious
It seemed fairly obvious
Tom will be getting anxious
Tom will be so jealous
Tom was incredulous
Tom seems to be dangerous
It was incredibly dangerous
The climb was strenuous
Outsiders make Tom nervous
I can cope with bad news
Tell me the news
Tom was crushed by the news
This is stunning news
I have marvelous news
Tom is boarding up the windows
Tom is luckier than he knows
All I need is three more days
Tom has been lying for days
It went on for days
Tom fumbled with his keys
They sent me three turkeys
Tom was sneered at
This is working great
The chicken was great
Saving lives feels great
It feels great
It feels pretty great
Tom smiled as he took his seat
Tom leaped from his seat
Tom hopped in the front seat
Tom is in the copilot seat
Tom hopped in the backseat
Tom is working up a sweat
Tom approved that
I guess I deserved that
You can work around that
Anyone could see that
I think we can manage that
I can arrange that
It was like that
I think Tom is like that
I bet you tell everyone that
I can appreciate that
I believe you believe that
Surely Tom is aware of that
You have no proof of that
I think I remember doing that
I hated myself for doing that
Stop playing with that
I can work with that
I was cool with that
I can feel that
I can prevent all that
Try telling Tom that
I really believe you mean that
It was more than that
Tom deserves more than that
Tom is smarter than that
You know me better than that
Tom knows better than that
I raised you better than that
I taught you better than that
You know better than that
I insist on that
Tom would do that
You should totally do that
Tom will never consent to that
I saw to that
I can top that
You can help stop that
I needed to hear that
I can answer that
Perhaps I can answer that
I never really cared for that
I could kick myself for that
I hated Tom for that
I can respect that
I totally get that
I think we can accept that
I thought we were past that
I must ask you to do just that
Tom is very excited about that
I feel horrible about that
Tom knew that
I should know that
You never heard me say that
You really are a spoiled brat
Tom and I made a pact
Tom is vital to our project
Have a little respect
Show a little respect
You already have my respect
We have an image to protect
They were very strict
Go with your instinct
You need to sell more product
Tom is just getting cold feet
Tom shifted his feet
Tom scrambled to his feet
Tom leaped to his feet
Tom got to his feet
I only wanted to forget
Tom says he drinks to forget
The floor is quiet
The house is very quiet
I chartered a jet
Tom removed his jacket
Tom searched in his pocket
Stock prices could skyrocket
Tom vomited into the bucket
I may do it yet
Tom was in on the theft
Tom nodded his head and left
Tom nodded and left
You have one move left
Tom is the only patient left
I get your drift
I must be getting soft
Let me get something straight
Tom expected more of a fight
Tom knows better than to fight
Tom switched off the light
Step into the light
Tom cried out with delight
I booked us an earlier flight
Tom has been at it all night
I had an awful night
Tom is flying in tonight
We need to get this one right
At least I got something right
It feels right
You have to do that just right
You gave me a fright
You gave me such a fright
Tom was out of sight
Tom came in sight
There was no hope in sight
Tom is nowhere in sight
The end is in sight
Tom will be killed on sight
Tom was still lost in thought
Tom is lost in thought
I think you liked it
I might have mentioned it
I can respect why you did it
Tom could hardly stand it
I said ignore it
Tom is starting to lose it
Tom said I might lose it
You can take it or leave it
I bet I can prove it
I told them to stuff it
I made sure of it
Tom was sure of it
I hated every minute of it
Make the most of it
Leave us out of it
Tom seems really out of it
Tom is still pretty out of it
I hated myself for thinking it
This is pretty much it
Tom was OK with it
Tom seems OK with it
I can live with it
You have to live with it
I had to go along with it
Luck has nothing to do with it
Do what you want with it
That could explain it
I give you my word on it
I thought Tom was in on it
You might want to get in on it
This should do it
I helped other people do it
I let Tom do it
You just have to want to do it
That should about do it
Tom beat you to it
I saw to it
Put your backs into it
We paid for it
I almost fell for it
You were so ready for it
That nails it
You were bad at it
I was good at it
Let me inspect it
We should never forget it
Everyone felt it
Just tell me how you want it
I assume you all read about it
Tom has never talked about it
I feel really good about it
Tom was very nice about it
I never stop thinking about it
We were very serious about it
Tom was a good sport about it
Tom said you knew about it
I can live without it
I need to hear you say it
That was worth the wait
I could hardly wait
We should be OK here for a bit
Just sit there for a bit
Tom is a creature of habit
Tom is asking for credit
I knew I could make it fit
I admire your grit
You can imagine how Tom felt
You can imagine how they felt
The rest was my fault
You made that difficult
This is a good result
I thought you were brilliant
Tom looked indignant
Tom seemed reluctant
You can think that if you want
Believe anything you want
They might have what you want
They might sell what you want
I can be exactly what you want
That was evident
Tom was a mental patient
Tom looked impatient
They became silent
They were silent
The crowd fell silent
Tom fell silent
Your paper was excellent
I could never be violent
Use your best judgment
I made an error in judgment
Tom will be out in a moment
Tom will join you in a moment
They chatted for a moment
Tom felt dazed for a moment
They were silent for a moment
It was an awkward moment
Tom is caught up in the moment
That was a beautiful moment
I came to get an appointment
Tom is a worthy opponent
Tom is way behind on his rent
Tom just want to be different
I feel different
It was totally different
Tom will never consent
Tom was content
You make a good point
Let me get to the point
Everybody has a breaking point
Tom was robbed at gunpoint
Tom is fast asleep on the cot
You gave as good as you got
Tom was getting hot
I gave it a shot
Take your best shot
That was a lucky shot
I move around a lot
That sounds like a lot
It could matter a lot
Tom began to shoot
I was arrested on the spot
Tom is in a tough spot
You have to follow your heart
You already did your part
That was the worst part
Tom woke with a start
I need a place to start
Go to yellow alert
I can make this very short
Tom took out his passport
It more than hurt
We have to move fast
I had to do something fast
Tom began to talk fast
I can only work so fast
Thanks for doing this so fast
I invited them to breakfast
You should make a toast
Tom is still the best
Tom was one of our best
Get it off your chest
I can be honest
Tom was completely honest
You need time to rest
I have one request
Tom clenched his fist
Tom is determined to resist
They were lost
Tom is as dumb as a post
Get back to your post
You were asleep at your post
I wanted to show you first
I had to earn your trust
Tom is all weirded out
The buyer backed out
I lucked out
They walked out
The militia were called out
Tom is pretty wiped out
They were all tired out
I need to find out
Tom knows this town inside out
They forced me out
Tom is creeping me out
This is really creeping me out
It creeps me out
The boys are out
Tom stretched himself out
We can talk this thing out
I saw Tom and Mary making out
I had some things to work out
I have some things to work out
I planned it all out
Tom is clearly worn out
Tom is forbidden to go out
I never go out
Tell us how it turns out
Thanks for pointing that out
Tom has already figured it out
Tom was checking you out
Let me show you the way out
We have enough to worry about
We were told to stay put
I could be next
I really liked you
I knew I recognized you
I came to find you
I bear no malice toward you
Maybe this will convince you
Boy am I glad to see you
I needed to see you
I have an offer to make you
I need men like you
I want to please you
This may surprise you
We can accommodate you
They sent me to save you
I choose to believe you
I can drive you
Tom was ashamed of you
That was really nice of you
Tom took good care of you
I have no memory of you
Thank you for being you
Tom has been misinforming you
I have so much to teach you
I could never compete with you
We sympathize with you
Tom was so flirting with you
Tom was toying with you
Tom is toying with you
I can mop the floor with you
I have to be honest with you
I suppose I should thank you
I have so much to tell you
I had to wait to tell you
I could kill you
Tom is prepared to kill you
I need one last favor from you
I have total confidence in you
Let me entertain you
The drinks are on you
I checked up on you
Tom really was horrible to you
See if this makes sense to you
Let me get back to you
I know how this looks to you
I just showed it to you
I was totally into you
I must help you
I had a meal prepared for you
I got it started for you
There was a place for you
That should be enough for you
I grabbed this for you
I can look into this for you
I had dinner ready for you
I could tutor you
I could see it was you
I almost shot you
I have no desire to hurt you
I was never worried about you
Not everything is about you
I feel the same way about you
I have so much to show you
I have to say I envy you
You nearly broke my jaw
Tom liked what he saw
I told you everything I knew
Tom bowed and withdrew
Tom crossed to the window
Tom went and shut the window
You were a no show
Keep your head low
Tom is an eccentric fellow
Leave this area now
Tom is confined to bed now
Tom is dead and buried now
You can get dressed now
I need to get started now
Tom is at peace now
We have a bit of time now
My computer works fine now
I get the picture now
It seems to be working now
I need your full attention now
You have to leave Boston now
I need to end this now
I insist that we do this now
Tom is calling the shots now
I can see that now
Tom is alright now
Nobody can keep us apart now
I could kill you now
You must realize that by now
Tom is a little creepy now
The path was narrow
Tom is sure to come tomorrow
Tom smokes three packs a day
Tom is packing up for the day
Tom had a real rough day
This is your special day
We had a slow day
Today must be your lucky day
We had a very busy day
Tom is going to die today
Tom is in high spirits today
I feel different today
I feel funny today
The organ started to play
Maybe we should pray
Tom began to pray
I have so much to say
You know what they say
We go back a long way
You and Tom go back a long way
I pay my own way
Thanks for coming all this way
I think they went this way
Pizza is on its way
It certainly looks that way
I prefer that it stay that way
Tom is kind of crazy that way
I had some cash stashed away
I have some cash stashed away
The laughter died away
Tom hurried away
Tom blushed and turned away
You take my breath away
Just let me walk away
I just want my past to go away
I can make this go away
I said step away
You seem a million miles away
You both need to get away
I just wanted to get away
You should be put away
This will blow you away
Tom made a clean getaway
Get on the freeway
They met each other halfway
Nice of you to drop by
Tom is afraid of intimacy
Tom is a stickler for accuracy
Tom had a family emergency
Tom is almost ready
Come in already
You have my attention already
Keep your gun handy
Tom has got nobody
I never murdered anybody
It could be anybody
Let me get you the key
Tom began to carve the turkey
Tom said this is up your alley
We can make some money
Tom made a bunch of money
Green is the color of money
I never needed that much money
We make great money
I could sure use that money
Not everything is about money
You never have any money
Tom is an excellent attorney
Tom is still pretty groggy
They were wealthy
You said you figured out why
Tom smiled affably
Tom smiled amiably
Tom cried uncontrollably
Tom smiled uncomfortably
Tom fidgeted uncomfortably
Tom is looking weak and wobbly
Tom is at the general assembly
Tom smiled humbly
Tom left the room hurriedly
Tom smiled halfheartedly
Tom sighed profoundly
Tom smiled awkwardly
Tom smiled inwardly
Tom applauded loudly
I think this will do nicely
It seemed likely
That would seem likely
It seems likely
Tom looked at them closely
Tom looked at Mary closely
Tom smiled politely
Tom grimaced bravely
Tom smiled bravely
Tom smiled appreciatively
Tom smiled briefly
Tom smiled admiringly
Tom looked at Mary inquiringly
Tom smiled approvingly
Tom smiled knowingly
This might get ugly
It might get ugly
This just got ugly
You said you wanted a family
Think about your family
Tom is supported by his family
Tom clenched his fists angrily
Tom looked at Mary uneasily
Tom smiled guiltily
Tom turned the page quickly
Tom got up quickly
Tom closed his eyes quickly
Tom looked at Mary quickly
Tom stared at Mary blankly
Tom was laughing hysterically
Tom smiled skeptically
Tom was put to death finally
It feels silly
I suppose it was a bit silly
Tom slept peacefully
Tom smiled hopefully
Tom smiled gratefully
Tom smiled thoughtfully
Tom smiled warmly
The door opened suddenly
Tom woke up quite suddenly
Tom could see it plainly
Tom sighed deeply
Tom looked at Mary sharply
I came in early
Tom smiled eagerly
Tom cried bitterly
Tom smiled helplessly
Tom slept restlessly
Tom watched curiously
Tom glanced at Mary curiously
Tom looked at Mary curiously
We waited anxiously
You do like living dangerously
Tom frowned nervously
Tom laughed quietly
Tom ate quietly
Tom came into the room quietly
Tom spoke very quietly
Tom went upstairs very quietly
Tom coughed softly
Tom cried softly
Tom grimaced slightly
Tom winced slightly
Tom blushed slightly
Tom flushed slightly

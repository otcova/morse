From the suburbs

Food will be ready soon
She is still in the kitchen

Stay in line
Go inside

Not one of them was there

I wonder why Tom is doing that
She was relaxed
I have to see this
I have to see this movie
He ran a hand through his hair
He ran a hand through her hair

I see nothing wrong with this
Thanks for the pizza

Tom has to do that now
I am going on
All racists are hypocrites
Tom wrote Mary a letter
Better dead than red
I met a new friend today
She plays the flute

That watch is very cool
You should leave immediately

They put Tom in jail

Hi girls
Hi
Returned the money to Maria

Sorry about yesterday

He took off his shirt
Look at my arm

The prince slew the dragon

Please take this away
Take anything you like
Take it apart if necessary
Tom and Mary hated one another

The dog chewed up my boot

She just came home today
This is called true love
I can only speak English
He came here a long time ago
Go directly to the airport
He rolled down his window

I fear that he may not fall
He just went talking on and on
I changed plans
He is looking for a good job
Say some sensible words
I study many languages
I need to study many languages
I study at a university

She gave us a dubious answer
Clean the barrel of this rifle
I will make a bargain with you

Please fill the bath half full
The bath is open on Saturdays
The fallen tree barred our way
This book was a great bargain
Tom bought a bar of chocolate
I have a wonderful plan
Your complaints upset me
Your complaints bore me
Everything looks blurry
She got a new pair of glasses
On your marks
This song makes me want to cry
We hung out in the coffee shop
I need mascara
My lips are dry
She has oily skin
I have a sensitive skin
They asked me to open the gate
He signed the petition
That would be silly

Musa is an interesting guy
Tom is an interesting guy
Tom is a pretty stupid guy
Dolkun is a handsome lad
This sofa is very comfortable
Tom is a handsome guy
I did not want to do that
I do not want anybody else
They were always playing
It was dead awkward
I read a synopsis of the film
They are against nuclear power
It was a daunting task
They must believe in something
The hen has eight chicks
The topic is happiness
The worst things never end
Rice does not like moisture
Be sure to store it well

He sidestepped the question
It was my decision
I like to study languages
Black clouds began to come up
Do this before anything else
I had never been there before
I want a room with two beds
I went to bed very late
The supplies began to run out
They begged us to help them
They will come before long

A thick fog blanketed the city

Please beat this carpet
There are bears in these woods
Tom became famous overnight
Tom must be punished
Tom will be here tomorrow
Try to be on time
We are your friends
We built a fire on the beach
I know what Tom is doing here
Perception is reality
We had a really fun time
He was eager to tie the knot
You are wrong there
Aluminum is a metal
I woke up early this morning
He never speaks to me
It was nice to do nothing
It may be
I saw it on TV
I got a good look
I hate her
I hate him
I saw it on Discovery Channel
I told you he was cute
Now is not the time
It was nice knowing you
All the energy was wasted
It changed my life
That sounds like a bad idea
She works as an au pair
I could have known
I never liked her
I only buy soft toilet paper
That boy runs too fast
The lawn is a complete mess
All is in the hands of man
Therefore wash them often
Come by often
He was wearing a mask
She fell asleep on the bus
They missed their stop
I felt sorry for him
I felt sorry for her
The train will arrive soon
Sometimes lies have nice legs
This is not so tragic
I do not interfere there
The room was empty
She took a cab
She ran up the stairs
I hope I am not disturbing you
I must do something
I need to wash my clothes
She was pregnant
We hugged each other
They made love to each other
They made love all night long
They made love wildly
They talked all night
She lay in his arms all night
He held her in his arms
She fell asleep crying
They stayed up until dawn
He pulled her into his arms
All my hope is gone
The fire burned our house
I admit that I killed him
I admit that I killed it
He is going to write a letter
His face was covered in blood
The building is blue
He tried to seduce me
I think it will be okay
I just got back from Europe
I just got back from Germany
Welcome to the USA
She paid nothing
I paid nothing
They swam with the dolphins
She lives with her boyfriend
You need to eat more
Your lips are blue
He needed five stitches
She needed five stitches
He broke both his legs
She broke both her arms
He jumped to his feet
He suffers from rickets
It will make you smile
We were just talking about him
This is not my book
The fork is small
He choked eating olives
She choked eating olives
They need to study
They need to work tomorrow
They need to get up early
This girl is my girlfriend
She had a crush on her teacher
I heard that Tom kissed Mary
Tom kissed Mary goodbye
My neck hurts
Here are their books
Tom did not lift his head
Tom did not raise his head
Tom gave a bitter laugh
Tom glanced away from her
Tom grimaced
Tom grunted
Tom had two choices
Tom held out a chair
Tom just let Mary get away
Tom let me go
Tom looked away from her
Tom looked truly upset
Tom never heard Mary coming
Tom only sat in the snow
Tom pulled his hand away
Tom pushed open the door
Tom ran up into the woods
Tom sighed heavily
Tom sounded disappointed
Tom stumbled after her
Tom takes care of himself
Tom took her hands in his
Tom turned back to Mary
Tom waggled his finger at Mary
Tom was groggy with sleep
Tom was knifed to death
Tom was never prosecuted
Tom was on the way
Tom was tired
Take it one step at a time
She helped us with pleasure
I read it in the newspaper
Another season is over
I bought it at a thrift shop
Men only think about one thing
I taught him to ride a bicycle
I taught her to ride a bicycle
The kilt is not a skirt
He lives like a monk
She read my mind
All the girls fancy him
This is the hard truth
She looks half her age
This love will never end
He cheated on my mother
That is so true
I never did it again
I knew what he said was true
My pastime is reading
Every person is different
She dyed her hair bright red
She dyed her hair pink
I hope everything went well
I think I made a mistake
Blood flowed from the wound
Button up your overcoat
My heart bleeds for you
Please pull down the blinds
That car is blocking traffic
The calf was born this morning
The hotel is by the sea
The rain caught me by surprise
They passed me by
This button has come off
This cut is bleeding a lot
Tom did that by himself
Tom passed by me
Tom was almost blind
We felt all caged in
We met by chance the other day
You said that an hour ago
I just talked with Tom
She has an interest in fashion
To go on
No
Crowds howling
From stone pain to plant pain
For everything is pain
Thinking of surprise
Tom looks cool
Mary looks hot
Conscience is sorrow
Intelligence is deception
Only on the outskirts of life
Those jeans are really cute
I was so disappointed
The world is unfair
Life is so unfair
Life is so unfair sometimes
Not all are sons of bitches
Not everyone is a motherfucker
I almost did it
I agree to your proposition
I saw your father
I believe that he knows it
My heart hurts
Everything is transitory
Guess what I bought today
Let me know what you think
The winters are cold in Canada
Patronise your own
Just a minute
I am not your father
I love Canadian public radio
Mary has two boyfriends
I think we forgot someone
She is wise beyond her years
He is wise beyond his years
Antibiotics are overused
Humans are lazy
Humans are naturally lazy
I know you want to go home
Your remark is irrelevant
She has children
She has two children
A north wind is blowing
I also have the right to speak
Tom always sings out of tune
I think Mary had been crying
It may be true
Tom tried the knob
Tom turned and ran after Mary
Tom was too nervous to speak
You have betrayed us
I can see it in your eyes
Prisons are full of lunatics
I could only shake my head
I could sure use your advice
I feel like an impostor
I know all about cars
I know what I know
I saved up my food for later
I shook my head no
I suppose you could be right
The ship is under sail
They put Tom in a straitjacket
Tom called me a scumbag
Tom coughed into his hand
Tom could hardly breathe
Tom could smell gasoline
There was blood on the floor
I get by
Tom made a run for it
You screwed with his head
Tom is in jail as he should be
Life does not tolerate delays
That rumor spread quickly
It made me really sad
Show her what you can do
Show him what you can do
Show me what you can do
Show them what you can do
You are capable of anything
Tom is in a foul mood today
Cairo has a very warm climate
What he says is very true
What she says is very true
The butterfly flutters
The bag is full
The banana is sweet
Dry your tears
He knew too much
She knew too much
I know his secret
I know her secret
I know your secret
Please spare my life
I like two girls
I like two guys
You got the walls all dirty
I enjoy being with him
I enjoy being with her
I enjoy being with you
Mary enjoys being with Tom
Tom enjoys being with Mary
We have great chemistry
We have good chemistry
He likes abandoned buildings
We have nothing else
I have nothing else
I have nothing else to do
I had nothing else to do
She had nothing else to do
She had nothing else to say
I had nothing else to say
She had nothing else to lose
I have nothing else to lose
I have nothing else to wear
Her dress was ruined
I loved this dress
I told him I was interested
I told her I was interested
I shrugged my shoulders
She shrugged her shoulders
My boyfriend is possessive
He makes me feel special
He enabled me to help him
We meet here once a week
Half the camp went on a hike
Tom claimed the inheritance
You can go now if you wish
That is a good question
I gave Mary chocolate
It will be warm some day
That is a mistake
That helped a lot
He is a music enthusiast
You will not remember
I will never forget
Kate looks amazing
The work is almost done
The work is almost finished
The flow is not that strong
I lost my sunglasses
I bought a new pair of glasses
Today is World No Tobacco Day
Clip your nails
Please clear out this closet
The museum is closed Sundays
Try to keep a clear head
Just go for it
Mr David seems tired
Tom put his wallet on the desk
Come here and give it a look
They are collaborators
You were simply tired
Tom has two cats

This will deaden the pain
She left her hair unadorned
That mag just prints trash
His mag wheels were spiffy
That is just an untruth
Mary had Tom on speed dial
That must really chafe
She gave an insouciant look
Tom lost to Mary at snooker

A dozen means twelve
Mary loves to snowboard
Tom likes to ski
No way Tom could do that

Of course

Tom can buy that

Today is revision day
No
Who knows where that came from

Tom was never the problem
Tom was always a golfer
We are three brothers
We are drinking tea

That plan could work
I enjoy reading my old diaries

Tom turned the lights on

Ask Tom
Maybe you should take me home

Stay against the wall
He could change his mind later

Today I rode a unicycle
Please wait patiently
It rained a lot this year
Please give me a hint
I want a hint
That was a good hint
Tom took the hint and left
Traffic accidents are rising
She responded with ease
My dad is in his room
This could take several days
The story seems unbelievable
You are the key

She was in a car
You were in a car
He took the corner too fast
She took the corner too fast
You took the corner too fast
The lift engineer came
Sleep as much as you want
I hope the fog lifts soon
Study where you want
Revise where you want
I spend the day talking
You gave me something
They were in Berlin
There are incorrect uses
Please tell me the exact time
A medical team came
We give money to the poor
Study what you want
You write
You will soon be married
It pains me to believe that
Our real enemy is someone else
He left you a message
The weather is extremely hot
Ali has a friend
You do you
Mary suggested we calm down
I bet no one is sleepy
He looked like a monkey
I was a precocious child
In the summer I leave the city
We can confirm that
Mom and I were in the garden
The forces were not equal
Do the right thing today
The tub is full
Everybody was mean to me
Those are the risks we take
Revolutions can be good or bad
That Tom is a bad influence
We have no reason to complain
This machine kills fascists
This website kills fascists
This language kills fascists
This car kills fascists
This sentence kills fascists
Put on your uniform
Walking is fun
A cafe overlooks the mill pond
A water wheel powers the mill
I took another swig of beer
No one would want to see that
My friend is Swiss
The plane is losing height
Tom is still offline
Yesterday morning
We met again after many years
All this is done by hand
A cat is like a human being
Rape is a violent crime
Tom sat quietly next to Mary
Mary sat quietly next to Tom
All this is handmade
Tom went to the flower market
The Dutch like windmills
Tom played with the kittens
Tom played with the puppies
Tom played with the puppets
Tom played with the dolls
There was no reason to worry
Those are the people we want
Everyone was mean to me
The men were starving
Everything here is handmade
My father got laid off
We set a trap to catch rabbits
My father is a surgeon
A good many people went there
The world is a village
All elections are important
You shall not steal
Character is on the ballot
Compassion is on the ballot
They are all on the ballot
You have my word
Yanni spoke little Berber
Try to distract yourself
It was time to take action
I admit not having the truth
I want someone to do it for me
Nobody counted on Tom to come
Nobody counted on Tom coming
Please no kissing
Yanni knew Skura had a safe
Yanni was a ruthless killer
Yanni opened the safe
Skura was a magnet for men
My car is that one over there
Mary rearranged the pillows
It might take a few months
You sound like you mean it
He is a strapping man

It may take much longer
This is a fun party trick

Go ahead and do what you want
You saw her
You saw them
They saw them
I went back to Australia
Shoppers want more options
He prefers to stay
She prefers to stay
Very interesting
I like beef more than lamb
She likes her new dress
I need some time to unwind
I know precisely what you mean
This steak is delicious
The world is a people
Please take care of my family
I like Japanese cuisine
I have it in my blood
That would take courage
There were ten of us
I get to do whatever I want
We can talk tomorrow
They say Tom is very rich
The blue van is mine
Something needs to be changed
We just want to help
The spindle and the distaff
They say that Tom is very rich
It makes me afraid
I must have fainted
Her eyes widened with horror
It was a present from my son
Notice
There is a mystery about her
You must not tell my mother
The girl hesitated
Mary played with the dolls
Tom played with action figures
Mary played with her dolls
Mary played with her doll
Tell them what to do
I live on this floor
He promises the moon
This is a poem I wrote for you
Marie will not swim tonight
He works in a store
She was telling jokes
He disobeys his parents
He gave him something to drink
He gave her something to drink
Give me the little book
I sang a beautiful song
He needs to wake up
Tom was telling jokes
His computer is plugged in
Her computer is plugged in
Jean looked at the hen
My phone screen is damaged
She is a professional diver
He is a firefighter
I continue singing
I keep singing
He has very fair skin
We have white teeth
There is a lot of smoke
They just finished
I only have five euros left
I cleaned everything
She is still at school
He was repainting the house
The sound is too weak
Marie is staying here
She had predicted it
His motorcycle is noisy
Her motorcycle is noisy
You were married
They were in agreement
I was taking a little nap
They live in Abkhazia
Prices will rise
It was cold this morning
He forgives me
We left our husbands
It was quite cold in Germany
Marie brought dessert
Tom is not disappointed
Sometimes I surprise myself
The bulb is broken
The turtle lives for centuries
Marie exaggerates everything
I hear Lise singing
He just found them
Open a door
Read my status
She is in love
You will eat my cake
I asked for something else
She moved
She has moved
To be more precise
They were coming down
You showered
His face was swollen
Her face was swollen
My son is expecting me
He likes to eat couscous
She was walking on all fours
Your comments make me laugh
The child has nothing to eat
They were walking on all fours
I will do it my way
The storm lasted two days
I was sharpening the knives
He took on a new identity
I do not skim their milk
He never eats vegetables
You are too drunk
He is my favourite author
I left them at home
We saw her at the airport
Nobody can stop time
Here is my new book
He abuses his power
She abuses her power
I am not qualified
The woman has two wallets
Give us another hint
It seems to be risky
The pools have remained empty
Now I am really tired
I like to study alone
I thanked her
They say that Tom is wealthy
Juan was born in June
Yawning is contagious
Go to work in Austria
Write down your goals
They say Tom is wealthy
Nobody wanted to come
Tell her what to do
No one had any problems
They did not hide that
What he has done is wrong
We never answer the phone
We have to do it now
We need to do it now
We will do it when Tom leaves
Tom died from exhaustion
Nobody talks about it
His face was cold and clammy
Tom got laid off
I swear I no longer drink
Kittens are adorable
Tom is not a furry
Tom is not addicted to heroin
We may have to do it
He can read in Russian
I can read in Russian
The city was deserted
Secrecy is important
The waves are impressive
The streets are busy
The streetlights are on
This man is Uzbek
My car burned up
The surprise is complete
The canteen is empty
The canteen is full
Your microphone is off
He has kept all her letters
He kept all her letters
The butter is salty
He is trying to commit suicide
He did not seem tired to me
The movie was very good
It was a very good movie
This rule needs to be changed
The hallway was very dark
That cap is too small for me
Look into the matter carefully
A lot of fish died
Swallows fly very fast
It started raining really hard
One of you has to go there
Turn off the computer
This here is Julia
I speak some languages
I have no nickname
She is Argentinian
Nobody knows about it
That was pretty rude
It was all in vain
The enemy ceased firing
We had no alternative
We went up the stairs
Only God can judge me
There is only one day
We went into the cave
Life can be a lot
We went down the stairs
This is goodbye then
Start whenever you want
The toilet is on the right
Nobody forced me to do this
Maria turned to the door
I had a prior commitment
Love and envy are siblings
Have a bath and then go to bed
It will not rain today
This cake is quite sweet
I was shearing the sheep
She forgot her book
She loved the wine
The boy is at the zoo
She is afraid of the spider
We forgot our umbrellas
I already know where it is
Chocolate is good
They will eat your raspberries
I will eat my cake
We eat and drink every day
They continued
She decided to get divorced
Turn the key to the left
Tom never eats vegetables

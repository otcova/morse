My house is small and cramped
I hate doing laundry
It was an arduous trip
Be cautious
Beware of wild animals
Tom has a twin sister
I can show you where it is
Be well
Tom asked me to go away
We had to sleep on the floor
I never hid anything from you
Prices are continuously rising
No reasons were given
See you Tuesday
I will eat an orange
You bother me
I was drinking wine
My condolences
We visited Cyprus
I give her a book
I give him a book
Tell him that I am sated
Tell him that I am full
You seem full of anger
We visited Hungary
She has three daughters
I have a mission for Tom
He reads in his room
She has three weeks
She loves all skirts
Someone is already there
She spat on the floor
My little finger hurts
He stabbed him in the back

Enjoy your time off
Each child will receive a gift

I translate
It was a great success
It was a good clock
It was of no use

It was a suicidal stunt
We fought
She talks too much

Hardly anyone criticises him
This pot has no lid
The wind got stronger
Wear something blue
The sun has burnt his back
No explanations were given
No explanation was given
No reason was given
I was mesmerized by the music
You talked to me in your sleep
Tom is running away from you
I just like it
Tom looked different back then
Leave her here
Leave them here
We have no time to study
You would really enjoy it here
Tom has to call his doctor
Tom needs to call his doctor
Tom should call his doctor
It appears to be a suicide
It does appear to be a suicide
Excessive frankness is harmful
Comments are excessive
Probably I was unduly straight
This is too big and undue risk
Congratulations are excessive
Nothing is over yet
We were in shock
Some variants exist
I like that chord progression
I think I was just homesick
I think Tom was homesick
He collapsed
They immediately called Tom
Tom drove her into safety
I hit my foot against the door
Either Tom leaves or I will
It lasted short time
Ladies and gentlemen

Have a good day
He seems a little put out

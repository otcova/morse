We sure miss Tom
I was going to eat that
Tom saw Mary entering the cave
My cat chirps
Mary was wearing makeup
Tom smoked us up
My cat tweets
We like our house
Mine is being creative
Lots of people get hungry
My name is Tom
I knew that before you did
I stood up for myself
Tom asked Mary to come outside
We saw our names on the list
I do hope that Tom is happy
This is a very sad song
We need to rent a car
Tom was an interpreter
We did our work
Tom saw Mary with her mother
We need to check our schedules
I want to buy a hat
I want to work at my own pace
You need to pace yourself
We need to pace ourselves
Tom was pretty quick
I can contribute
Yay
We can manage on our own
Tom slept in this bed
We were in way over our heads
Tom was very agitated
Our barn was cheap to build
We turned off our computers
We need to find jobs
We let our dog sleep inside
It will be easier later
But then we made up
Tom was really young then
Then everyone drank coffee
I sweat a lot at night
Then Tom and I moved
Tom wants us to do this
We had our shoes polished
We got Tom to wash our car
We like our school
We locked our bikes
I wonder where he went
Tom saw somebody coming
Tom went there after school
We bit our tongues
Tom washed his ears
Shit hit the fan
Tom saw Mary and John there
We need our canes
Tom did the dishes
Let me see if I can help you
We looked over our shoulders
He was very rude to her
Tom saw Mary tense up
Nobody has seen Tom since then
We have our own problems
We put our boots on
Tom saw the fight
The hold was empty
This cabin is built from logs
We know how to do our jobs
We just sold Tom our car
My throat is a little sore
Tom was a really cute kid
We got our license revoked
Tom was there before we were
We want you to be our coach
We hurt our backs
We put our socks on
I hope Tom makes it
We need to get some air
We bought our tickets online
Tom was shot again

Tom shared his plans with me
Tom shared his doubts with me
Maria is at the airport
Mary saw her at the airport
She saw her at the airport
Tom saw her at the airport
Tom saw him at the airport
He saw her at the airport
They live far from the airport
We even have an airport
We fired our chauffeur
Tom saw Mary and John talking
We pay our bills on time
We can do that on our own
We missed our stop
I have a question
We put our sunglasses on
Tom was at the counter
The bicycle needs to be fixed
He ran into some problems
I know the lyrics to this song
The book is amusing
That book is amusing
The sea is roaring
The sea roars
My nipples were getting hard
He bit his tongue
He feels cold
Tom saw Mary trying to do that
We took off our coats
We took our coats off
I definitely need one of those
We met Tom on our way here
You guys are totally lame
Please fuck off
I just started my job
Tom was very amused
Tom went hunting in the woods
We took our shirts off
We took off our shirts

Eat this bread
Things are back to normal

I saw the picture
Tom was meditating
Tom went into the bar
We were only too glad to help
Tom saw Mary coming in
We took off our sunglasses
We got into our car
We got out of our car
I can already see them
I see them often
I rarely see them
Tom was visibly angry
I often see them here
We have to weigh our options
Open your hearts
Time heals broken hearts
He hung onto me
She hung onto me
It hung onto me
He has a heart arrhythmia
It warms my heart
Tom hopes he can win
You know where
You know who it is
You know that we are here
You know what they want
Tom was always very nice to me
They have a large apartment
They have a big apartment
He wants to sell it to me
I was forced to sign the paper
He teaches me English
Like you know
The yellow toy is small
I detest rockets
The ship came into port
No one could see Tom
Then the teacher punished him
Mary works at a travel agency
Press the key
Tom saw what was going on
We abandoned our plans
Tom looked over and saw Mary
Thanks for being here with us

Tom seemed very distraught
Tom was irritable
Tom saw Mary and smiled
We sold our car last week
Tom did very well on his test
Leave before Tom sees you here
His bag is on my desk
Her bag is on my desk
Mary is hiding it
Our trip came to an end
You met Mary yesterday
You guys met Mary yesterday
Dust mites feed on skin cells
The Varig left on time
Tom has got to see this
I like the marble more
It completely went past me
We both hurt our knees
Many slaves were freed
He likes to be alone
Tom was really sorry
We stayed with our uncle
I hope Tom gets to do that
We just sold our car to Tom
He moved to Chicago
Tom saw someone coming
Tom washed behind his ears
We had our picture taken
We have our hands full

Mostly a curse
We closed our eyes
It may have been defective
We put on our sunglasses
Tom saw Mary enter the cave
We were very proud of our son
I have to take a walk
Tom was covered in mud
We invited all our friends
I wish Tom would believe me

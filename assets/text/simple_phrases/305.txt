I never was successful
I bet on horses
I was dirty when I got home
I never was overweight
I behaved badly
Our vacation is almost over
I never was optimistic
I began working
I would leave if I were you
I need to take it easy
I began running
Mary won the beauty contest
I might be there early
I ate the salad
Mary was wearing a fur coat
I ate an orange
Mary wants to be an actress
I just love basketball
I ate all of it
Mary still plays with dolls
I arrived first
Mary is prettier than Alice
I had a cold last week
I arrived early
I almost smiled
Mary has a very pretty face
I can wait if you want me to
Mary had her handbag stolen
I do a lot of swimming
Make sure you lock the door
I did what everyone else did
It may be snowing in Boston
I brought this with me
I bought a down jacket
Everyone knows you did that
I ate my lunch earlier
I always do the dishes
I always carry a knife
I almost never do that
I almost died that day
I fried an egg for breakfast
I guess it might be possible
I hardly ever have headaches
I have everything I need now
I have never skipped a class
I hope nobody feels that way
I knew I had something to do
I may not come to your party
I now know why that happened
I seldom go hiking by myself
I wore this yesterday
I think I did OK on the test
We got off to a good start
I was just going home
I was advised not to do that
I was happy with the results
I tried to be evasive
I was popular in high school
I was very sick at that time
I think I was amusing
I think I saw a ghost
I seldom go to church
This is my first time here
I seldom drink coffee
This is just what I needed
I wonder how much that costs
I read a lot of books
This is highly recommended
I work there for three years
I never walk barefoot
Think carefully about this
I never walk anywhere
They may be busy right now
These are half price today
I hope I can help you
I hardly ever do that
Pets can be very expensive
I got dressed quickly
Perhaps I was a bit greedy
Nobody knows what happened
I do a lot of cooking
Mary makes her own clothes
Mary is wearing high heels
Mary is tall and beautiful
Mary is knitting a sweater
I can run really fast
Mary is a really nice lady
I can already do that
I came here by myself
I believe I was wrong
I believe I was right
It was very cold in Boston
It was extremely difficult
I always sit in the front row
It happened really quickly
I always try to avoid trouble
It feels weird not working
Hot dogs are three dollars
I deeply regret that decision
I write poetry
I work indoors
You must be really hungry
I wore a hoody
I wish I were famous
I went out by myself
I won the game
I had intended to go shopping
I was wrong to do it
I went outside
I had to wait for a long time
I was on TV recently
I have no choice but to fight
I was being truthful
We waited a little longer
I tried to look busy
I was worn out
We need to take a picture
I have no plans at this point
I tried to keep warm
I was very sad
We must hope for the best
I have to give it back anyway
I thought I was done
I was unharmed
We might do that tomorrow
I have to make a note of that
I was truthful
We hope you enjoy it here
I seldom eat seafood
I was the star
We have to do it together
I seldom eat at home
I was selected
We have to deal with that
I refused to do that
I was relieved
I need some rest now
I was punished
We do all sorts of things
I hope my prediction is wrong
I may need your help
I was punctual
I hope nobody feels like that
I like to tell jokes
I was promoted
Things are well organized
I was prepared
I hope they catch the shooter
I let everybody down
I was poisoned
I hope they get it fixed soon
I insisted on paying
I was outraged
They walked home together
I hope this advice is helpful
I have a lot of cats
I was obedient
I failed three times
I was left out
I do a lot of skiing
I was laid off
I cut my hair myself
I was inspired
I was in agony
I was homesick
That was very scary to me
I was gullible
That never occurred to me
I just had the carpet cleaned
I was ecstatic
I just wish I could get a job
I was discreet
Our team is likely to win
I knew I had to buy something
I was deported
I knew both of them very well
I was defeated
Mary screamed and fainted
I knew it was going to happen
I was abducted
Mary is prettier than you
I knew that this would happen
I wanted money
Mary is a wonderful woman
I knew you would do something
I wanted a job
I want updates
I know I was wrong about that
I want results
I know better than to do that
I walk quickly
I know it was partly my fault
I watch a lot of TV
I took the job
I was too ambitious
I took a break
I left Boston three years ago
I tried to stand up
I talked a lot
I lived there for a few years
I sometimes stutter
I studied hard
It was pretty spectacular
I moved as quickly as I could
I seldom wear a hat
I stole a boat
It was a great experience
I must agree with you on this
I seldom skip meals
I stole a base
Go back home to Australia
I never was much of a swimmer
I often shop online
I stayed quiet
I said good night to everyone
I often read in bed
I shut the lid
I seldom visit Boston anymore
I never was unlucky
I should relax
All the children like you
I spoke as quietly as I could
I needed more money
I should be OK
I stepped back from the cliff
I might not do that
I scream a lot
I may still do that
I scare easily
You must be really tired
I think we can do it tomorrow
I like strawberries
I saw a doctor
I knew this already
I sat on a log
I have news for you
I said goodbye
I think you did it on purpose
I drove myself home
I rented a car
I thought it was kind of cool
I ran for help
I thought maybe I should stop
I caught three fish
I put on a tie
I thought that was well known
I can run very fast
I plan to move
We used to do that a lot
I totally agree with you both
I painted that
I tried to be more aggressive
I now know why
I walked so much my feet hurt
I need glasses
That was very gratifying
I was allowed to go with them
I may not come
Shut up and listen to me
I was just trying to be smart
I made partner
Please get out of my way
I was just trying to be tough
I made a noise
I was one of the unlucky ones
I loved school
Mary is wearing a brooch
I was pleased with the result
I love to fish
Mary is knitting a scarf
I was pretty excited about it
I love singing
Mary is getting prettier
I was pretty happy about that
I love fishing
Mary is a charming woman
I was scared and stressed out
I looked at it
I was sure I was going to die
I lit the oven
I was very busy all last week
I lit the fuse
Last night was very cold
I lit the fire
I like writing
I wear a tie almost every day
I was really drunk
I like winning
Everybody wanted to sing
I should be in bed

I like to hunt
I pulled the lever
I like to draw
I often wear boots
I like to bowl
I would say the worst is over

I like farming
I never was skinny

I enjoy doing that
I kept yelling
I kept walking
I did it correctly
I kept texting
I kept talking
I always work hard
I kept staring
I kept smiling
I kept singing
I kept running
We often talk about you
I kept pushing
I kept playing
I kept packing
I kept focused
That should be possible
I kept driving
That might be dangerous
I was my own boss
I kept digging
Thanks for posting this
I sure am thirsty
I just came in
Perhaps I should resign
I seldom get sick
I helped a lot
Nobody knows what to do
I seldom eat meat
I have the flu
No one likes to do that
I never wear pink
I have my keys
Tom was here one day last week
I need a new coat
I have company
Mary is a capable nurse
Tom used to be engaged to Mary
I loved them both
I have a ranch
Let me help you do that
Tom tried to hit me last night
I love basketball
I have a radio
It was a great surprise
Tom took a book from the shelf

I had to hurry
Tom said I was being obnoxious
I have a fast car
I had jeans on
Tom rode his bike to the store
I had a choice
Tom put his hand over his face
I almost never have nightmares
I brought a salad
I got very mad
I always knew it was important
I always get lost
I got no reply
I always make a mess of things
I always eat well
I got it wrong
I always wanted to be a cowboy
I got it right
I always wanted to be a writer
I got into bed
I appreciate you talking to me
I got a tattoo
I believe the opposite is true
I glanced back
I can remember it very vividly
I glanced away
I would like to go and see Tom
I finally left
I told Tom not to believe Mary
I felt trapped
I felt nothing
I felt foolish
I felt awkward
I complained to Tom about that
I could do that if I wanted to
I felt ashamed
I already know what Tom thinks
I decided that was a good sign
I felt amazing
I did the same thing in Boston
I fed the pigs
I expect a lot
I eat anything
Tom wants to come and see you
I drank a shot
Tom said that I was too noisy
I drank a beer
Tom said that I sounded tired
I did it wrong
We really enjoyed that
I cut the tape
We might as well leave
Tom must be expecting company
I cut the rope
Tom is better known than Mary
I waved the flag
I created this
Tom has improved a great deal
I changed that
Those were tough times
They say Tom is very peculiar
I was mesmerized
I changed jobs
They might not do that
Perhaps Tom has fallen asleep
I was in trouble
They all made mistakes
I seldom speak to Tom anymore
I was in a fight
That happened long ago
I know his middle name is Tom
I was hypnotized
Our plans have changed
I gave Tom a key to my office
I was badly hurt
I can run fast
Nobody is stopping you
I discussed the plan with Tom
I wanted revenge
I can go first
Life is difficult here
I turned the key
I brought that
Let me help you choose
I tried to smile
I bought a dog
Leave the windows open
I sure am hungry
I bought a car
Tom was too excited to sleep
I stood up again
I began to run
Tom said I looked a bit pale
I stifled a grin
I began to eat
It was pretty exciting
Tom must be somewhere around
I sliced the ham
I began pacing
It sure is windy today
Tom meant it as a compliment
I sipped my wine
I began crying
Their names are Tom and Mary
I shut the trunk
I arrived late
I seldom do that
I arrived last
Go put some clothes on
I sat very still
I agreed to go
I have to do everything myself
I sat on the bed
I think Tom agrees with Mary
I sat down again
Come visit us sometime
I sat at the bar
I lived with Tom for a while
I said it was OK
Both men were executed
I resigned today
Both girls were crying
Tom said I looked beautiful
I just have to get out of here
I remained still
Be prepared to do that
Tom has worked hard all day
I just wish I could find a job
I remained quiet
Tom did that all by himself
I lit a candle so we could see
I put on my coat
I taught Tom how to do that
I made an omelet for breakfast
I owe you dinner
I showed Tom how to do that
I never wanted to study French

We should consider it

I opened the box
We do this every year
Tom said I sounded worried
I sometimes sing in the shower
I opened the bag
Tom said I looked stunning
I sometimes sleep on the couch
I never was rich
Tom said I looked horrible
I stayed there for a long time
I never was poor
Tom said I looked confused
I stayed there for three hours

That sounds expensive
I think I was wrong about that
I might get lost
I stole something from Tom
I might be right
Please say that again
I looked outside
Please come back soon

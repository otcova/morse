That is our baseball field
Keep watch on that man
You should have come with us
Have you ever climbed Mt
You are as tall as my sister
You have to speak only English
You do not have to come here
You are both pretty and kind
Deposit your money in the bank
You are all our guests tonight
You can trust him with any job
Brothers should not quarrel
Marriage proposals flooded in
There is no grass on the moon
The moon rises in the east
I envy you
My watch is wrong
London must be cold now
I have been busy this week
There is little wind today
It is a payday today
That will be enough for now
You will succeed in the end
There is little time left
I laughed in spite of myself
You will see that I am right
We sat round the fire
All of us like you very much
You are no younger than I am
I can not afford to buy it
My house looks to the south
My knowledge of German is poor
My hobby is reading novels
My grade is above the average
My father is an early riser
My father is young

I can not answer your question
I envy you your success

Time for bed

Kobe is famous for its port
Kobe is famous as a port city
My grandmother has got old
You have done a wonderful job
You should not rely on others

They are typical young people
They like English
They went to Kyoto last year

Give me your hand
My battery is flat
You did not answer my question
You are twice as strong as me
The tap is off
It explains a lot
He looks scared of mum
Tom wanted a Porsche
The train is past the switch
Wait a while
I drink
This is an answering machine
Thank you
She has got a book

One of the two must leave

She learns Chinese too
He also learns Chinese
He also studies Chinese

I know she is in France
The tickets are free of charge
Tom is a very kind man
I have to protect this car
I am travelling
He smoked

You can stay if you want to
She was made for this
You are not coming
It is getting very late
Improve your skills
He eats
She eats
God is the lord of time
I was bitten by an ant
He had both a fever and chills
Nobody wants that to happen
Sami is still in the bathroom
The doors are closing
There was fog yesterday noon

His father passed away
Good thing they are better
Rightfully so
Use YouTube
I hate YouTube
Your daughter needs help
I posted it on YouTube
Mary is wearing a red skirt
Tom has always acted superior
Be wary of Tom
We shared many dreams together
I am always cheated on
She won his affection
My father is an active person
She felt raped
Listen to this podcast
I just wanted to
He gave her the address
Creativity loves constraints
Reading is one of my hobbies
We need to go back
He waited for a long time
He was waiting a long time
Nice
Reduce it
Yanni was watching YouTube
Yanni was wearing jean shorts
He slowly opened his eyes
Tom was taking a shower
Not yet
Nobody had come
Not this time
Wait a minute
She has amazing eyes
Mary never calls him anymore
She was dying from boredom
Some sentences are too long
No way to know for sure
Over the years they lost touch
Rainbows always cheered him up
Seven was her lucky number
A dozen means twelve
Mary loves to snowboard
No way Tom could do that
Tom loves tomatoes
Mary loves to grow them
They do it on TV all the time
You can read it after her
She can read it after you
A wasp flew in the window
Of course
I went to Rome on business
He is a strapping man
We never answer the phone
Even Tom condemns that
Please wear a mask
I had to give up
Yanni was yelling in Berber
Tom has given me no chance
There was no student missing
The hotel is over there
I cut my own hair
My son really likes slugs
He was circumcised
He will see her this evening
He will see him this evening
She will see him this evening
She will see her this evening
I lost my virginity
I handed him a beer
He admitted to me he was gay
I only shower with real men
Tom was buried by an avalanche
I just want to learn
He was a simple man
We get on pretty well
I can do paperwork
He was stark naked
We will be living together
I listen to French radio
This seems wrong to me
I listen to the French radio
Go ask Tom what he wants
He was getting a hard on
It requires a little practice
Spend time in nature
Get out of your comfort zone
I had noticed that
So just keep that in mind
He gave me a kiss on the mouth
I am sorry if I scared you
I feel horny
The worst part is over
I have never felt so good
I gradually picked up the pace
I was covered in sweat
I moaned in pleasure
I felt a sense of relief
My family was waiting for us
I need good friends
I invited him in
We chatted about nonsense
I ran upstairs to his office
We should have a talk
He sucked my earlobe
Her sense of moral shame
She was the neighborhood slut
They roared with laughter
Shut off your phone
Manage your time wisely
He pees sitting down
My name is Marie
We got back to school
Our lips were pressed together
He interrupted my thoughts
The parking here is ridiculous
I live in a nice neighborhood
He shows off at school
We shared a bathroom
He was an outspoken racist
He was completely unashamed
I went completly red
Teach her to live without you
I desperately love him
He said it out of anger
He wanted me to entertain him
Refuse to play the victim
He hurt me so badly
He just needs a hug
I trusted him blindly
Mango is a tasty fruit
She keeps extra sheets on hand
He was bullying him
He saved me from drowning
He draws naked people
We are barbarians
He judges me constantly
I need to take a shit
He was in heat
A better friend came along
I trust no one but myself
We entered the shower together
Tom is in his cabin
That lawyer has many clients
Tom brought us up to date
That lawyer drew up my will
It was quiet everywhere
Tom is deaf in both ears
Tom is only deaf in one ear
Tom opened the garage door
No one wants to look foolish
Nobody wants to look foolish
Prices will keep on going up
Nobody met me
Tom is drinking again
Tom is vomiting
Tom is a good diplomat
There was a crash
Tom hardly ever sings
Tom almost never sings
Tom said he wanted a divorce
Tom is in it for the money
Help me fill this out

I have nothing to write about
Let me see your ID
She helped me a lot
Stop begging
Tom may believe you
This cider is incredible
I love rocking chairs
I love my rocking chair
Show me what you drew
Get out of the car now
Turn the light on

Remind me tomorrow

I enjoy speaking Hungarian
No one bothered me
Tom headed back to the camp
No one met me

Stop annoying me
We entered the city
Tom is thinner than me
Write me a letter
Tom liked how you did that
They chased me
Give me that candle
Tom heard somebody sneeze
Tell me what to buy
Tom made an effort
This soup tastes awful
This news upset me
Nobody needs it
Do me a favor and leave
Tom is going to enjoy it here
I was ready for anything
We were ready for anything
The men surrounded me
Tom is a physical trainer
There was a pause
Tom might do it alone
Show me some tricks
Tom is fatter than me
Stay here and lock the door
Tom missed the speech
I am scared of the results
Get me out of this
Tom is here all the time
This is not very polite
That upset me
Tom is a lecturer
Go down there
Tom brought me a chair
He was in London two years ago
We went to pick strawberries
Tom moves slowly
It upset me
Tom cursed silently
I lost this game
Tom is a lot like you
Take my umbrella
Tom has a cabin near a lake
It worries me
Tim is going to move here soon
Tom will move here soon
Tom will let me do that
Help me here
There is a misunderstanding
We took a detour
Tom sat to my left
Please show me your ID
He earns a big salary
I believe in me
He bought a fast car
A girl stole my heart
I know where they live
Coffee wakes me up
Tom is authorized to do that
We both voted yes
It keeps breaking down
Try to love everyone
Tom is twice your age
Tom went to the party
Please hire me
Ask me what I want
Tom is quite unpopular
We need cement and sand
Tom behaved defiantly
She can come any moment
Mary forgot her son in the car
Guess who wrote me
I give you a clue
She has to do that again
Tom said he saw cops outside
What I saw shocked me
Tom is kind of nutty
Tom might sell it to me
Now I think so as well
Give me the sponge
Now I also think so

She is not happy
Tom bought a new watch
I am reading

Yanni wants to follow Skura
Yanni went into his bedroom
Yanni tried to comfort Skura

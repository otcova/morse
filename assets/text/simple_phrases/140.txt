Step back
Calm down
I said to myself
Leave me alone for a while
You look pale
Not at all

This is an emergency
This is too difficult for me
Yes
Tony had it
Let me go with you
This car is easy to drive
I swim in the sea every day
This room smells musty
This is a daily newspaper
They are longing for city life
I wonder if you can really try
You are just great
You must make up for lost time
You are pushing matters
You have only to keep silent
You are a troublemaker
You should keep your promise
He is a merry fellow
You speak fluent English
You should obey your parents
You have to obey your parents
You must be more independent
You must never resort to force
It is time you got married
You acted after your nature
I cannot praise you enough
I have a surprise for you
You remind me of my mother
I was not scolding you
The rest is up to you
I believe in you
I am counting on you
All but you are wrong
All will go except you
You be quiet
I have a job for you
You must learn from mistakes
You are new students

The economy is picking up
Experience is the best teacher
I major in economics
The stepmother was hard on her
The plans have been drawn up
We started according to plan
The plan has worked well
Our plan is made
The plans are still fluid
The plan was being discussed
I had to give up my plan
To execute a plan was simple
We organized a project team
Forewarned is forearmed
A policeman came up to me
A policeman came up to him
The police held the crowd back
The policeman followed him
The policeman caught the thief

Art is my lifework

No man is without his faults
No one is free from faults

Never judge by appearance
It is far from a joke
Never speak ill of others
Never let me go
Never break your promise
You must stick to your diet
I decided
It rests with you to decide
Abide by your promise
The day of decision is at hand
The decision was put off
The decision rests with him
Let me put off my decision
The decision belongs to him
Face the music
The result is all that matters
The result is still in doubt
The results were as follows
The results were negative
You were wrong after all
The day turned fine after all
Nothing happened after all
She will fail eventually
You were right after all
My plan was eventually adopted
I have lost the case after all
His plan went well after all
He did not buy it after all
She is a child after all
All right
OK
Go ahead
I want to marry you
Oh that I had never married
Marriage proposals flooded in
Marriage is a lottery
Marriage is a serious matter
Wedlock is a padlock
Marriage is the tomb of life
The wedding was put off
The blood ran red
Blood ran from his wound
My phlegm has blood in it
Blood will have blood
I passed clots
The blood was a dark color
Blood runs in the veins
Blood is thicker than water
The blood was bright red
Blood will tell
The blood made her excited
The blood test is normal
I had blood in my urine
I have bloody stools

The moon rose above the hill
The moon is low in the sky
The moon is risen
The moon is shining bright
The moon has set
The moon has gone down
The moon is shining brightly

There is no grass on the moon
There is no life on the moon

The moonlight shone brightly
The moon is already up
The moon is behind the clouds
The moon was shining brightly
The moon rises in the east
The moon shines at night
The moon cast a gentle light

Look at the dog jump
A dog ran about in the garden
A dog was running after a cat
A dog bit her on the leg
A dog suddenly jumped at me
A dog is barking
The dog barked at the mailman
The dog is a faithful animal
You must take care of your dog
No dogs allowed
The dog jumped over a chair
The dog ran after the rabbit
The dog is after the fox
The dog ran after a fox
The dog ran around and around
All dogs are faithful
The dog snapped up the meat
We have to keep our dog tied
The dog was hit by a truck
The dog ran after the ball
Dogs often bury bones
A dog can see in the dark
Dogs can swim
The dog followed me to my home
A dog will bark at strangers
The dog walked backward
Dogs see in black and white
A dog has four legs
The dog slipped his collar
The dog looked into the water

Look
This is natto
You should try to see it

Seeing is believing

I know him by sight

Rise and shine
Clear up the cause
She says she is seeing things
I heard the front door slam
The front door was open
The doorbell is ringing
I heard the doorbell ring
Go and see who it is
Charge this to my account
Someone stole my cash
Everything is all right now
We need no more men at present
Fall from reality
You should face reality
We live in the atomic age
Modern art means little to me
Do as you were told to do
You are going too far
Little remains to be said
Settle the argument soon
State your case briefly
Easier said than done
My lips are sealed
Come on out with it
Save your breath
Do as you are told
Do it as you are told
Please read between the lines
I like languages
Language is peculiar to man
Language is unique to man
I am at a loss for words
Words failed me
Watch your language
Words cannot express it
Watch out for your tongue
Her accent gave her away
Words stand for ideas
Words serve to express ideas
Put in a good word for me
Each individual is different
I disposed of my old coat
An antique pot was dug out
The old house was taken down
I was looking at old pictures
Reading classics is not easy
I have difficulty breathing
I have hard stools
They are two separate things
Some people enjoy solitude
Know who you are
Live and let live
To know oneself is not easy
I heard the door open
The door blew open
Lock the door without fail
The door opens from within
The door bolts on the inside
The door remains closed
Hold the door
I heard a knock at the door
Take exercises out of doors
It is dark out of doors
I looked in the cupboard
The trouble lay in the engine
It seems out of order
The trouble lies in the engine
There was thin ice on the lake
The lake is deep here
The house by the lake is mine
We came in view of the lake

The lake was bound in ice

A fox was caught in the snare
A tiger appears near here
A tiger is a beast of prey

It will rain in the afternoon
I called him this morning
Goro is good at English
I will telephone you later on
I have tennis practice later
Let me know the results later
Please call me up later
Please contact me later
This will bring you to grief
There will be the deuce to pay
I want it tapered in the back
He raised his heel against me
Shadow him
It leaves a bad aftertaste
She implored for mercy
Weigh your words well
I envy you
You cannot be serious
May you be happy
Bring the water to a boil
Please leave nothing behind
They were good rivals at go
Correct errors
This is the operator
This is an operator
The negotiation is off
Traffic is all tied up
You must take care driving
I got a traffic ticket
An accident has happened
The traffic was very heavy
I was caught in a traffic jam
Traffic was light
Light has come into the world
Too much light hurts the eye
Time flies like an arrow
I got off at the park
It was fun playing in the park
Go to the park
I walked toward the park
The park is well wooded
The park was full of people
I walked across the park
I work for public welfare
My tongue slipped
It is easy to talk
My mouth was dry
Out of the mouth comes evil
Open your mouth
I told you again and again
Please rinse out your mouth
You keep out of this
Open your mouth wide
Shut your mouth
I want to close my account
Great talkers are little doers
I have bad breath
Few words show men wise
You talk too much
Please put in this way
I have a ulcer in my mouth
Please stand face to face
The wind blew against the sail
Look at that koala over there
We saw a small island beyond
Can you see Mt
Fuji
You will play into their hands
I am thirsty
The pleasure is mine
You can do whatever you like
Do what you like
Cut and come again
You may come whenever you like
You can call me any time
Put it where you like
You can go anyplace you like
Choose any dress you like
Buy any dress you like
You may choose what you like
You may come and go at will
You may play at your pleasure
You may dance as you please
You can travel how you please
Choose any flowers you like
Eat whatever food you like
Give it to whomever you like
Read whatever you like
Suit yourself
I appreciate it
Fortune beamed on him
Curiosity killed the cat
Strike while the iron is hot
Good times alternate with bad
The factory did not want him
Fair words butter no parsnips
Luckily nobody got wet
Happily he did not die
She was not seriously injured
She said that she was happy
Fortune smiled on him
Luckily she did not die
I wish you the best of luck
Happiness lies in contentment
You cannot buy happiness
Hiroko sat there all alone
Hiroko has charming features
A vast desert lay before us
Take your time
I have menopausal troubles
The schoolyard was very small
I met her on campus yesterday
The flood began to subside
The flood parted them
Work like a bee
A coin rolled under the desk
I want another cup of tea
Put a dash of brandy in my tea
Add sugar to the tea
I want to think about it
You think too much
Tell me what you have in mind
Think about it
Second thoughts are best
Every imaginable means
I think you worry too much
Cultivate the wilderness
Handsome is as handsome done
It was wise of you not to go
I will go if I must
Go when you want
Keep on going
I decided not to go
We have no choice but to go
You are free to go or to stay
Do as I told you
I begged her not to go
You are allowed to go
Go and help wash the dishes
Go and see him in person
You can read between the lines
Manners make the man
The time is ripe for action
The parade passed our school
The speaker cleared his throat
The lecture was above me
I give up
I would rather die than yield
The surrender terms were harsh
A tall building stands there
I have high blood pressure
I used to run at high school
The highway is snarled up
The total is one hundred
Please bring the master key
Give the password
The whistle blew
Catch a signal
The Diet has been dissolved
The Diet is now in session
Parliament is now in session
The Diet broke up in confusion
The Diet will open next Monday
The people acclaimed him King
It will damage the crops
Black clouds are gathering
Black cloth absorbs light
I saw a woman in black
Two blacks do not make a white
Black becomes you
Dark clouds are hanging low
A black and white dog bit me
Look at the blackboard
My back is killing me
Please take this seat
Love sees no faults
The bone caught in my throat
A bone stuck in my throat
I was chilled to the bone
All my effort went for nothing
Great pains but all in vain
Let it all out
Get me out of here
It is cloudy now
Tiny pets are in fashion now
I wish I were in Paris now

It is another story now
I see life differently now
The job is up for grabs now
It is threatening to rain
There is every sign of rain

A storm is imminent
You will yet regret it
I love what you are
Do it when you have time
This will do for now

We just arrived at the station
My watch has gone wrong
I cast aside my chains
This is the last game
Let me go just once
Give up on this one
You cannot fail this time
This time Bob is likely to win
This is a special occasion
This time my goal is Paris
It even has a storyline
I feel like crying now

The lines are crossed
The confusion is all over
The soul animates the body
Mr Sato called at eleven
Mr Sato is on another line
Mr Sato speaks English well
Take the road on the left
Turn hard left
Turn to the left
Lie down on your left side
Raise your left hand
My lower left back tooth hurts
Keep to the left
My left foot is asleep
I got my left arm bruised
That will be enough for now

My legs ache from sitting
Sit down and rest for a while
Take the weight off your feet
This is a comfortable chair
Two seats remained vacant
All seats are reserved
Please save my place
I booked a seat
It brought me down to earth

The worst situation resulted
You must prepare for the worst
The worst is still to come
The worst is over

Recently he bothers me
Prices dropped recently

The last wound proved fatal
You will succeed in the end

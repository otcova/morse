Ziri quietly followed Rima
Ziri should have known
Ziri chose not to believe Rima
Ziri can leave us now
Ziri is now free
These forests are haunted
The air was crisp and cold
Ziri entered the jungle
Ziri exited the forest
Ziri heard a strange noise
Ziri heard something else
There were so many voices
Ziri could not rationalize it
Ziri continued his walk
The sound lessened
Ziri hurried his pace
Ziri was playing in the woods
Ziri had no other suggestions
The topic was left alone
Ziri saw that the previous day
Ziri returned to that spot
Ziri stepped over the line
Something was out there
Ziri took a step forward
Ziri watched on
Ziri has been watching Rima
Ziri paced backwards
Ziri regained his footing
Ziri could not see that
Ziri was laughing at himself
Ziri would have been chastised
Ziri is a logical person
Ziri opted to avoid the woods
Ziri felt at risk
Ziri felt a little on edge
Ziri went on a scenic tour
Nothing strange happened
The sun was beginning to set
Ziri led us out of the forest
Ziri approached the rocks
Ziri passed between the rocks
Ziri was no longer there
Ziri found nothing there
Ziri found no one there
Ziri could not escape it
Ziri only watched
Ziri is approaching
Ziri fell backwards
The noise died down
Ziri was no longer walking
Ziri heard a child crying
The noise quieted
A friend was there with Ziri
It was below zero at the time
Ziri followed the path
Ziri knew where he was again
Ziri fell forward
Ziri lost his balance
Ziri walked past the rocks
Ziri hugged his partner
Ziri guided Rima to safety
Ziri was down on his luck
Ziri kept it a secret
The symptoms began to abate
Neither one of us had a car

Those spirits can be scared
School ended

Ziri was staring at the wall
Ziri nearly soiled himself
Ziri acted disgusted
Ziri was a moody teenager
Ziri just wanted to go home

Ziri threw rocks at dogs
Ziri has trashed the place
Ziri trashed the graveyard
Ziri littered everywhere
Ziri has a white Jindo
Ziri may have gone hunting
Ziri went out to look for Rima
Ziri stared into the mountains
Ziri still misses his Jindo
Ziri tried to sleep
The magpies are too loud
Ziri was banging at the window
Ziri left an offering there
The offering is gone
It felt like incest
Ziri died of a heart attack
Ziri was stunned
Ziri holds dear those values
Ziri was gone just like that
Ziri was inconsolable
Ziri even physically hurt Rima
There is a spirit nearby
Ziri was visiting his family
Ziri stepped outside
Ziri entered the vehicle
Ziri stabbed Rima in the head
Ziri has not returned home
Police rushed into action
Ziri began to flee

I intend to pay for him

My phone is muted all the time
The sun provides us with light
Our source of light is the sun
Keep in mind what you said
She was a rare person
Police lie
You could benefit from this
You should see a psychiatrist
He faints when he sees blood
That test was hard
That test was difficult
He totally lost the plot
Your king is in check
His bishop has been captured
Black to move
We are in a bad way
Not unless my sister goes
Sure do

So did you
Just once
Like you care
End of story
My point exactly

He showed poor sportsmanship
Try clicking on the taskbar
Somehow she tore her labia
The tassel on their bag broke
I lost my pinecone
Tom is a BTS devotee
His stilt broke
Their lawyer filed an appeal
She ripped her pelvic floor
Sheep populate the town
She is the custodial parent
Your workspace is a mess
This is one fluid ounce
Her hair is rather porous
I find his works interesting
Wood is solid
I did him a favour
You could always go with me
I fell for her
I thought you could use it
You always turn a deaf ear
Your plans sound vague to me
Moralists make me itch
She prepared us a snack
He clubbed the trembling dog
The way of life has changed
Lifestyles have changed
Living habits have changed
The way we live has changed
Life expectancy has increased
The cold is making me tremble
My hands are numb
Money breeds contempt
It ended badly between us
They threw eggs at my head
Jackson is his last name
His first name is Tom
Tom is his middle name
His first name is John
ACAB includes Tom
The Internet is a fad
He had nowhere else to go
The dentist extracted my tooth
The dentist pulled my tooth
Look closely
I detest attending school
I have some awful news for you
They wrote each other a cheque
That sounds more than odd
You have to be able to adapt
You have to be able to fit in

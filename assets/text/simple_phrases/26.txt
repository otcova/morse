Use butter moderately
It was a gaping wound
I returned to my work
That may very well be
Naming things is hard
Talk about the sunset

I wish I had that talent
Let me do what I want
I made the same mistake
No penalty was assessed
The inside is unpainted
This peach tart is tasty

I would bury it in the garden
He always comes at this time
This is her speciality
This is their speciality
She needs to go there herself
She has to go there herself

We could go there together
It was a wig
Ziri started walking away
It started to rain heavily
Just stay away from Rima
Ziri ran up to his room
Ziri came into his room
It was Rima
Ziri found out that Rima left
The siege lasted until August
The town has three cemeteries
Painting is your real calling
Ziri started picking them up
Ziri suddenly barged in
Everything was safe and quiet
Nobody really curtsies anymore
Wisdom is better than strength
Ziri reached for his inhaler
Ziri beat someone up
Ziri needs to come closer
This is your duty
I hope Mary wins
Tom hardly ever uses them
His plan might fail
The situation was impossible
Bless my soul
Children need care
It caused only minor damage
Tom changed his name
Tom had to disappear
This is a piano
Hand over your money
Separate the yolk from the egg
These are conventional methods

The name will remain the same
I have examples that prove it
The proportions were all wrong
The families will be here soon
Every folder contained a photo
The hull of the ship collapsed
A firmware update is available
That would be very kind of you
After the storm comes the calm
Hang tinsel from both branches
There was a hole in the carpet
I was stuck in traffic all day
I forget what gave me the idea
I seem to be developing a rash

Let me tell you a little story
It could be an awful lot worse
But how are you going to do it

The village has a long history
Three fast boats were deployed
The festival is free to attend
All the jazz greats were there

My endeavors were unsuccessful
I finally found it
I never retired
Some are darker
We changed that
There was no fire
I clean forgot it
I ought to travel
Many died in exile
But I was too late
The tactics worked
The journey is the destination
The way is the goal

It is extremely rare
It is in a rural area
Farmers grew potatoes
That gets old quickly

Ziri popped in from the window
Ziri stepped out of the car
Your time will come soon
Ziri is everywhere
Ziri worked his butt off
Tom was given a present
You may go if you wish
Tom seldom goes to the library
It has a metallic luster
It is no longer locatable
Financial success followed
Ziri sat on a bench
The cars were all repainted
Hurry up with those things

That movie was amazing
I was alone at the time

I testified in the afternoon
A cell phone rang
This is breaking news
Ziri brought the books back
Ziri walked into Berber class
Ziri ended up fighting Walid

Ziri pushed the bully away
Just buzz off
Ziri jumped on Rima furiously

Get off of my husband
Get off of my man
Ziri burst in next
Everyone gathered for lunch

Ziri tried to cheer Rima up
Ziri turned the radio up
This is the simplest way

You can eat it raw
There is no reply
Calm them down
Nobody gave it to him
Tom has a very expensive bike
I like both bread and rice
My favorite drink is tea
My favorite drink is black tea
My favorite beverage is tea
My favorite drink is green tea
A cat is sleeping over there
I enjoy mountain climbing
The park has a large pond
The plane is flying south
Aim for the eyes and neck
You can pay cash
Shoot to kill
Aim for the head
This desk is a bit low for me
Indeed
Because everyone does it
We know about Rima
Rima looked like a doll

Money up front
I eat cereal for breakfast
Please bring me a drink
The sink is made of marble
No more beer for Tom
It was a fun party yesterday
But It was a little exhausting
I can write kanji
Hopefully next time though
They ran to the scene

Give us time to prepare
Tom has dyed his hair yellow
The bouncer threw Ziri out
Ziri ended up scolding Rima
Ziri ended up in tears
I asked just in case
No one survived
Nobody survived
It is a necessity
I wish it got colder
You will need gloves

Ziri was falling for Rima
Ziri silently walked away
Ziri came back a week ago
Ziri had all this figured out
Ziri suddenly passed out

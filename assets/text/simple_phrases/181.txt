Give that cat to us
Give me your book
We love trees
This house is not mine
Give the cat some meat
My mum has three dogs
I never looked for you
I made this chair
He writes a letter
She never found out the truth
Your cat is hiding from me
Go and stand next to your car
They never studied in school
We slept on a very long bed
Nobody ever found her cat
It is no good to you
We need to cut costs

They all can drive
All the apples are there
He hid behind the black car
Her bed is next to the wall
This bag is not small
He likes sweet tea
Your cup is on the table
I want some tea without sugar
That room is very long
I bought four new tablecloths
Buy four big potatoes for me
He has large blue eyes
He never helps me out
He needs a cup of sugar
Bring your cup to the kitchen
That is not your cup
I have many Esperanto friends

I hope I see it again
He quit
He resigned
He spent three years in jail
Please follow the school rules

I work
Not trying is failing
The cat is sleeping in a chair
I would like to draw a tree
Stay a while and listen
You will know soon enough
Tom did a sloppy job
Mary goaded Tom to do it
Tom abandoned them
You are absolutely correct
I felt the same way
I do not fear death
Prepare yourself
I can hardly believe it
I must be getting close
He served his king faithfully
I am in your debt
This does not bode well
Tom is a traitor
You are too late

Our new car is not very big
I bought a dog for him
I need to find her
I have to find her
Take the cat to my room
My children are in school
Tom embraces Marie
Learning French is difficult
It was only a nightmare
I build houses out of stone
His last play was a big hit

Make haste
This is a serious setback
This is most unfortunate
You will always be welcome
Tom seems to know the way
You must get going
I must get going
You have done well
It is good to see you
I cleaned out the fridge

I am eighteen years old
Try to act your age
I repeat it by way of caution
There was a shortage of fuel
I have mucous in my stool
There is no profit in worrying
A thick fog delayed our flight
Dense bushes concealed him
Natto is sticky
Ability alone is not enough
I had a cerebral contusion
The farm abuts on the road
Farmhouses have barns
Farmers cultivate the soil
Farmers produce crops
Waves were battering the shore
The waves are high
Waves are beating the shore
The waves are rising
The waves are subsiding
The waves dashed the shore
The sea was white with foam
My water broke
Basho was the greatest poet
Not every horse can run fast
Get down from your horse
A horse is very useful
Get on a horse
Riding a horse is great fun
The horse snorted impatiently
The horse would not move
A horse can run very fast
The horse is a domestic animal
A horse is a friendly animal
A horse runs quickly
A horse is an animal
The horse jumped the gate
Horses are useful animals
The horse is a useful animal
Tie the horse to that tree
I should not have asked you
Stop making a fool of yourself
No medicine can cure folly
I have pain when urinating
I have a urinary problem
Rumors of defeat were abroad
A tall woman came along
A tall man came up to me
That seat reclines further
Straighten up
Carry your head high
The man was of normal height
My back still hurts
I feel a pain in the back
I was kicked in the back
Please wash my back
It is our rainy season
Mr Umemura teaches us English
I have to go shopping
The shoppers stood in a line
Shoppers crowded the streets
The sales are slipping
Sales are amazingly brisk
Sales fell short of their goal
The jury is hung
Keep off the flies
You cannot enter the museum
It is currently under repair
The white parasol is hers
We saw a white ship far away
A white ship came into view
White doves are pretty birds
We have a black and white dog
Her eyes are rolled back
The twilight came on
He exploded with anger
We found all the boxes empty
There are some eggs in the box
There is a doll in the box
Look into the box
I looked into the box
The box was open and empty
The box is empty
But give it a touch
I have a serious skin problem
I have dry skin
I have greasy skin
Your skin is breaking out
The field was rank with weeds
I tried all possible means
I have a skin eruption
My hair has grown out
Just brush your hair
My hair is greasy
She touched her hair
It was wet
I have to comb my hair
The fine shall be paid in cash
Your tooth must be extracted
The pigeon has flown away
The judgement was against him
Half of the melons were eaten
Give me half of it
The noes have it
A rebellion was brewing
A revolt broke out
The revolt was crushed
The wind filled the sails
All the sails were taken down
Boards are used to make floors
The plank froze to the ground
Crime is on the increase
Crime does not pay
The criminal left footprints
It may snow in the evening
He is above all meanness
Too much humility is pride
He is into the Internet
He has a lot of confidence
He will call for me about six
If only he had been there
He will go in your place
Ask her when he will come back
Tell me when he will come
I have never heard him lie
He cannot have told a lie
He is impatient to see you
He broke out into rage
I will go when he comes back
I will start after he comes
I expect him to come
I wish he were here
He always comes at this time
I believe that he comes here
I will go out if he comes here
I observed him come along here
I saw him come this way
He is the master of this house
He laid out this garden
He must have entered this room
It is odd that he is so late
I never saw him in jeans
The wind he gave off smells
It is funny for him to say so
He cannot have said so
What he said is true
Small wonder that he thinks so
He may be there
He was heard singing the song
He may well respect the artist
He is in charge of the class
He made up for the deficit
He made the ultimate decision
He cannot have said that
He designed the car
He designed the new building
He made up the story
He can not have done that
It is evident that he did it
Tell me what has become of him
I have no idea how he escaped
No one could tell where he was
Tell me exactly where he lives
I have no idea where he lives
God knows where he fled
God knows where he has gone
He was naturally very angry
Tell me how he got it
He is anything but a fool
He may well get very angry
I found him lying on the bed
He won the race again
He has not come yet
It is clear that he is guilty
He thought of a good solution
He was a great influence on me
I have heard nothing from him
He wrote to me yesterday
I had a phone call from him
He acted as our guide
He is least likely to come
He is most likely to succeed
I heard him coming downstairs
Guess what he told me
It is clear that he is at home
He broke into a house
I never heard him sing
He sang a song
He is father to the bride
He is commander of our troops
He deprived us of our liberty
I expect that he will help us
I am suspicious of him
We heard him come downstairs
I heard him go down the stairs
He can not have gone to school
He is anything but a scholar
It was a glass that he broke
It is plain that he is wrong
It is certain that he is wrong
Please wait till he comes back
He was elected chairman
His absence was due to illness
He moved into my neighborhood
It is clear that he is rich
The box he found was empty
All that he says is true
Whatever he says is true
What he says is false
What he says is very important
What he said cannot be true
What he said may well be true
What he said then shocked me
What he said is not true
Do tell me what he said
I remember what he said
Everything he said was right
I like him
I understand him to be happy
It is advisable for him to go
It is definite that he will go
I wish he were here now
Make certain where he is now
Sport has made him what he is
His reelection seems sure
He was the first to arrive
He was the first to come
He came to see you yesterday
He is certain to turn up
He is actually not the manager
It was yesterday that he died
The evening he died was stormy
I wish he were on our team
What he told me proved true
He is wrong or I am
He has my fate in his hands
He went in place of me
He chose to have me stay
I saw him looking at me
I know he is watching me
He came to my rescue
He is certain to win the game
His next two books were novels
It is no wonder that he failed
That he will fail is certain
Someone saw him wash his car
I saw him wash the car
He guaranteed my debt
He played an important part
I heard him go out
He is anything but a gentleman
I hope that he will succeed
I led him to expect success
I admit that he is right
I doubt if he is honest
I will answer for his honesty
I found him honest
His honesty is beyond doubt
I am proud of his honesty
Her honesty is beyond question
I answer for his honesty
That he is alive is certain
I vouch for his sincerity
His red face showed his anger
I believe him to get up early
I saw him running
He is justly proud of his son
He batted three runners home
I cannot help his being lazy
No wonder he was arrested
He sent me a birthday card
He run fastest by a long chalk
I saw him enter the store
He must have missed the train
Naturally he got angry
No wonder he is so angry
He was seen crossing the road
He did the work on his own
He was seen to go upstairs
He came to Japan as a child
The door shut after him
It was dark when he came in
He deserves punishment
He or I am to blame
I agree to his marrying her
He may well get angry with her
He told her and she smiled
That he loved her was certain
He cannot have been ill
It is true that he is ill
He fell ill three years ago
He complains with good reason
His face says that he lost
He was seen to enter the room
He burst into the room
I heard him go out of the room
His death was partly my fault
I know he is busy
I know that he was busy
That he was busy is true
He put the idea into my head
I saw him sawing a tree
When he awoke it was day
Wait here till he comes back
He is famous as a good doctor
We know him to be a brave man
I see that he is an able man
Ask him about it when he comes
I expected that he would come
I doubt if he will come
That he will come is certain
He will blow our party
I hope that he will come
I will wait here till he comes
Be waiting here until he comes
He is the very man for the job
He is the very man I want
He is just the man for the job
He is a real gentleman
Only he read the letter
I hate it
I am to meet him at ten
I feel relaxed with him
I dream of seeing him there
I have known him for ten years
I get on well with him
I cannot get along with him
I often went fishing with him
I am in touch with him
He is a childhood friend
Shake hands with him
I feel secure with him
I was happy to see him
It is vain to argue with him
It is no use arguing with him
His ideas conflict with mine
He and I walked together
He and I are cousins
He and I are classmates
He and I can not speak Spanish
He and I stayed at the hotel
He and I are brothers
He and I are teachers
He and I are bosom friends
He and I share a room
I had to meet him halfway
I got to know him
I have known him for two years
I fell into company with him
No one can cope with him
You as well as he are diligent
A gulf divided him from them
Make an appointment with him
I am meeting him next Friday
I want to contact him
I want to have a talk with him
It is no use talking to him
He never listens
He is doing a super job
He can say such things
He could do it
He can be trusted
He deserves a promotion
He is a good match for me
He kept me waiting for an hour
Let me introduce you to him
I threw him a nice ball
I got even with him
I expect much of him
I will make him pay the money
Let him pay for it
I accommodated him with money
He gave me a cold
I had him carry my bag
He is not equal to the task
I want him to read this
Tell him to come here at once
I asked him to do that
I gave him the book
Let him do it
He shall have it
Let him do it alone
Give him plenty of work to do
You can ask him for help
I warned you off about him
Give him a fair half
That is all I know about him
I will tell you about him
Rumors were current about him
Everything went well with him
She is everything to him
He is a bit of a coward
He has a son and two daughters
He has two daughters
I cannot thank him enough
He has no girlfriend
He has a fair income
He is equal to this work
He has no title to this land
He had a lot of work to do
He has a lot of things to do
He is not up to the task
He is competent for the job
He is to blame for the failure

It is right up his alley
He is easy to reach
He had a strong alibi
He has no specific aim
He has another son
He is learned in Russian
He has no friend to play with
He is in want of exercise
He has a genius for music
I have not seen him in months
He is cursed with idle sons
He is free from care
I have seen him many times
He feels the cold very much
I cannot thank him too much
Be on your guard against him
He needs discipline
He has a son of your age
He has managerial talent
He has no sense of economy
I blew the whistle on him
He cannot afford to marry
He is giving me a hard time
He has three brothers
He has three children
He had three sons
He has no children
His thoughts are empty of idea
He had no chance to visit us
I see him once in a while
He has no idea of his own
He has no house to live in
He had no friend to help him
He has not a little experience
He is devoid of common sense
He has no eye for beautiful
He is nothing of a gentleman
He is devoid of human feeling
I met him on several occasions
He has a pension to live on
He has a knowledge of biology
He is mentally handicapped
He has a great sense of humour
He has plenty of quality
I met him about noon
He has natural gifts
He lacks moral sense

He is lacking in courage
He has a family to support
He has no family to support
He has two beautiful boys
He has an inferiority complex
He had no friend to talk to
He gave me a bad cold
He gave me a hard time
It is no use asking him again
Ask if he wants another drink
Ask him to stay a while
I advised him to start earlier
Please bring him his beer
Let him at it
We will let him try
Please say hello to him for me
There is a scandal about him
I want him to sing a song
Give him a piece of advice
His son troubled him most
I took a swing at him
I taught him how to swim
Ask him the way to station
I inquired what he wanted
Forget it
I let him get the credit
I had him carry my baggage
He openly confessed his faults
Let him go his own way
I would like to meet him
I was not able to see him
You may catch him
I remember seeing him
He had the jump on me
I advised him to take a rest
I signed for him to approach
I demanded that he should pay
He shall go to the bank
Let him play your guitar

Ask him to sketch out his plan
Luckily he did not see me
I remember giving him the key
Give him rigid training
Let him say what he will
Let him have his say

I entrusted my property to him
I had him paint my house
I got him to mend my watch

She cooked him meals
I provided him with food
I furnished them with food

Try to keep up with him
I told him not to be late
I wrote a long letter to him
I hope he will live long
I called him up
Please call him up
I forget to telephone him
Please ask him to call me
Let him use the telephone
I felt sympathy for him
I read the letter to him
Nothing comes amiss to him
The judgement went against him
I took leave of him
Grab him
I have business with him
I will have him come
Have him come
It is useless to talk to him
It is no use talking with him
You may speak to him
It would be nice to tell her
His anger is understandable
His idea is superior to yours
His idea counts for nothing
I hit him on the chin
His alibi is above suspicion
His poor dog is still alive
I can hardly hear him

Tell me about him
His concert was unreal
What he did is not wrong
His joke killed me
His jokes are always flat
He is far above me in skiing
His excellent work stands out
His speech went on and on
His speech bored me

The seat of his pants is shiny
His slacks are all wrinkled
He has atrocious table manners
I made a dive for his knife
His tie came undone
He has a bad style
His pride was slightly touched
I felt disgust at his behavior
He is taller than his brother
The odds are in his favor
All of us went besides him
I have no money in my pocket
May his soul rest in Heaven
His son has a gift for music
Nothing replaced his love
His love grew cold
His affection is cooling
His opinions carry weight
I am in accord with his view
Some object to his opinion
His opinion was unimportant
His opinion is for the birds
His view is quite logical
He is humble about his opinion
His opinion was not accepted
His opinion is quite just
His opinion is reasonable

His English is quite good
I can do without his help
You cannot rely on his help
His help has been invaluable

His family works in the fields
I pardoned his fault
His patience reached its limit
Everything about him was grey
His picture got accepted
His pictures are very famous
His appearance deceived me
He has a good school record
Sweat bathed his forehead
His bag was filled with water
Have respect for his feelings
His eyes betrayed his fear
Anger showed on his face
The sweat stood on his face
A rash appeared on his face
His face brightened
His face lighted up with joy
His face was alight with joy
His face was twisted with pain

I slapped him in the face
His wish was realized at last
His wish is to go to America

He painted a picture of a dog
His dog barks at me
Her dog has poor hearing
His dog is his good companion
His study covers a wide area
His studies cover a wide field
I inclined my ear to him
He is not altogether wrong
Everything he says upsets me
I could hardly believe him
Whatever he says is right
What he says is gospel
He is quite right
You must not rely on his word
What he says is true
Pay attention to what he says
I think that he is right
Do as he tells you
Do it like he tells you
Please write down his words
His meaning is quite plain

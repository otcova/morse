This must encourage you
You are wonderful
Please show some consideration
Norway is my new homeland
Give food to the homeless
You fan yourself
I answer the question
Wait in the car
This is no good
Step outside
Snap out of it
Seal the doors
My hand itches
Mary is a pretty girl
Look what I did
Look back there
I love your hat
I have to agree
I have a tattoo
I caught three fish today
Check it out
All the doors are locked
All of us are getting older
Our apartment is too small
I hardly ever call
I rarely talk on the phone
Thank you for your efforts
That guy is batshit crazy
You had dealings with a crook
These are for Tom
That hat looks good on Tom
I kissed Tom
This is real easy
This can be fixed
That game was fun
Mary grabbed her purse
Nobody lives here
It went very well
I want to explain
I needed that job
I have to be here
I have great news
Get me some paper
Get away from that
Come home with me
Come and see this
I bought milk today
Look at that red car
I feel that it will rain
I have had fun
He wants meat
He wants peanut butter
They want paraffin
The city consists of two parts
Greek engulfed the Phrygian
The ice melted in the water
This is just water
I also need a pillow
You can sleep here
My hair is naturally curly
That was a test
You just passed
We only kissed once
And then they kissed
You can sleep here if you want
I wrote a song about you
I wrote a song about Tatoeba
Your hair is cute
I like it that way
And the holiday begins
I saw Joe last Sunday
We apologise in advance
This casino is losing money
Everything has a price
Everybody please calm down
Tom arrived precisely on time
Tom adopted an orphan
It will be dreadfully hot
You look good in black
A book is on the table
Tom is an old footballer
Tom was a footballer
Some books are on the table
What Tom did was wrong
Please take Tom with you
Maybe Tom is dead
It was Tom who hit me
I think Tom just lied to me
I think Tom dyes his hair
I know that you love Tom
Go figure
Tom is prone to mood swings
She has a good memory
She has a good reputation
All my friends call me Tom
This just came in for you
It is already morning
I have a lorry
Mary works at a local hospital
The ink is still wet
The blood was still wet
Sports are stupid
We respect her
We respect him
My hair is still damp
Mary is the maid of honor
Mary is really pretty
Mary is my older sister
Mary is going to have a baby
Please be as brief as possible
My father has a good job
I think Tom is intrigued
I believe you all know Tom
I thought Tom was annoying
I thought Tom would give up
I suppose Tom is still alive
He is worried about his future
My patience has run out
Tom plays in a band
Tom plays in a band with Mary
We liked each other
They were talking about me
None of that was true
I was devastated
My parents are out of town
My parents are out of town
I can read your thoughts
Tom is a famous movie star
Tom craved attention
He tried to manipulate me
It was kind of weird
Try to act natural
I saw Tom the other day
I saw Mary the other day
You need to stop saying that
You barely touched your food
You hardly ate anything
I cry too much
I cried too much
You had me completely fooled
You did all you could do
You did a good job today
You put in too much sugar
You have to trust me on that
The whole world loves Brazil
She is intelligent
You fainted
That troubles me
You need me here
Tom and Mary started to argue
I can do it for you
I can kill you
I do need you
I will fight you
We caught you
I need to win
I have a wife
I remember this
Leave them there
I believed that
I do mean that
I loved that
We need it soon
Bring a shovel
I screamed
I have my orders
I like opera
We chose this one
I see it now
Blow your nose
I got nauseous
I hate moving
That depresses me
That scares me
You can call me
You can help me
We need a maid
I know that look
I had to leave
You knew I knew
Bring the kids
I believe in it
I lied about it
I never liked it
I never saw it
I really miss it
I will stop it
Take care of it
We do love it
I have a husband
I was humiliated
Leave those here
Get me my food
I got expelled
Those men died
I hate calculus
Leave the bottle
Hide that book
I feel blessed
I was to blame
I hate beans
Bring me my bag
I smelled bacon
Tell me what really happened
We are all relatively tired
We like Chinese food
Tom is a software developer
I really need you
No one misses you
Thanks for yesterday
I was totally wrong
I need to know why
I get what I want
I got you a treat
We can trust Tom
I need time to think
We need to stop them
I regret that I did that
I want more than that
I can help with that
We took care of that
I believe all that
We both know that
You deserve that
I have a surprise
Please be specific
I have a solution
I got soaked
You have a nice smile
You need to shave
They rejected your plan
Put some music on
Everything seemed OK
Three is all we need
I want to take a nap
They cost too much
Listen to your mother
Clean up that mess
That does worry me
You abandoned me
I may need a lawyer
I might be home late
I lost my job
Put your back into it
Be quick about it
We have to try it
I have my own house
My father is here
It tasted really good
It was pretty good
I tried to forget
I got all excited
I was not drinking
Put your arm down
Stop looking down
That could take days
I was kidding before
I need to get away
Maybe you should ask
Take a look around
Put on your apron
It was no accident
I was in a great mood
I was in excellent spirits
Tom has mental problems
This is happening
Go only there
Someone is up
The festival is free
You owe it to yourself
It might not even work
Leave the matter to us
I got a parking ticket
I want to be with them
I know it sounds silly
What I need is a shovel
I need to go get ready
You broke your promise
My door is always open
I know who that is now
That was a great movie
You look like a lawyer
I have to live with it
I know how they did it
I no longer need it
That man looks familiar
Do it the best you can
Do the best you can
I just want to go back
I admire your ambition
I want to see them all
That was very generous of you
It could be a lot worse
This is really going well
That really went well
We may not have much time
It looked similar to this
Stop worrying about that
You have our full support
I bought the wrong size
I like my eggs scrambled
I thought you were rude
Mary used to be so pretty
I was working all night
I looked into the mirror
You completely ignored me
Leave the driving to me
Thank you for asking me
Please be quick about it
I think we should do it
I think I know what it is
This is really important
I thought Tom could help
There was a huge explosion
That explains everything
It was the right decision
That was a bad decision
It gets worse every day
You never had a chance
We hardly see you anymore
We can start over again
Tom takes after his mother
Fuji from here
The eggs are in the basket
The fish are in the sea
The wallet is in the bag
The wallet is on the bag
This is tofu
That is tofu
This is my Japanese friend
This is a Chinese restaurant
This is Chinese food
This is not my Japanese friend
Please give me money
Please repeat

I will graduate in two years
This car is not mine
French cuisine is excellent
I am a bit shy
My uncle collects Chinese fans
She likes teamwork
I gotta go
Stay away from my computer
I yelled for help
You have a beautiful house
Leave it right where it is
This is standard procedure
You should both just relax
You have a very nice smile
I probably will do that again
I care for you a great deal
You know it as well as I do
I had no idea you were here
I know exactly how to do it
We have you to thank for it
Children often make mistakes
All you care about is money
I have the same symptoms
You need to help me do this
I have no idea who it was
I hope it stays that way
I just need to find out why
This is never going to work
You have to let me help you
This is my younger sister
I just saw her
You turned off the computer
I need to pee
Tom heard a sound downstairs
Tom has to go to the hospital
Tom has a wonderful voice
I think I found a problem
Just put it back on the desk
Use it with caution
Wipe that smirk off your face
I came from Switzerland
I came from Iran
Melanie works as a translator
Melanie works as a journalist
Tom is no genius
The paradise was in my heart
I had the paradise in my heart
He is noble of heart
The future has many names
Tom has neither cat nor dog
All of this is very worrying
I come on time
I saw Tom the other day
That looks pretty cool
We all need to work together
It fits me just right
None of this was my fault
We could get caught
None of this was your fault
I thought we could be friends
This is just amazing
I touched the bottom
Tom said that he was fine
Mary said that she was fine
I saw some girls bully her
Tom was my first crush
Mary was my first crush
He was my first crush
She was my first crush
Tom is dumb and immature
I stared into his eyes
I love the way it feels
We should go together
We can work that out
This is not war
You CAN do it
You MAY do it
Tom lives life to the fullest
I bought you a gift
She had nice teeth
This will kill that
I warned you he was crazy
This one is free
Smoking shortens your life
I hate horror films
Marie is my best friend
I love your country
I want to stay a few days
The ball hit the crossbar
The ball hit the bar
He never wears a tie
You are in no state to drive
The Germans have won again
They rejected my proposal
Mary used to be beautiful
I always needed some attention
You need to help me find Tom
It looks like Tom will succeed
You owe Tom an apology
Maybe I need a lawyer
You should throw those out
You should throw it out
You should throw it away
You should throw these away
You should throw this away
You should throw those away
This could take a long time
Mary just got her hair done
Mary is really a nice girl
Mary is extremely beautiful

The cow lost its calf
The cow cast a calf
Tom still uses a typewriter

It was a beautiful night
I saw the fear in his eyes
Tell me the truth
Just tell me the truth
You have to tell me the truth
You are so childish sometimes
I found a nice tie for Tom
Mary wore a beautiful dress
You need to move on
I need to go feed the chicken
I need to go milk the cows
Tom is mowing his front lawn
Tom found a Roman coin
Tom found an ancient gold coin
Go back to the lab
It could get messy
It could be risky
It might be risky
The cat is hiding its claws
A bad penny always turns up
All the world loves a lover
Every picture tells a story
Failure teaches success
Faith will move mountains
Fight fire with fire
First things first
It never rains but it pours
Let the dead bury their dead
Man cannot live by bread alone
Never judge from appearances
Speak when you are spoken to
Time cures all things
True love never grows old
Two wrongs do not make a right
You know just as much as I do
You know that better than I do

You could be in over your head
You may not like what you hear
It looks a little heavy
You did what you could to help
You need to get to a hospital
You had no right to interfere
You have no right to interfere
You need to get another lawyer
You are way out of your league
You can change it if you like
You just said it was up to me
You can still change your mind
You need to see a neurologist
You need to get home right now
You need to go home right now
You need to take some time off
You may want to get some rest
Let me be more specific
You have no right to say that
You have to come out of there
You were right and I was wrong
The winter will be severe
That water was so cold
The air was humid
I want to hire a helper
I am thirty
I am thirty years old
He walked her to her car
He took the elevator with her
Tell him you like him
She was excited
Older women give birth later
Baby on board
You told me he did it
No one understands you
Her sons are in the garden
We want to change rooms
This one is too noisy
It was crowded in the car
She likes jelly donuts
A giant wave flooded the canoe
Quitting smoking is hard
Quitting smoking is difficult
No one has time for that
No one wants that to happen
No one knows why we were there
I like sauerkraut
No one asks to be born
He had his way with her
You underestimate yourself
You know how I feel about you
Your guests are waiting
Your time is almost up
You look really nice tonight
You had no reason to do that
You should really go home now
Your room is ready now
You should never do that again
Be careful
It might be a trap
I had no choice but to do that
Slip this into your purse
Get off my property
Let me handle that problem
I love surprise parties
Mary and I are getting married
Thanks for driving me here
Everything looks fine
Please hand me my cane
I need that information now
I added a lot of translations
Today we do not carry swords
It is how the system works
The baby looks like his mother
The baby resembles his mother

You should go help Tom
Tom is sleeping right now
Boston is overrated
Water is good to drink
I need a musical instrument
Do as I ask
I enjoy life
It sure is hot
It sure is cold
Wait till I call
This is too much
This is too hard
The rest is here
The power is out
The play is over
The light was on
The light is off
The door is ajar
That made me mad
Take a step back
Stop in anytime
Stop by anytime
Show me the plan
Pass me the wine
Now look at this
Now look at that
Now listen to me
Now let me think
My leg is broken
Let me try it on
Let me take this
Let me take over
Let me have that
Let me drive you
Let me come over
Lend me a pencil
Kick the door in
It was very nice
It was very good
It sure is tight
It sure is dirty
Help me to do it
Help me find Tom
Have a nice swim
Have a great day
Have a good trip
Hand me a tissue
Get on over here
Get me some wine
Wait for me there
This could be fun
The room was bare
The room was cold
That was too easy
That might be fun
That could be fun
Take care of this
Please let me out
Let me carry that
Keep your coat on
Keep an eye on it
Just wait and see
Just take me home
Just listen to me
It was no trouble
It should be fine
It might not work

Get back in there
Get back here now
Come play with us
Come on over here

Come on back here
This is a good job
It was a very good year
The bus was almost empty
The bottle is almost full
There was no need to do that
This is very wrong
It just might work
It might even work
It might just work
Go around that way
We should wait
Come party with us
They might hear us
This is between us
Just let me get up
Please hurry it up
It was a good trip
Just listen to Tom
Let me go with Tom
This is a bad time
Let me take those
Just hang in there
Put it right there
Now just lie still
Keep very still
It was very simple
It was a good show
Come here a second
Excuse me a second
Just wait a second
Just do what I say
Please do as I say
Lie still and rest
Just try to relax
It sure is pretty
It was a good plan
This is a bad plan
Get your own place
It was hot outside
Just fill this out
The trunk is open
Go ahead and try it on
Go back to bed now
Try not to make any noise
It was really nice
That was very nice
It really is nice
This is all I need
It was a good movie
Excuse me a moment
Just wait a minute
Wait here a minute
I want you with me
Read it back to me
Meet me at the library
There are only three left
Get ready to leave
It may be too late
Try not to be late
It might be worth it
Just let me see it
Leave me out of it
This is most of it
Let me fill you in
It was a good idea
Get off your horse
Just get back here
Just get down here
Just get over here
Perhaps I can help
They may need help
This ought to help
This is all I have
Hand me my hat
This is quite good
It was a fair game
It was a good game
Just let me finish
Go ask your father
It might be enough
The park was empty
The pool is empty
That was very easy
It was hot and dry
Use the front door
I have no idea what to do
It was pretty dark
It was really dark
Get me some coffee
Let me get my coat
The bar is closed
Go home and change
They may come back
I want it back
Have a look around
Come back anytime
Yoga comes from India
Yoga has many health benefits
Peel and dice the onions
Some Asian men wear makeup
All the girls teased me
He inherited the castle
He was never happy
You were just here last week
You need some more practice
You need to get out of the car
He was never content
He almost forgot his money
Birds are chirping
They analyzed the results
Tom aspires to be a teacher
That will be a problem
She lied from start to finish
Tom likes to show off
Mary is an interior designer
Be happy because it happened
He loves that gravy
Let me have a word with Tom
I spent all day home with Tom
This used to belong to Tom
Just make sure you talk to Tom
Please let me go and see Tom
Perhaps I was too harsh on Tom
Never turn your back on Tom
I need to get a hold of Tom
I recently met Tom
Women seem to like Tom
Maybe your name really is Tom
Guess whose middle name is Tom
I need to get away from Tom
I got a call from Tom
This is a message for Tom
I left a message for Tom
The point here is to find Tom
No one is there but Tom
No one will believe Tom
Women throw themselves at Tom
I want an electric fan
I want a fan
I was born in Asmara
You should stop
I guess I should thank you
I hope you can hear me
Stop pulling my hair
Tom got off the train
Tom and Mary are still working
He arrested the criminals
I depend on my reading glasses
That was very careless of you
There may be hope for you yet
Get back in the van
This is all quite unnecessary
What we did was unnecessary
This is all unnecessary
This is really unbelievable
That was pretty scary
It was a little scary
It was really scary
It was a foolish mistake
Send the bill to me
This is our only hope
This ought to be fun
That was a foolish decision
This is a hundred dollar bill
That would be very beneficial
I swept the driveway for you
The surgery went well
This music is making me sleepy
Maybe you should quit
Maybe you should leave
It never snows here
I hope that helped
Everybody looked disappointed
This is kind of cool
That was just a coincidence
I hope it works out
Tom is kind of standoffish
Your instincts are wrong
I should finish unpacking
That was totally uncalled for
They know that I talked to you
We have no idea what to expect
I have to get back to work
Just asking
People are weird
Life is not a fairytale
Christmas always moves me
He avoided eye contact with me
The battle is ours
The day is ours
The battle was over in minutes
It was over in minutes
May the Gods help us
Tom is fond of classical music
He always twists my words
Tatoeba is so fast
Mary is fond of Celtic music
I get tired
This is a mockery of justice
I rest my case
The rest is history
Nuts are nutritious
I feel energetic and happy
I felt guilty and sad
Stop taking pictures
You look like a tourist
My cat is sleeping on my bed
Parties bore me
It fits you like a glove
I like that one better
She begged me to go with her
He begged me to go with him
Mary begged me to go with her
Tom begged me to go with him
Tom is so irresponsible
I saw Tom
He was with another woman
What a dump
Your hair is beautiful
My mum has to spoil things
She likes to drink
The boat is sinking
You would make a great mother
We pitched our tent in a field
Tom is a ruthless businessman
I feel one with the universe
Tell him it was an accident
I wish I had a camera
I never use my camera anymore
Tom stepped on a hornet nest
I knew Tom could do it
I forgot to tell him
I forgot to tell her
I forgot to tell them
Be careful
Oranges are a seasonal fruit
I forgot something in my car
His death was ruled a homicide
The universe is a large school
I need to make a few calls
This is blackmail
The other students laughed
The students all laughed
The class went wild
You should do that by yourself
You should ask Tom yourself
This chair is yours
I parked my car next to yours

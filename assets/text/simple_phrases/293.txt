Go wash the dishes
They moved
They were moving
You can shut up now

Even chocolate has vitamins
Many are against this bill
The sun set behind the forest
Stop playing with your hair

This wine is very expensive
You look alluring in blue

Laughter is a human trait
I told myself to stay positive
I tried that a couple of times

I understand the reason for it
I urge everyone to do the same
I wonder who did that
I told everyone to duck
I wish we had done more
We had a real good time
I tried to warn everyone
I was a bit disappointed
This student is from Japan
The banks are closed Sunday
This is just propaganda
I hope it snows all night
Laughter is a serious matter

I was fortunate to get the job
I was one of the last to leave
I was outside when it happened
She sent me a text
I was really impressed with it
I was really pleased with that
I was reasonably happy with it
I was working when it happened
I went to my bedroom and cried
I wonder if that was the point
I wonder what raccoons eat
I need a laptop for school
I need a table for eight
I need more than your loyalty
I need my prescriptions
I need medicine for my head
My head is heating up
Stay put until I need you
I need soldiers for a mission
I need my powers back now

I want to know the whole truth
I need men of solid stature
I need my passport for travel
I need him alive and unharmed
I need a towel or something
I need that kind of insight
I need finality to my affairs
I need your dating advice
I need to hear from my family
I need news of my family
I need help untying this boat
I need tranquility when I read
I need quiet when I am reading
I can only count on myself
Watch where you put your feet
She is an actor
She was an actor
Tom caught me off guard
I swear this is true
Tom is a total phony
Everybody is unique
I swear to God this is true

This is so beautiful
Wow
You mean everything to me
Mary fought back her tears
You make your own luck
I never see you anymore
Her eyes caught his
His eyes caught hers
He sounded intrigued
She sounded intrigued
Tom sounded intrigued
I need to ask a favor
I need to ask you for a favor
Mental illness is not funny
Paltry as those lives are
You live and learn
I think all cats are wild
Dinner was delicious
Tom beat me to the punch
Tom speaks Irish English
Tom needs the table setting
A real man makes his own luck
This table is wonky
How the other half lives
Feck off
It is very late
My children like school
Now go to bed
This dress is a good buy
I trust my intuition
You had time to think
We heard voices in the room
I still have so much to do
Loud music bothers me
He had his wife painted
I forgot my medications
I think I will buy the red car
Tom showed me a magic trick
I changed only a few words
I auditioned for Arthur Fox

We got caught in a rainstorm
Mary sipped her hot chocolate
Tom is in the ski lodge
Mary looked at me and smiled
Tom rubbed his forehead
I must have drifted off
Go ahead
Tom sipped his hot chocolate
They all began to laugh
I think he really believes it
I think she really believes it
I have to go
Mary stared out the window
Everything was silent
My dress is ruined
Tom slept nearly the whole way
Tom sat in his rocking chair
Tom has a voracious appetite
The cogs are whirring loudly
Tom walked into the signpost
The town is badly signposted
Mary watched the children play

Tom is a diamond in the rough
I can sleep on the sofa
I can sleep on the couch
I like explaining things
Tom started a bar fight
It is in no way an easy job
I need it until tomorrow
There are many familiar words
I am fourteen years old
Hypocrisy is everywhere
He goes to junior high
She goes to junior high
This is just a rumor
Tom looked mystified
Mary is making jam
This is a little bit strange
Mary rubbed her crystal ball
This is a magic broom
This is a magic broomstick
I laughed so hard I cried
There is only one of me
Her eyes got all watery
She cried over his shoulder
He cried over her shoulder
Mary cried in my arms
Tom is an oncologist
I ate my sandwich
I was just venting my anger
I had a sandwich for lunch
Tom walked out of the building
Tom jumped from the boat
Your fiancee is in the lobby
Tom helped Mary stand up
This jam is homemade
Tom took her in his arms
My car is parked outside
Nothing doing
I had it destroyed
Linda will be here
It seemed like a fairy tale
It was like a fairy tale
God works in mysterious ways
It did not go well
John sets the table
Maybe others have better ideas
She smells really nice
These are serious problems
He looks just like an angel
She looks just like an angel
Mary is a midwife
You should ask for a refund
Lost time is never found again
Stop procrastinating
Her parents were devastated
Treat them with respect
Mary pouted her lips
I enjoy the weather
Tom worked as a physio
The tree is secreting sap
The crowd dispersed quickly
Fungi disperse spores
I also work at the weekend
The future scares me too much
The water is flowing
I like your sweater
My house is tiny
The cutlery has disappeared
The cutlery has gone missing
You are being guided
Tom is allergic to MSG
The future scares me a lot
Tom is setting the table
We can still break even
The animals need to eat
I never go to the sea
They sat down next to her
I have no intention to act so
David defeats Goliath in court
I must brush my back teeth
Feel free to call me anytime
I found out that Tom had lied
I only travel first class
See you all then
My son is fond of fish fingers
It ended with fisticuffs
This water is undrinkable
They rigged the football game
I am fixing a meal
Tom has a flair for languages
He likes flamboyant clothes
This car is kind of flashy
The bird flew into the cage
Tom is fond of back massages
For your eyes only
The door is heavy

Unfortunately I am busy
The tickets are free of charge
Now I am full
The flat comes fully furnished
The food was wonderful
Pesto can be frozen into cubes
Let me do the cooking
A dog barked
Mary tilted her head sideways
Try not to laugh
Then you have suitors
She was speechless
He was speechless
It was very stressful
Stay strong
My wish is to become a teacher
I had a shower
I showered
I hate talking about politics
You forgot the accent mark
Tom wrote his Christmas list
I have PTSD
I consulted a doctor
Politics is a dirty business
I am peeking at someone
I want to be young again
They are talking
The cause of death is unknown
I am Australian
My brother studied in England
Christmas is just a week away
I want to see the horses
Your old grandma dances well
Babies have big heads
It was so nice to meet you
Humans have big brains
I look out of the window
They seem very busy
The king protested
You need to eat breakfast
Tom sent Mary a Christmas card
Christmas is here again
I beat you
Tom and Mary made snow angels

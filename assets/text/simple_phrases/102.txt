Tom ate all the cupcakes
You should watch this video
That was very useful to know
Tom is wearing flipflops
He works in archeology
His answer surprised me
He accepted the job offer
He can operate a forklift
He tore the paper in half
He needs to call a doctor
He joined the Marine Corps
He was trained as a doctor
His fever is getting worse
His birthday was yesterday
He stood in line for an hour
He had no reason to be angry
Tom will stay home today
He owns two houses and a boat
He drives a truck for a living
This key should open that door
Tom has misled me
Tom served us Chinese food
I live on the third floor
You cannot eat all the cookies
I have spoken
All that money has been spent
That only happens on Mondays
That seems a little strange
Rents are high in this area
We often drink green tea
That seems foolish to me
Children can get in free
Your band sounded great
The cement is still wet
Do whatever you want to
All the girls know me
Do anything you want
Come again next year
Bears are very smart
Be grateful for this
Australia is my home
Asked about it again
All the boys know me
All are good options
Tom has denied it
We only accept cash
The game was fixed
The match was fixed
The game was rigged
January is over already
Some people fight back
He works as an animal trainer
He studied medicine
He made me a bird cage
He finally quit smoking
He escaped the danger
He broke the glass
Tom and Mary were both angry
It looks easy
It ended badly
It took forever
Stop taunting me
Welcome to club
This happens almost everywhere
This happens almost everywhere
Mine is that one
Go back to Boston
Tom and Mary adopted a child
My family is safe
Please stay tuned
It boggled my mind
Both Tom and Mary were naked
Both Tom and Mary were angry
Its color is brown
Many of us do that
We were so excited
Give me back my cap
Give me my cap back
Its color is yellow
Many people do that
Many people said no
Place your bets now
Quit making excuses
Tom thinks gambling is a sin
Tom speaks slower than Mary
Dress will be casual
Tom sent a picture to Mary
You drive like old people
Education is the key
Go back to Australia
The boot is open
Guess which is which
I know this music
This is too heavy
Help is still needed
You were very convincing
I have a lot of back pain
Security has been tightened
Things have finally changed
Please restart your computer
Things are very expensive here
Things are very cheap here
Here is no different
Hold your heads high
Tom and Mary have children
You have to make it happen
It boggled our minds
Tom and Mary are both tall
It felt like an hour
It happened at night
It happens every day
It happens to us all
Tom and Mary adopted a kid
It makes total sense
It meant a lot to us
It seemed so surreal
It starts from there
It starts right here
Peter is very strict
Both Tom and Mary are tall
It was a close match
It was a fun project
It was a lot of work
It was a real threat
It was a shock to me
It was just terrible
It was just too late
Tom told me he hated Mary
It was nice all week
It was quite a shock
It was so unexpected
It was very dramatic
It was very worrying
Tom sent Mary a picture
Tom and Mary have kids
The ferret is asleep
Tom made Mary mad
Tom went there
I gave Tom the keys
Tom has kids now
No one recognized Tom
Tom has children now
Nobody recognized Tom
Tom sold me a gun
I gave the keys to Tom
Tom told me that he hated Mary
Tom hated everyone
He had a lot of fun at work
He worked illegally
Tom hates everyone
Tom hated everybody
Tom is quite clumsy
I lent Tom my dictionary
I lent my dictionary to Tom
Stop opening those drawers
He shut the door himself
He felt so bad
He talked about stealing
Those guys are stealing my car
Tom suddenly got up
Let me tell you what Tom stole
Tom stole some of my ideas
He offered his assistance
He was doing his best
He really hated that
I think Tom voted for me
I plan to help Tom do that
Tom sold a gun to me
He definitely heard me
She definitely heard me
They definitely heard me
Tom is losing his footing
Tom lost his footing and fell
Tom took his mask off
Tom took off his mask
What Tom said made me laugh
Tom has a good attitude
Tom might need your help
Tom teaches French to us
I hope you Tom gets well soon
Tom was my first patient
I think Tom is going to faint
Tom said he liked his job
Tom said that he liked his job
I think that Tom voted for me
Jobs are needed here
Tom said he liked it here
Tom said that he liked it here
Just forget about it
Just let everyone in
Tom said he liked my song
Just repeat after me
I thought Tom would believe me
Let the mixture cool
No one seemed to recognize Tom
Tom said he prayed for me
Listen to each other
Nobody seemed to recognize Tom
Look a little closer
Maybe you deserve it
No decision was made
The child is petting the cat
No one had any money
Nobody had any money
We had a bad harvest last year
No one recognized me
Tom let me do what I wanted
Nobody knew about it
Nobody recognized me
Nothing is ever easy
Judaism is beautiful
Tom says that he feels fine
One woman was killed
People are dying now
People came en masse
Please send us money
You were duped by Tom
Mary has a beautiful doll
She has a fluent tongue
Sales are still good
Tom wants me to work for him
Your windows are really dirty
I study psychology at Harvard
Take care of my boys
Thanks for your post
That advice paid off
That got me thinking
That got us thinking
That made me curious
That made me nervous
That still haunts me
That was an easy one
That was decades ago
That was good enough
Tom is someone I looked up to
That was great stuff
Tom sang the song I requested
This must end
Tom says he feels much better
Tom speaks French to his kids
Tom got the raise he asked for
Tom is somebody I looked up to
We needed more money
Tom said he loved me in French
Doing that looks easy
You can have this
Here are some reasons
I agree with you both
I found the test hard
It feels warmer today
It happened real fast
It weighed three tons
Tom said that he liked my song
Just let everybody in
Tom said that he prayed for me
No one does that here
Nobody does that here
That makes me nervous
We had a nice dessert
Doing that makes sense
Get your tickets today
Here come the children
I have three questions
I hope they called you
It was a fun situation
It was a good exchange
It was a terrible blow
We invited him to the mosque
Many Canadians do that
He turned into berserker mode
He still works at Microsoft
He likes to work in the rain
He took a nice hot shower
He took a step back
The cop called for backup

That happened at night
He has just moved to Algiers
He happened to be from Algiers
Welcome to Algiers
They should learn Berber
He wrote about Algeria
Everybody here is Algerian
His doctor is Algerian
He can explain that in Berber
He lives amongst Algerians
Berber helped him keep his job
He had Algerian roommates
He was watching Algerian TV
He was reading Algerian novels
That may not be enough
They both want to learn Berber
That means I was right
That was a fatal error
That was all I could see

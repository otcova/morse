I was crazy about that boy
I was just talking to him
I was just talking to her
You have to believe me
This necktie is too expensive
That tie is too expensive
I was just asking a question
I was in a lot of pain
I prefer to read
I prefer reading
She plays the guitar very well
I have tried everything
Tom began to investigate
I was mortified
The taxi arrived in good time
Tom is nuts about squirrels
I have something else for you
I think I might be dead
My luggage is missing
I have much work today
They went on deck
I use this computer
I hope you enjoyed the trip
This concept has many meanings
I willingly eat sweets
It rains incessantly
Tari Ito was found guilty
It will shortly stop raining
This is by no means light work
Please lend me ten cents
I have to clean my teeth
Your friend left the city
We are very drunk
Tom felt alone in the bar
He is a dentist
This meat is good
Tom is ninth at the moment
Tom is now in tenth place
Tom is out of the race
You two have nothing in common
The kids are at school
My husband is at work
Get in the taxi
Your lips are blue
You should go home
You should go home
I splashed my face with water
He gently took her hand
This is what friends do
He bought her flowers
I was sad to lose a friend
I almost felt bad for her
I almost felt bad for him
Boston is where it all began
She never married
She faked her own death
He faked his own death
Try this on
It should fit you
Look at the fire
Tom has a hidden agenda
Tom washed himself
Tom has washed himself
I drink milk
It looked too simple
I am an Uyghur
Mary is intelligent and kind
There was no hot water
She gave him the creeps
I have certain standards
A dog is a loyal animal
Babies need a lot of care
She hid this from her husband
Her head was grey
Her head was gray
I speak Esperanto very poorly
He grew up with his parents
There are people in the house
Someone has slept in this bed
The little girl washed herself
I want to learn Tigrinya
I only had a couple of beers
It was very romantic
Tom won the contest last year
The sand was warm
The sand is warm
Have it your way
My head is killing me
We spent the day at the beach
I like it
I love everything about you
We were all children once
No one ever tells me anything
It was all the rage back then
The guards are coming
I should go
You know that
You are a notorious liar
Tom is not in hospital
He came half an hour late
I have an Asus laptop
He was ready
Cry me a river
Everybody was staring at me
Everybody was staring at him
Everybody was staring at her
I owe her a great deal
I owe him a great deal
We all owe her a great deal
I owe Tom a great deal
Everything has to be perfect
She slept with one ear open
Everything had to be perfect
I asked you a question
This is my favorite fairy tale
You knew that
The tumor was benign
The tumour was benign
Tom came over and helped me
All those things are true
The tumor is malignant
The problem is not this
He always texted me
Peter loved Jane
Tom took a picture
Tom saw the pictures
Get a picture of this
I sent Tom my picture
Tom snapped a picture
We posed for pictures
Let me see the pictures
This is a great picture
Tom showed me a picture
This is a picture of Tom
Tom is drawing a picture
Tom has a lot of pictures
Tom is painting a picture
Tom likes taking pictures
Tom loves taking pictures
Tom showed me his picture
Let me paint you a picture
Look at this picture again
These pictures are amazing
Tom likes painting pictures
Tom showed us some pictures
All these pictures are of me
They all posed for a picture
Tom showed us a few pictures
Send me a picture of yourself
That picture was taken by Tom
Tom handed the picture to Mary
Tom took thousands of pictures
I sat down across from him
I sat down across from her
I bought the book
The cat is writing a book
I loved him so much
Tom sat down across from Mary
Tom called me fat
Tom is short and fat
You sure got fat fast
Tom was too fat for Mary
Tom seems to be getting fatter
Tom is much fatter than Mary
That could be significant
Every word is significant
It was a significant moment
These might be significant
This is a significant change
The stars are too far away
The whole world knows that
I have a Japanese car
Yoke the oxen to the plough
Tell me what you really think
I assume Tom is up to no good
The paramedics are on the way
They are not talking
They went to Boston with Mary
Tom finished his degree
I tried to talk her out of it
I tried to talk him out of it
It sounded too farfetched
We have to close the windows
We have to find another way
We have to clean this up
We have to go back for Tom
We have to wait for Tom
We have to call Tom
We have to stop Tom
We have to get it together
We have to do better next time
We have to stop this
We have to try this
We have to do this
We have to take the stairs
We have to go to school
We have to take the risk
We have to get Tom a present
We have to take precautions
We have to change our plans

We have great hopes for you
We have big plans for you
We have a long day ahead of us
We have reason to be upset
We have a big day tomorrow
We have a lot of fun together
We have a lot to live up to
We have a meeting to get to
We have limited space
We have a hostage situation
We have a lot to offer
We have great news
We have plenty money
We have some decisions to make
We have a right to know
We have hard jobs
We have three hours
We have no way of getting home
We have a fighting chance here

We have a lot of fun
We have nothing else to eat
We have a lot of things to do
We have no idea what Tom did
We have very little in common
We have a plane to catch
We have a train to catch
We have some tough times ahead
The old lamp gave a dim light
Sad movies always make me cry
We got married very young
We came here looking for you
We know this is hard for you
We think this belongs to you
We just wanted to help you
We can manage without you
We had big plans for you

We always treated you well
We went over this last week
We need to get to the wedding
We found the murder weapon
We can stop whenever we want
We should take a walk
We went for a walk
We looked at the video
We brought it with us
We may not be able to catch up
We were just finishing up
We can look it up
We just signed up
We just broke up
We all watch way too much TV
We saw them on TV
We saw you on TV
We were going to try
We should take a trip
We could use a tow
We just kind of lost touch
We need to find Tom tonight
We were trying to protect Tom
We were trying to help Tom
We just have to find Tom
We seem to have lost Tom
We were looking for Tom
We tried to stop Tom
We tried to warn Tom
We need to stop Tom

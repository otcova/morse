I fear not
Ziri managed to get up
Melissa has a fever
Attention all unities
Ziri rushed into the cave
Ziri got into the shower
Nathalue knows what is good
He pets the horses
The storm was closing in

Ziri began turning to dust
Ziri pushed Rima backward
Ziri made it towards the exit
Ziri appeared behind Rima
Ziri was killed horrifically
Ziri turned around slowly

Ziri went out with a girl
Ziri pushed Rima hard
Ziri saw Rima walk in
We are here to finish the work

A bag came flying at Ziri
We can not see the future
He drew with black ink
We go to the city to purchase
You think a lot about it after
I only feel myself
She pets the horses
He is very wise
He will be sorry for that
Her garden is really small
We have sport lessons
Maria eats
He was very friendly
I wish I had known her earlier
The girl was silent
The girl was puzzled
We are outside your house
Tom has bought flowers
Tom has bought bread
Tom has bought something
Tom wants to be done with it
The knives are in the drawer
My cat is on my lap
All you do is suck up to Tom
We need a substitute for Tom
We live on an island
I will personally commit to it
Time to admit it
She wandered from town to town
I need a sharper knife
I would really like to see you
I showed Tom everything
That may be a possibility
That was a very exciting game

Tell me your lowest price
Tom seems cool
Tom thanked me
I can go today
Tom is now an orphan
Tom and Mary are now orphans
Good to see you again
Tom needed the dough
Look what Tom gave me
Your notes are illegible
I need to look for my agenda
The referee called a foul
I forgot to make my bed today
I think that will be enough
He cut a fine figure
Those towels should be clean
That towel should be clean
This kitchen is filthy
It makes no difference now
I was a fresher last year
Tom speaks French rather well
Ziri grew up in a tiny house
Ziri spent money on Rima
Your presence is required
Ziri threw a fit
I was treated with respect
Ziri stood up and left
Ziri lived next door to Rima
Rima left Ziri for money
Ziri is paying the price
Ziri went into hiding

I often catch colds in winter
She easily catches colds
Ziri is such a jerk
Ziri went to his house
Ziri lost his patience
Ziri got a bad mark
Ziri turned his back on Rima
Ziri was in a terrible mood
This lift is out of order
Please use the stairs
Rima had a poor boyfriend
Ziri took his revenge on Rima
Ziri loved attention
Ziri jumped down from the roof
Ziri believed that stupid lie
Ziri rose up to the roof
Ziri is a saint
Ziri is a good listener
No one is at home
No one was in
Ziri started losing his mind
Ziri hit his head on a rock
Ziri was lying on a couch
Tom is cross with us
Ziri was the village hero
I have to stay at home
I have to stay at home today
I forgive you
Rima was a real beauty
Ziri was sitting in a cafe

Rome is where the pope is
Rima wore a Gucci dress
It was time to go to the party
Ziri already knows Rima
Ziri is not a loser anymore
Ziri has to drink champagne
Ziri was serving tables
Ziri parked in the wrong place
The service there sucks
The vote was rigged
The election was rigged
He comes from Switzerland
Choose your friends carefully
Ziri deserves an oscar
The cop let Ziri go
Ziri went to the sea
Ziri looks like a local
Ziri urgently needed money
Not much time passed
The weather is a bit chilly
The weather is a bit fresh
Please wipe the table off
Money made Ziri so arrogant
I always need it
Ziri brought the money
Ziri forgot his wallet
Ziri had no money
Ziri came here for business
Then he got an awesome idea

Ziri breathed a sigh of relief
Ziri took away the phone
Ziri already had some fans
Ziri hates this place
Ziri searched for Rima online
We missed a golden opportunity
I am not really rich
The thief has confessed
I trembled in fear
I live in the restaurant
The bolts are tight
We shall all fulfill our duty
I do not like conflicts
He had no snow chains with him
Some teachers take drugs
Tom was covered
I wonder if he ever smiled
Tom is an imaginary patient
The bomb is on alert
Shake the medicine to mix it
I came home with empty hands
The letter is not signed
We cannot miss your help
It is identical
I do not spit on you
We went along a small path
It was then fashionable
He has went back up
They are probably in love
Tom lit candles in his room
His legs are smooth
I shoot fast
She has just stated a fact
The situation is disturbing
You should investigate that

This is my dream
You should have called first
Thank you for the overview
These plants need water
This hurts a lot
That hurts a lot
This stings a lot
That stings a lot
The door is wooden
His reply was evasive

The sink is pink
It was just a game for Tom
Escape is impossible
You need to eat well
My dog is swimming in the pool
Tom blocked me
Tom blocked me for that

The test result was negative
You prayed
We pray every day
They pray every day
Do not be unreasonable
I want to see the number
Stay informed
They are still minors

I added too much water
Wake me up if anything happens
My mic was off
My microphone was off
I heard Tom got injured

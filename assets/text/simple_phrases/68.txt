Tom is the star of the team
This is our turf
This song resonates with me
You and I were also invited
Good morning Yanni
Yanni disappeared in Canada
Trust me
Algerian food is good
Yanni is fluent in Berber
Hate me
You just ran a red light
You should request a refund
This cookie is delicious
Tom is a very respected artist
You must learn to fight back
This is not worth much
Tom looked terribly frightened
You knew what you were doing
You should get it changed
Tom will be our guide
You left me almost nothing
Tom has a gun
Let me buy you this
Algeria is one and indivisible
You need to think about it
I understood
Tom was shaking with anger
Both of them left
Tom suffers from narcolepsy
I accepted immediately
Tom has a really cute kitten
I hope you rethink it
You can stay with me for now
You should go get some rest
Today I drove to work
I like being sarcastic a lot
Tom helped me with the dishes
She sets the table
I am not killing them
I looked into the water
You have to wait a while
Tom will get there by bike
I hardly remember anything
You can stay with us for now
We felt isolated
We feel isolated
We can figure this out later
We live isolated
Tom has been outside all day
You should look for a new job
Tom has a terrible attitude
You may continue talking
You know exactly what I like
Tom is arguing in bad faith
You were very young then
Tom asked us to leave at once
Tom eats too quickly
Tom was paralyzed for a moment
We will win
You have to turn round
You have to turn round
Amphibians have lungs
It shuts at half five
It shuts at half past five
There you go
The library is down this road
She has more books than I have
I eat less than you
You eat more than I do
You eat more than me
I started a new book yesterday
Yesterday I started a new book
It took less than an hour
I have less than you have
I have less than you
I have fewer than you have
I have fewer than you
Your mobile was off
Your mobile was switched off
Your phone was off
Your phone was switched off
He has just left
He went by bus
She went by bus
We went by bus
They went by bus
The car is silver
That car is silver
Mary is sitting on the chair
We go to the park
She is listening to music
My friend is a teacher
My girlfriend is a teacher
My boyfriend is a teacher
Mary has a question
She goes by ferry
They eat ice cream
The fruit is fresh
The veg is fresh
The vegetables are fresh
The bread is hard
This bread is hard
That bread is hard
This is tea
You can go alone if you want
I can hardly see anything
We could die at any moment
You may leave if you like
You have to be very strong
Tom is an old sea dog
This apple is for Tom
You said you were scared
You said you were afraid
I have a pet tarantula
We planted too many carrots
This is unlikely to please Tom
You can see better from here
You look good with glasses
Tom is suspected of stealing
Tom has a dirty conscience
I had a dream about you today
Tom clearly knows something
Tom will arrive Monday morning
You did everything correctly
You know all my jokes by now
Wait here with everybody else
Go ahead and smoke
I asked you not to tell Tom
I miss home
That plant needs shade
I can never get Tom to laugh
Shut up and drink
You did that pretty well
Tom wanted to be a musician
You should already be asleep
You should clean your room
Tom confessed his ignorance
You have to decide quickly
Tom left without noticing me
You should get it if you can
You just have to help me
You were just out of luck
I feel reluctant and upset
Tom studied art in Boston
I know this is wrong
Tom will come to see me off
You have failed once again
The kid is playing on the lawn
Tom wants us to come see him
We learn Chinese
Do the laundry
Finish your task
Wash the clothes
Easier looking than doing
You can come when you want
He is more skeptical than I am
Better to earn than to inherit
I will phone you later
Bet you want to hang yourself
Tom left me a short message
The village is big and green
Yanni used to be a Christian
Yanni is a born Muslim
Yanni is talking about Islam
Reach out to other Muslims
Yanni is not at home
We decorated the mosque
This mosque is so beautiful
Yanni went to the mosque
Tom was still alive
They decorated the mosque
Yanni watches Islamic shows
Yanni watches Islamic channels
These roses smell of butt
You must take this seriously
Tom plays in local jazz clubs
I am deaf
Yanni is an autist
Listen to this
Stop trying to provoke Tom
Let Tom do his thing
Skura bought a dog
You may not pass the exam
Tom has never won against me
No
Fine
You have to choose one thing
Yanni is studying to be a vet
Big deal
You should go home and rest
I know that I have to
I have you
She always puts on diapers
I really wanted to marry Tom
I need to put air in my tires
You never gave it back to me
He got dressed and went out
Make sure you lock the doors
You took too long to react
Tom is a skilled investigator
See if you can do it
This happens too often
This happens way too often
We left our children at home
Tom is really bad at geography
You seem to be in trouble
We should tell Tom what to do
It was completely dark inside
The soil is moist
The plants need watering
Please stay nearby
Our house burned to the ground
Be careful
Tom is behind you
This church is very big
You can eat that flower
That flower can be eaten
Go get some firewood
The building collapsed
My sister was waiting for me
You need to get this fixed
Tom seemed to be mad at me
They did nothing to save Tom
Give Tom some peace and quiet
You slept almost all day
Julia wants to fly to America
The cat is catching a mouse
He wants to buy a chain
The farmer works on the field
The child plays with its ball
Tom never really loved Mary
Society is always changing
You should go take a nap
Let me feed the dogs
You have to trust yourself
Your headlights are on
He has got all tasks correct
The cat sits in the garden
The nut is hard
You must help him
She constantly needs to laugh
My uncle lives in Keitum
Tom spanked her
The ship lies in the harbour
He is ready soon
I was faster
She has a lot of patience
He is sitting on the tree
The boy is big and strong
We stay at home
The book costs four coins
Please give me an apple
Please switch on the light
We are building a house
You can go see for yourself
She picks some apples
The rabbit eats the cabbage
He is gifting her a ring
Next to the oven it is warm
Tom is an accomplished diver
You should go and lie down
You managed to surprise me
Tom is Bulgarian
Tom has a phenomenal memory
You left us almost nothing
You were my best student
I believe Mary
You can figure it out later
You should give it a try
Tom made a sketch of the apple
You have failed again
Go ahead and talk
Tom likes tea
Mary likes coffee
You only have one more wish
The fishbowl is like our Earth
You should be here tomorrow
Just buy them
She admired her
He admired him
We were too different
Tom took the initiative
He was too flummoxed to reply
He was too gobsmacked to reply
He was too astonished to reply
A meteor lit up the night sky
We held our breath
We were holding our breath
Three people are coming
Not every family has a garden
It suddenly went very quiet
She can go if she wants
He knew none of those present
We have helped them
This wood must be protected
We rarely met each other
We seldom met each other
We assumed so
He held his feelings back
He held back his feelings
His mood improved
A gentle rain was falling
A gentle rain fell
It was raining gently
It was raining softly
They are not at all alike
There will be other times
Tom is somewhat like my father
You never called me back
She eats sweets
He eats sweets
The apple is in the bag
Tom tried to keep his cool
You can be proud of that
Sorry
Sorry
You can stay if you want
Good managers are hard to find
Good friends are hard to find
True friends are hard to find
Good drummers are hard to find
Jobs are hard to find now
Good leaders are hard to find
Tom pressed the button again
The ceiling is very low
The box is here
Tell me about the party
These are my shoes
Tom handled the situation well
I know a lot about grammar
This coat might fit you
Memorize this poem
You only made one mistake
Let me pay for the pizza
I really want some biscuits
Stop acting the maggot
I grew up in the countryside
Unhand me at once
You were being a bit pushy
It took a while to get here
I have a box of washers
You can just keep it
I spent all day reading
Food arrives in an hour
I just met up with Tom
Please ask Tom where he went
Skura purchased a weapon
All faces look alike to Tom
Let me make some coffee
Tom performs in bars and pubs
I have no quarry with you
Salmon swim upstream to spawn
It was a total fluke
Tom met his demise in Boston
Shut your trap
You are the light of my life
You need to hear this now
You took too many chances
I left work early today
Mary was modestly dressed
I had a big day yesterday
My nerves are frayed
Everybody was having fun
Nobody was having fun
No one was having fun
I can build a house for you
Tom is an altruistic person
That noise was deafening
You have to be ready to go
No one said life was fair
No one said that life was fair
Nobody said that life was fair
Tom drives a red truck
Tom likes to photograph food
You have beautiful brown eyes
You can talk freely here
You should keep an eye on Tom
Tom bought the cheaper one
I slept almost all afternoon
Tom was very obedient
You always spoil everything

Your dog is drooling
I enjoy fishing with Tom
I know the matter well enough
You need a change of scenery
I know enough about the facts
I know the facts pretty well
I know enough about the matter
I know the matter pretty well
You might be the next victim
The pallid moon is waning
Skura has a maid
Tom turned and looked at Mary
You can go tomorrow
Tom told me where to find Mary
Algeria is half a world away
We came back in a hurry
Tom forgot to lock his door
They barely managed
You just have to help them
Tom is a very talented person
Tom is looking for his pencil
You already know my story
I want to do it by myself
I think it looks good on you
Let me carry you
You told me that yourself
I have various projects
Tom brought it to us yesterday
Let me buy this for you
I changed the sentence
Tom did everything he wanted
You definitely have talent
Tom brought me a slice of pie
Tom broke his promise to us
You guys look very confident
You did everything right
We need a change of scenery

We discouraged the students
You promised to call back
Tom may not have locked it
You made a funny mistake
Tom was baptized last week
It was a deadly hailstorm
Tom was hited by a huge hail
No one knows why Tom did this
Tom no longer knows who I am
You have to say it clearly
I would like another car
The weather has changed
My friend has broken his arm
Tom now has a beard
You need to get enough sleep
I bite the dog
The wolf has bitten Maria
Both agreed to my suggestion
You must have a lot of money
The tea is very bitter
Remove the handcuffs from Tom
The boat was big
I like to eat beans
I like the colourful dress
The meadow was colorful
The laundry is not dry yet
Warmth is good for my pain
Tom had forgotten how to blink
The jacket is too wide
The sausage is too fat
That is a beautiful drawing
I read the newspaper sometimes
I read the paper sometimes
Tom wishes to remain anonymous
You need to make an effort
You need to call a doctor
Tom may not have been lost
He is standing on the roof
You made several mistakes
Our windows are not tight
There is always a draft
A thief has stolen my bag
My son is too thin
He eats too little
The jacket is too tight for me
The teacher was always serious
You always have me to blame
They have caught the thief
We have guests this evening
We need a fork
I can not feed the animals
Let me open the door
Let me talk to Tom about this
Tom confessed to us
You can go alone if you like
We can play volleyball here
You did everything wrong
Tom is more than just a friend
You can do this without me
You look like a farmer
Tom always eats the same thing
Tom wants to become a farmer
You got it all wrong again
Tom says yes to everything
Tom was only wearing a towel
You should thank me for that
You have to mow the lawn
You have to learn to listen
Tom bent down and kissed me
Mary bent down and kissed me
You promised not to do that
You talk like my mother
Stay here until I get back

He can go with me
She reads books every night
The garden is full of holes
Tom went out on the balcony
I earn the same as you
All the kids are awake
Spend as much as you want
My arm is broken
I cut the crust off the bread
I want to save more money
Tom gets upset when he loses
He speaks of liberty
He stopped hunting
Mom is playing tennis
This shoe is too small for me
I love dreaming when I sleep
The green team lost
The cake is so sweet
My mom brought me a present
You should follow this rule
That was a smart move
That bread is freshly made
The manager is nice
You have to tell it to him
It rained recently
Talk as much as you want
I did it without realizing
Tell us to our face
I gave it away to him
The flowerpot is decorated
I finished eating lunch
Bend your knee
At least half must vote
Wait
I need to buy your ticket
I want to dance with you today
This makes me feel good
I see flamingos everywhere
Castille is full of castles
Say it to my face
I had to study yesterday
Stop crying already
My tooth hurts
I want to suffer less
You may leave your shoes on
Tom helps me on the farm
I meant well
I had good intentions
I was the victim
Heat makes me weak
You have to forget about it
The valley was long and steep
She is chubby
He is a miser
She is a miser
Tom called me by my first name
The way is very wide
The pillow is too soft
It is very windy today

I wish I had a steady income
Tom is doing fine without us
It happens on occasion
Tom has observed it many times
I spent all day in the garden
I really wanted that job
This has to be done today
Tom looked at Mary skeptically
Tennis is her hobby
That was a gift from Tom
Tom has a chicken farm
We need a lot of people there
I do that from time to time
I do that off and on
I do that every now and then
I better stop thinking then
I should just stop thinking
My French is not that good
I should just stop now
Boil some water

Tom will be our scapegoat
They put on those glasses
Tom stepped over the toolbox
I am going to the market today
Please show me what you bought

Give Tom a call and tell him
It would help if you did that

The Algerian army is skilled
Let me take you to the door
They have one child
She adored him
I got so much candy

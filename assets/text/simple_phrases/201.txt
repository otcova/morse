Those things disgust me
Three bulbs have burned out
Three pages have been torn out
Three shots were heard
Tighten this screw
We ate together at the club
We bought some tennis balls
We can still get there on time
We have to lighten the load
We have to notify the police
We heard the church bells
We need an iron bar
We saw the car start
We were seated in a circle
What he did was an outrage
You have butterfingers
You have to hold back
You must do it this way
You very nearly guessed it
Your criticism is unfair
Your friends are in there
Your screams frightened me
Your watch gains time
He was given an evasive answer
Tom is not so bright
Our team lost the first match
Tom tends to the horses
The grooms tend to the horses
They cleaned the stables
She cried herself to sleep
My family is very proud of me
There is a better way
He was outraged
They were outraged by his lies
They met in secret
They were caught smoking
He was devastated
She was devastated
He talks to me a lot
She turned white
He kissed my hand
He kissed my neck
She eats chocolate every day
She loves ice cream
She looked quizzically at him
I acted without thinking
He acted without thinking
She acted without thinking
This is so dumb
A month is too little time
She wants to be an actress
She was my only friend
Use two fingers
He was my only friend
Use anything you have at hand
He has a square jaw
That is just what we need
The rest is rubbish
I burst out laughing
She burst out laughing
He burst out laughing
She finished the marathon
He did not finish the marathon
I need a woman in my life
Take what you want
The stakes were high
Things are not looking good
The school year is almost over
I can barely pay my rent
This is a violation of the law
She did not cry
He did not cry at her funeral
She started to cry
He started to cry
The landlord changed the locks
Everyone is talking about it
She has braces
He has braces
Brace for impact
Your cat is overweight
Your cat is fat
I prefer dogs
You will be assimilated
We are the Borg
I could use some help
Time travel is impossible
Tom can explain
Tom has seniority
Tom is elsewhere
Tom moved closer
Tom is quicker
Tom is unconvinced
Tom just watches
Tom never confessed
Tom seems unperturbed
Tom committed suicide
Tom got married
Tom greeted everyone
Tom is cooking
Tom is gone
Tom knows now
Tom leaned forward
Tom makes furniture
Tom said no
Tom stepped outside
Tom stepped away
Tom stumbled backwards
Tom walked inside
Tom walked on
Tom walked out
Tom wandered off
Tom was mad
Even Tom is listening
Even Tom knew that
Even Tom knows that
Even Tom looked annoyed
Even Tom looked surprised
Even Tom said something
Even Tom thinks so
Everybody but Tom laughs
Everybody calls me Tom
Tom imitated Mary
Everybody wanted Tom dead
Everyone called me Tom
Everyone except Tom left
Everyone left except Tom
Everyone gathered around Tom
Everyone is watching Tom
Everyone knows about Tom
Everyone laughed except Tom
Everyone but Tom laughed
Everyone pointed at Tom
Mark has more money than you
The human mind is magnificent
Love is stronger than death
Give me something to sign
Be careful
Be careful
Be careful
Be careful
Be careful
Bend down
The ceiling is very low
I have to set my watch back
Make yourselves comfortable
We have plenty of time
Please hurry
Put your watch ahead
Stop joking
Wake up
Time travel is possible
I am very sad that he has died
Get Tom down here
Get Tom in here
Get Tom on it
Get word to Tom
Give it to Tom
Give this to Tom
Give Tom a chance
Give Tom a drink
Give Tom a hand
Give Tom my best
Give Tom my thanks
Give Tom a tissue
Give Tom his change
Go and fetch Tom
Go and see Tom
Have Tom do it
Have Tom join us
Here comes Tom now
His name is Tom
I agree with Tom
I almost called Tom
I always liked Tom
I apologize for Tom
I asked for Tom
I asked Tom out
I barely knew Tom
I brought Tom here
I brought Tom home
I call him Tom
I called him Tom
I called Tom today
I called Tom yesterday
I came for Tom
I came with Tom
I can handle Tom
I can help Tom
I can take Tom
I care about Tom
I checked Tom thoroughly
I checked with Tom
I disagree with Tom
I followed Tom there
I forgot about Tom
I heard about Tom
I heard from Tom
I hope Tom knows
I just saw Tom
I just told Tom
I know about Tom
I lied to Tom
I listened to Tom
I live with Tom
I look like Tom
I looked at Tom
I must find Tom
I must see Tom
I never harmed Tom
I never met Tom
I now represent Tom
I owed Tom nothing
I saw Tom again
I saw Tom die
I saw Tom earlier
I should tell Tom
I spoke to Tom
I spoke with Tom
I started dating Tom
I still love Tom
I talked with Tom
I think Tom knows
I told Tom that
I trust Tom completely
I was expecting Tom
I was quoting Tom
I was watching Tom
I was with Tom
I watched Tom die
I will inform Tom
I will stop Tom
I work for Tom
I work with Tom
I worked for Tom
It could be Tom
It looks like Tom
It might be Tom
It must be Tom
It smells like Tom
It sounds like Tom
It was for Tom
It was from Tom
It worked for Tom
Just let Tom go
Kiss Tom for me
Let go of Tom
Let me call Tom
Let me handle Tom
Let Tom carry it
Let Tom come aboard
Let Tom do it
Let Tom do that
Let Tom do this
Let Tom go home
Let Tom have fun
Let Tom have it
Let Tom live
Let Tom stay there
Let Tom talk first
Let Tom try it
Let Tom walk away
Maybe Tom can help
Maybe Tom did it
Maybe Tom is right
Maybe Tom threatened Mary
Maybe Tom was right
Nobody talks about Tom
Perhaps Tom is guilty
Perhaps Tom was correct
Perhaps Tom will leave
Put Tom to bed
Somebody killed Tom today
Someone is watching Tom
Someone turned Tom in
Take it to Tom
Tell us about Tom
That looks like Tom
That made Tom pause
That made Tom smile
That sounded like Tom
That sounds like Tom
The guard grabbed Tom
Tom drove Mary home
Tom sent me there
They smiled at Tom
They stared at Tom
This is for Tom
This is from Tom
This is Tom calling
Tom accepted the apology
Tom accepted the challenge
Tom accepted the inevitable
Tom actually likes me
Tom adjusted his tie
Tom agreed to go
Tom agrees with me
Tom agrees with you
Tom almost fell down
Tom already told me
Tom always liked me
Tom always said that
Tom always says no
Tom always says that
Tom and Mary agree
Tom and Mary disagree
Tom and Mary survived
Tom hit me
Tom is mad
Tom is serious
Tom is terminal
I love my country
I love my country too
I arrived three days ago
I just arrived yesterday
My luggage has just arrived
Our bus arrived a little early
Our guests are arriving
The cavalry has arrived
The courier just arrived
Tom and Mary are just arriving
Tom and Mary have arrived
Tom and Mary have just arrived
Tom arrived by car
Tom arrived early this morning
Tom arrived eight days ago
Tom arrived exhausted
Tom arrived on foot
Tom has arrived in Boston
Tom has arrived
Tom has finally arrived
Tom has just arrived
Tom has not yet arrived
We arrived a little late
You arrived just in time
I feel terrible about that
I feel terrible about this
I made a terrible mistake
I really feel terrible
I thought they were terrible
I was in terrible pain
I work terrible hours
It must have been terrible
It was a terrible mistake
It was a terrible scene
It was a terrible tragedy
My French is terrible
That movie was terrible
That must have been terrible
That was a terrible joke
The food here is terrible
The weather is terrible
This food is terrible
This is a terrible mistake
This milk tastes terrible
This music is terrible
Tom committed a terrible crime
Tom did a terrible thing
Tom did some terrible things
Tom has a terrible secret
Tom is a terrible father
Tom is a terrible farmer
Tom is a terrible roommate
Tom is a terrible salesman
Tom is a terrible singer
Tom is in terrible danger
Tom made a terrible choice
Tom made a terrible decision
We all feel terrible
We had a terrible fight
We had a terrible time
Your French accent is terrible
My shoulder really aches
Prepare your men
I will always be there for you
I never get invited to parties
It could happen to anybody
It rained for many days
Rabbits can swim
No one went near him
It was the Antichrist who came
He has a Southern accent
She was horrified
You broke her heart
I broke her heart
I broke his heart
I think I broke his heart
He asked her to the prom
This is messed up
I feel bad about it
Sit down and shut up
I just want to snuggle
That could happen to anyone
I like Korean food
Shoichi turned pale
Sheep fur is fluffy
I thought that whales are fish
Thanks for the lift
Thanks for the drink
Add it to my bill
Add up this list of figures
Add water to the soup
Aim higher
Allow me to help
Come and see me afterwards
Come any time after nine
Go ahead and write your letter
He acted on your suggestion
He agreed to your terms
He forgot it again
He leads an active life
He made a frank admission
He will come of age next year
I admire his wit
I feel more dead than alive
I was admiring the view
I was here two months ago
Lean it against the wall
Now is the time to act
Set the alarm for six
She affects a foreign accent
She had a very unhappy affair
That was a very kind act
The coffee is all gone
The police are after him
These houses are all alike
This child has been adopted
Try once again
Wait until after I come back
Walk across the bridge
We have agreed on everything
We treat all visitors alike
You have an advantage over him
A free port was established
A hint from you is enough
A man came to see him
A Mexican taught him Spanish
A solution had to be found
A stranger approached him
Admission is free
Admission will be free
All the supplies ran out
Annoying people irritate me
As you like
At least try to come on time
Avoid bad company
Be careful going down
Be careful with him
Be careful
Be careful
Black is depressing
Boil those potatoes
Business has improved
Buy six meters of that cloth
By no means will I accept it
Call a policeman
Chess is a very difficult game
Cold numbs the limbs
Come at eleven without fail
Conciseness is a virtue
Consider the problem again
Control yourself
Count your change
Cover it with a plate
He has a short attention span
I stared at him in confusion
The critics shot us down
Every culture has a dark side
Let me check my Rolodex
Time is on our side
I was very angry
To err is human
Blaming someone else is wise
It is a result
Gay marriage is legal here
You should stop smoking
Divide this in half
Do it just like this
I know you
Draw a line here
Everyone believed his lie
Everything is going very badly
Everything remains as it was
Explain your idea more clearly
Express your idea concretely
Faithfulness is a virtue
Fill out the application
Four plus three is seven
Gasoline is scarce around here
Give him my regards
Give me an example
Hand me the letter
Hang your clothes here
Have them come in right now
He accepted reluctantly
He acts like a tough guy
He appeared thinner every day
He arrived as soon as he could
He arrived late
He arrived rather late
He arrived with me
He became a Catholic
He became furious
He became rich overnight
He began to raise his voice
He behaved in a strange manner
He behaves very naturally
He boasted of his courage
He bought a box of candy
He bowed his head
He called off the trip
He carried a bundle of clothes
He changed his mind daily
He confessed all his sins
He confessed his crime
He controls himself admirably
He cut down on drinking
He dances gracefully
He deceived his friend
He decided to become an author
He deserved to be hanged
He devotes himself to his work
He did his work painstakingly
He did it absentmindedly
He did it at his own risk
He did it in good faith
He did it without malice
He died last year
He disclosed his intentions
He dislocated his arm
He does everything carelessly
He does his duty
He drank it in one gulp
He dressed very modestly
He envies all his friends
He fell when the ladder broke
He gave an accurate report
He gave away his whole fortune
He gave extravagant tips
He gets along all right
He glanced at the book
He gorged himself on ice cream
He got all he wanted
He got his doctorate
He got into bed
He got married three days ago
He got rich quickly
He graduated from Harvard
He graduated from law school
He had a stroke
He had a wonderful memory
He had to pawn his watch
He had to pay the damages
He has a long neck
He has a strange name
He has a strong constitution
He has a talent for acting
He has a terrible hangover
He has no pity for anybody
He has no servants at all
He has only four pesos
He has two boys and a girl
He has very bad luck
He has very regular features
I am not myself anymore
Give her a hug
Give him a hug
Elephants are majestic animals
I agree with you on that point
I beg you to do it carefully
I bought a set of table linen
I came down with measles
I can do this myself
I have an engagement
Please give me the music
I did it quickly
I do exercises in the morning
I do things in my own way
I earn my living as best I can
I forgot the key to my room
I gave my word
I get up early
I go to the movies every week
I got a thorn in my finger
I got rid of my jewels
I got what I wanted
I had to pay a high interest
I have a class every other day
I have a good job
I have a thorn in my finger
I have a vague recollection
I have a whole lot of ideas
I have just three dollars left
I have less than fifteen
I have no funds in the bank
I have the ace of hearts
I have to shine my shoes
I have to unpack my luggage
I hurt my foot
I like a pen with a fine point
I like canned fruits
I like chocolate ice cream
I like French cooking
I like this model
I like your frankness
I miss my mother very much
I must go
I need a box of nails
I prefer plain materials
I refuse to do it
I saw her at the station
I see no means of solving this
I think the same as you
I waited all afternoon in vain
I want a light spring coat
I want a small bunch of grapes
I want to be paid in cash
I want to buy an automobile
I was speechless with emotion
I went to the wrong door
I will do it gladly
I woke up at sunrise
Investigate the cause of it
It contracts with the cold
It has to be done
It left me indifferent
It must be pretty cold
It never snows in this country
It was a horrible scene
It was a solid gold bar
It was an informal meeting
It was an unfortunate accident
It was far from certain
It was the general opinion
It was very cold last night
It was very cold that winter
Keep a copy of that document
Keep in mind what I tell you
Knock before entering
Learn to keep time
Leave a blank space
Let them do it themselves
Listen a minute
Lock the door when you go out
Make a bundle of these clothes
Make any arrangements you like
May God reward you
Money is needed
Most children are playful
Movies are a great diversion
My cigar went out
My conscience bothers me
My hands are chapped
My wife was there
My wish is to please you
None of my friends know
Now I understand what you mean
One should not make comments
Open the door
They are ringing the bell
Our forces occupied the city
Pardon me for interrupting you
Payment is required in advance
Please call a taxi
Poke the fire
Pork has a lot of fat
Put a mark on this page
Put aside those fears
Put it on my account
Put it within reach
Put on your hat
Put the child to sleep
Put the money in your pocket
Put two blankets on the bed
Restrain your impulses
Roll up those magazines
Say it in plain terms
Send it in duplicate
Send the bill to my house
Send the letter airmail
Send them to me
Serve the fish on that platter
Show this gentleman the way
Sign it at the bottom
Sit at the end of the table
Skincare is important
Sleep on it before deciding
So far everything is all right
So long
Soak this sponge in water
Speak to the manager
Spitting is prohibited
Spread the sand evenly
Step aside
Stick to the subject
Stir the soup until it boils
Swallow it
Take the money with you
Take the subway right here
Take this chair
Tell me all the details
Tell the maid to make the beds
That boy is a bad influence
That boy is a chatterbox
That business was a gold mine
That coin is counterfeit
That displeased everyone
That effort bore no fruit
That girl is very attractive
That guy has a lot of nerve
That hat matches the suit
That intrigued everybody
That job bores me to death
That makes no difference to me
That man has a bad reputation
That man has a very good build
That man was a wretch
That man was born lucky
That man was pestering me
That noise distracts me
That picture will amuse you
That rule applied to everybody
That upset all our plans
That water pipe leaks
That woman blocked my way
That work is poorly done
The allotment is inadequate
The almond trees are in bloom
The automobile stopped
The axle is broken
The blade was very sharp
The bottle contained wine
The box was made of sandalwood
The boys have ruined the radio
The business failed
The business was a failure
The cabinet resigned
The car was going forward
The cart was in the shed
The ceremony was impressive
The cinders were still smoking
The city is on a plain
The cold is intense
The contract expires today
The corporal is on furlough
The council agreed on it
The decision was unavoidable
The dog ran away from us
The enemy attacked from behind
The enemy attacked furiously
The explosion shook the ground
The family lived in poverty
The firemen localized the fire
The fish was very fresh
The flood ruined the crops
The floor has to be scrubbed
The floor is very slippery
The future looked very gloomy
The ground floor was flooded
The ground was very uneven
The heat withered the flowers
The house caved in
The house is farther on
The house is on the hill
The letter was addressed to me
The lumber is still green
The maid served the tea
The medal had an inscription
The money was all there
Nobody touched it
The monkey is in the cage
The morning was clear
The negotiations fell through
The news shocked me
The news shocked the public
The night was cool
The noise was a nuisance
The noise was ceaseless
The pasture is full of weeds
The people pushed their way in
The police dispersed the crowd
The press confirmed the rumors
The problem had to be faced
The question deserved study
The rainfall was very heavy
The reports were confusing
The river overflowed
The room was a complete mess
The room was full of people
The shotgun went off
The show was well attended
The signature was forged
The soldiers fired
The stamp came off
The station was deserted
The street lights went on
The sun fades colors
The tines of the fork are bent
The trees were full of birds
The trees were in a row
The two rooms are connected
The verdict was unfavorable
The wall had a crack in it
The watch spring broke
The watch was guaranteed
The water began to boil
The water flooded the streets
The weather is very bad
The wheels got all muddy
The wound healed
Then we went to the theater
There was a detour on the road
There will be three
These shoes hurt me a little
These shoes hurt me
These shoes hurt
These socks are a bargain
They agreed on everything
They are very far away
They arrived at twilight
They ate up all the cake
This account is correct
This and no more
This annoys me very much
This box is made of tin
This chair is uncomfortable
This cloth is very thick
This copy is full of mistakes
This fish has a lot of bones
This hill overlooks the city
This is a duplicate copy
This is a mechanical toy
This is a mess
This is a spotted dog
This is a very hard mattress
This is an express train
This is for internal use
This is the ticket line
This merchandise is tax free
This new song is a big hit
This pencil is yours
Mine is on the desk
This scene delights me
This spoils all my plans
This well is very deep
Those colors clash
Those colors go well together
Those things happen often
Tom and Mary will go with me
Try not to move so much
Try to recall what happened
Turn on the gas
Turn on the ignition
Two divisions have surrendered
Typhus is a contagious disease
Unfasten the pin
Use this as a model
Very few people know it
We are going from bad to worse
We are taking two spare tires
We ate a very delicious pie
We do all kinds of repairs
We enjoyed the party very much
We finished the work
We got in after a long wait
We had a rough voyage
We had a slight accident
We have had a bad time
We have to make a decision
Wait
The sisters hate each other
My sister stole my clothes
She does not listen
He does not listen
You need to lose weight
Judge for yourself
I want to look like her
Now or never
I really want to know her name
We have to undo what was done
We have to wash the clothes
We made a good buy
We met at the door of my house
We met last week
We must balance our budget
We see each other every day
We took it for granted
We went along a narrow road
We went down a very rough road
We were walking on the deck
There were no survivors
Write the address clearly
Write your full name
You have to take in my jacket
You look very pretty today
Hi
Luck is blind
He is dishonored
I speak Berber to my teacher
Tom made Mary wash his car
Tom made Mary wash the car
Tom broke the rules
Tom changed the subject
Tom clicked his fingers

Look at this image
Look at that image
She is a professor
Tom is cleverer than me
That says it all
She tuned her guitar
Her car overtook ours
Your car overtook ours
Ken drove Tom to the hospital
This situation would suit Tom
It was a bad film
It looks like a UFO
It was a horrible idea
The party was my idea
I miss my old job
This place is sort of romantic
This place smells bad
The kids are in bed
Tom has been disqualified
The doors are locked
Keep our eyes peeled
The doors are opened
The treaty has been signed
The banks are closed
The doors are closed
The house was deserted
It needed to be said
Now look what you did
I hope you change your mind
Excuse me for a second
Come here for a second
Let me show you around
Lie down on the ground
I heard a sound
This sandwich is good
The fire feels good
We need some ice
Go back to your office
A policeman is outside
My mommy went outside
It should be possible
I want to wash up a little
Call me if you need me
It really bugged me
Nobody ever helped me
My arm is killing me
Come and dance with me
Switch places with me
Nobody listens to me
Maybe you can help me
Nobody ever helps me

Everybody else is gone

Go grab your briefcase
It was a nice surprise
Get back on your horse
It could be much worse
My niece is a nurse
I forgot my purse
Come back to the house
I checked the date
There is no antidote
Excuse me for a minute
Just relax a minute
Maybe I should leave
I really should leave
Take your shoes off
Take a few days off
I have dandruff
Forget the whole thing
I was daydreaming
The police are coming
The buses are leaving
This is where you belong
It appears I was wrong
I got married too young
Help me move the couch
Please let me finish
Tom will be right back
Go grab your backpack
This jacket fits pretty well
Everyone needs a dream
Maybe I fooled them
I already called Tom
Tom rushed into the room
Be as quick as you can
Keep your ears open
The baby is crying again
It was nice to see you again
I hate the rain
The party is still going on
Tom put his cap back on
Make your own decision
This looks like fun
It looked like a gun
Another day has begun
My house burned down
Let me write this down
Maybe I should go
Mind your step
Maybe we should stop
My boys are all grown up
Boston is where I grew up
It looks like a bar
Get back into your car
Get into your car
You should try a little harder
Go get me another beer
Make me a better offer
Let me think this over
My life is almost over
Get me another lawyer
Blue is my favorite color
I missed you kids
Enjoy yourselves
Maybe I deserve this
Let me deal with this
See you in three weeks
Put down your weapons
My life is such a mess
Come downtown with us
Maybe you can help us
This could be serious
It makes me curious
It makes me jealous
It looks like a cactus
Being married is great
I need a hat
There is no hope left
Maybe we should fight
Let someone else handle it
Ask Tom to explain it
Maybe I should do it
Maybe we can fix it
Maybe we should wait
Maybe I should quit
It was your own fault
It was partly my fault
Excuse me for a moment
Just relax a moment
It bothers me a lot
Maybe we should start
Baseball is my favorite sport
Please hear me out
Maybe I can help out
I may outlive you
Nobody can hear you
Let me do this for you
Maybe I can show you
Roll down the window
I have another job now
Tom is in college now
Tom is in charge now
Get me out of here now
Maybe we should go now
You should go now
I can do it now
Get off my property now
Have a wonderful day
The banks are closed today
I loved the play
Tom used a credit card to pay
Your shoes are muddy
You owe me money
Tom demanded an apology
The house appears to be empty
Come back to the party
These boxes are heavy
This tyre is punctured
They are continuing to call
They continue to call
These women are strong
She speaks English
The sea was glassy
He recovered quickly
I was big in Japan
Change will take time
This is the rule of the game
Let us not deceive ourselves
People want a solution
Mutual steps have to be taken
We too have a similar approach
Apathy is worse than antipathy
The answer may surprise you
The car turned to the left
The director is away on a trip
Autumn is almost here
Tom is a sheep farmer
She has a roll
Tom tried putting on the coat
It seems Tom is very sleepy
I am Aunt Wang
An army is a group of soldiers
Future needs past
I do not have a family
The car turned left
I have the book on hand
Those shoes are hers
She has a telephone
He has a telephone
I think she has two sons
I think he has two sons
I think she has two children
I think he has two children
An alternative is possible
A raindrop fell
Here are a million hugs
What a pity
That is right
Their parents were farmers
Tom tied his shoe laces
Tom tied his laces
Tom tied his shoelaces
Some men get the world
There are insects everywhere
Nothing could please me more
I have always had faith in you
I like rock
I am the one who knocks
It seems that it will rain
I want to have a friend
It sounds a bit goofy
Recently
I killed him
I killed her
I have psoriasis
Finnish is finished
I feel like drinking
No one likes the loser
We seem to be confused
We had beaten a football giant
I cannot help but regret it
This is a paper ticket
His dog ran around in the yard
This movie makes no sense
I have lost my briefcase
She has a cleft lip
He has a cleft lip
He tried not to cry
Thank you
I feel like a walk
This is a mass uprising
No one speaks his true mind
The woman is not young
Time to rise and shine
I will go to school
The kids catch butterflies
She wants him to be happy
I am a United States citizen
Everything is clear now
That clears up everything
I did it with my own two hands
The story moved me to tears
She wants to see you dead
I was forgotten
This is an hotel I know of
That one is also some hotel
She spoke French
They were speaking German
He has spoken Spanish
I have been speaking Spanish
I am at lunch
They are
I feel like a pizza
I will rent a car
Excuse me
My name is James
We are on the way home
My son left today
Someone will close the window
The boy is asking a question
The boys are asking questions
Liisa was in a bad mood
The device is portable
Honesty is the last castle
He lost all hope
No one lives in that house
He came over to my house
Courtesy costs nothing
Mexico
Nobody is here
I got soap in my eyes
Some survived
No verb in this sentence
I have bread
You have meat
We have fruit
You have water
They have sugar
It was for her own good
Give me fire
He brought me coffee
She brought me coffee
She was busy
This is my third week
Sweep the floor
He has gone fishing
Tom voted for Obama
Tom voted for Romney
Mary is gossiping with Kate
I never saw it coming
Peace is preferable to war
I know you must be terrified
You approached the well
I adopted an orphan
Tom made the situation worse
I feel like going out
She took his book
I am your friend
She is very teachable
I went for a swim
It was morning
This is rather strange
This is so unreal
I must go to Istanbul
I came only for you
I got dressed in a hurry
I was tired because of my work
Your lives could be in danger
The girls were emotional
He is not in the city
I like chicken
You can take a bus or a tram
I will understand
I wish I could do the same
You hit the bullseye
I only met him once
I smiled
Tom lured us into a trap
Come give mommy a kiss
John ran into the bedroom
I was stung by a bee
A smile crossed my face
Tom has put on more weight
They brought umbrellas
She arrived there before Tom
Today there is no lesson
The last mile is the longest
Your English is very good
The train has already left
We set out by car
You know what I think of that
You know how I feel about that
She is as guilty as Tom
Mary is as guilty as Tom
I checked my bags
You are as guilty as he is
I am not doing anything now
That movie is ace
Here is what I ate today
You said that it was important
They said it was important
He said it was important
She said it was important
He said that it was important
She said that it was important
You are not eating anything
The car needs a service
Ixtli has a lovely face
Tochtli likes rabbit meat
Xochipepe likes flowers
Meztli likes the moon
I prefer not to comment
He kept silent for a long time
Poland is not yet lost
I like hiking in the mountains
We cleaned up our room
The phone is on the table
You used to read novels
This egg smells bad
I asked him to keep me posted
The motor stopped
Tom likes to play with my dog
All girls love horses
She used to get up early
She deserves a better life
I can hardly believe this
These people are prejudiced
I love you with all I am
This is yet to come
The man is driving a car
The daisy is white
White bears live in the Arctic
I have never heard her say no
I have never heard him say no
I found out we were all alike
The wound bled
That is enormous
You have two younger siblings
Nothing can spoil the fun
Stop the childish cutesy act
You are aggressive
Every Jack has his Jill
Give me my portion
The price of food has gone up
My friends are my family
I met somebody online
Tom is just an average guy
Mary is just an average girl
Tom sat down beside her
Tom drives an electric car
My battery is almost dead
Many trees were cut down
I talk fast
I remember it well
I am forever busy
Give me water
The little boy was ecstatic
This man is very generous
It smells like gas
I want to introduce you to her
The pencils are sold in dozens
My native language is Turkish
I want to do some sport
This task was dead tedious
Do not misunderstand this
An old pond
A frog jumps in
The sound of water
You have time to think
I tried to stay calm
She entertains the children
Mary smoked a cigar
We waited ten minutes
The cherry is red
There is an old pond
I could hear the splash
Please free the captured birds
Good
Remain here in silence
This is the end
I like black
She declined my invitation
I bought him a clock
They also saw it
They also saw him
Tom is kind and generous
You look sleepy
It hail stoned
It was sunny
There is a storm
There was a storm
He threw a punch at the thug
I could not believe what I saw
I am having a good time
There are islands in the sea
We are changing the future
We have what we deserve
I wrote my songs myself
I have never been to Florida
The best is saved for last
We are just trying to help you
He only works during the day
There are islands in the ocean
Turn right at the red light
You should wait here
You have beautiful hands
Cold weather is really good
You look like my sister
This is our secret
Pain is inevitable
Suffering is optional
You love him more than me
You love her more than me
You love him more than I do
You love her more than I do
I want to eat something sweet
All wisdom comes from above
I made some good buys
Fun is everywhere
I got the wrong number
Always tend your fires
I saw him last weekend
I saw her last weekend
I just cleaned all the tables
My feet are smaller than yours
I hope you recover soon
I lent Tom the car

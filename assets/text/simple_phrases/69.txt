Move that car from there
Tom stuttered
Tom keeps bringing me down
Tom is abusing his position
Fast food is unhealthy
It was hot today

Tom called for attention
Yanni is the chosen one
Yeah
I remember this song
Tom reflexively apologizes
Tom abused several children
They are going to arrest Tom

Tom always smiles
Some are arrogant
Arrogant people are not humble
Arrogant people are often mean
Arrogant people are often rude
I want to improve my Berber
Tom will bring it to you
They will be eliminated
They are being eliminated
Privacy is important to us

Sawsan lost her memory
Put it on the top shelf
Tom is coming for us
I missed the first class
It rains already
I miss my brother so much
Mary is in the cathedral
We must go to the auto shop
The car is broken
We must go to the garage
I think you get the point
I already took off my sweater
The water was up to his waist
I sat on this
Please please tell it to me
We speak English
Her shoes were white
Dad asked me to open the door
Zamenhof was a very wise man
We waited for morning
Tom went shopping to Kaufland
Tom likes shopping in Kaufland
He nodded in agreement
He foolishly killed the goose
I have a house near Moscow
Relax
He uses the silence tactic
Tom assailed me
She cried in front of me
He started laughing harder
He ended the call
He was so happy to hear that
I called him in the morning
Have a nice sleep
She served the tea
You will get a discount on it
He replied with a smile
I think this is Esperanto
We feel bored
They feel bored
I wish you a happy new year
We got through it
Only Tom can help them
See you the day after tomorrow
He swum back to the shore
Let me hug you goodbye
No room is currently available
I asked him to stop the car
He handed over the money to me

Rest as much as you want
I want to win a lot
Everyone came except her
The bathroom is on the right

This kid fell from the bridge
You came so quickly
I regret having done it
It is cool outside
You must put on a shirt
We have to empty it
I was on a diet
She was educated by her aunt
The skirt is small on me
My sister is well
The medicine helped a little
Take the towel out of the bag
I get paid every month
They had ancient weapons
That tree is very pretty
Baby hedgehogs are adorable
Wages are falling
French was so hard to learn
We have to talk face to face
The oxen are plowing
I am only lying down
He speaks Kabyle fluently
You are a very naughty boy
Accept yourself
Develop yourself
Accept yourself fully
You should isolate yourself
You should close your eyes
Try to visualize it
Relax your body
Become aware of your thoughts
Become aware of your feelings
Just relax and close your eyes
Focus on my voice
Notice that
Sit there and listen to me
Put your attention on that
Have great sex
I just wanted to live like one
Give your work love
Stuff happens in life

You are running fast
I love swimming in the sea
I love swimming in the ocean

To hell with you
I am the new kid on the block
Find an uninhabited area
He saw us off to the station
Maybe you succeed
All hell starts to break loose
You accepted the challenge
Now face the consequences
The doctor was optimistic
I call that stupidity
I feel the same way about them
Stop hanging out with him
Stop going out with him
That was a joke
But not in this world
No

His hair is short
Fold the bed sheet
I bought a new hat at the mall
I want to kiss you

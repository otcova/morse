Our team came home in triumph
Keep the fire alive
We sat over a fire
Science rests upon observation
Sleep and wait for good luck
I live in Kakogawa
I cannot thank you too much
I am entirely at your service
Music moves the feelings
Salt preserves fish from decay
I adore going to the cinema
The driver increased his speed
It is cool after the rain
It is likely to rain
It looks like rain
Not a moment could be lost
It is you who is to blame
Mt
Aso is an active volcano
Lake Akan is frozen over
The eagle is king of birds
Our army attacked the kingdom
She bit into the apple
Lincoln is a great person
The lion is king of beasts
Hello
It is time to go to bed
I have had more than enough
It is time to go to school
I am looking for my glasses
They are all irritable
It will clear up soon
Fill out the form in ballpoint
He seated himself on the bench
My film has run out
The bellows are not working
The bus stopped sharply
The bus nearly ran over him
Nothing would persuade him
No one ever saw such a thing
Perhaps it will snow tomorrow
Smoking does you harm
You should not speak so loud
I cannot afford to pay so much
Sleep off the problem
There is no person to do it
It is not necessarily so
It will do him no harm
It has had no effect on him
It is a difficult problem
It is neither good nor bad
I cannot possibly do it
I have lost interest in it
It is all I want to do
The problem perplexed him
I have already read the book
The beautiful woman is kind
I saw the boy in brown shoes
The ship went down slowly
The ship is bound for Finland
Fish abound in this river
The baby wept to sleep
The baby cannot walk yet
He is to blame for it
The girl looked so pale
The incident upset him
The car consumes a lot of fuel
The failure depressed him
The child grabbed the candy
That child did nothing but cry
That child got bored
She put it in the box
The lake abounds with fish
The play was produced by him
Carry on with your plan
I will keep the fish alive
The fish tasted like salmon
The pole inclined to the left
The scissors are not sharp
There is no doubt about it
You had better not go there
I will do it by all means
The Smiths are our neighbors
I will write you back soon
You cannot miss it
It will be ready soon
I did you wrong
But Tony was not a clever boy
So you are back again
I am really into soccer
Down come the rain in torrents
I am sorry to trouble you
These flowers bloom in spring
These cakes are good
Please try one
This is the bible of baseball
This is her book
This is her pen
This is what I bought in Spain
This is his formula
This is how I learned English
This is the train for New York
It is hot in this room
I cannot accept this gift
This coat looks loose on me
This lady is Indian
The watch keeps accurate time
This poem is attributed to him
This ring is expensive
Show me some cheap ones
The child is learning quickly
This task is too much for him
Fish abound in this lake
This fish is free from poison
This machine is of great use
This hotel will not do
This salad tastes of lemon
The glass broke to pieces
It is nice and cool here
You cannot park your car here
I prefer coke to coffee
This is how I mastered English
This is why I fired him
Mr Grey did not enjoy his job
Kuala Lumpur is worth visiting
Greek is difficult to learn
I cannot eat anything today
I have been busy today
Cancer took him
Curry sauce is very nourishing
Father is having a bath
Father found me a good seat
Father ran to the bus stop
I am sorry for you
Ellie is very feminine
Every dog is a lion at home
Our baby cannot talk yet
Summer has gone all too soon
Jesus answered them
They are too close
Those children use bad words
That boy is a handful
She is always smiling
That child is always fretting
The child puts adults to shame
You had better go in person
You may use my typewriter
You are too kind to me
He said that you need not go
You must do as you are told
You must go to Harajuku
I cannot lend this book to you
You came out of the room
I will be back by nine
It is five minutes to nine
I missed school for six days
He stayed there for three days
Akagi from upstairs
He will be back in a few days
He was playing tennis all day
I will be back in an hour
The stepmother was hard on her
The moon shines at night
A dog ran about in the garden
Shadow him
The park is well wooded
I have an ulcer in my mouth
The factory did not want him
You had better do it right now
I have been reading this book
I have been lucky until now
It is fine today
It is pretty cold today
It is rather warm today
It is pretty warm today
Today is my sixteenth birthday
It is a little cool today
It is sunny today
It is cloudy today
It is windy today
You played tennis yesterday
A man called on you last night
Eat and drink up
You get off at Yotuya Station
Baby is sleeping
I am to blame
We call our dog Pochi
We are to eat at six
We danced to the disco music
We had a sound sleep
We queued up for the bus
We went by way of Taiwan
We have no spare money
I cannot afford the time
I cannot quite understand it
I have a previous appointment
My wife was a Smith
In my beginning is my end
My car is a Toyota
My birthday is in November
My birthday falls on Sunday
Father is angry with me
Mother is very busy just now
He is only a baby in my eyes
I have been learning a science
I made this kennel by myself
I like Azuchimomoyama Castle
I am on holiday this week
I cannot afford to keep a car
I am an American
I got an ink blot on this form
I am boarding with my uncle
She gave a faint smile
I have some work to clear up
I am able to swim here
I remember posting this letter
I am invited to this party
I am crazy about golf
I have been to the supermarket
I visited Canada long ago
I visited Kyoto long ago
I am not good at sports
I gained admission to the club
I am tired of the work
I have given up on that case
I bought the girl a sweater
I carried the message to him
I tackled him on the problem
I went to Kawagoe by taxi
I often call on him
I am beginning to remember it
I have done all that I can
I am poor at tennis
I cannot get rid of my cough
I lost my way in New York
I am a cat person
I am to go to Paris
I cannot read French
I have lost my pen
I will go there no more
I have already done it
I caught sight of Namie Amuro
I am fond of the cinema
I must brush up my English
I live in Yokohama
I am an office worker
I am poor at drawing
I have a picture of an airport
I cannot follow your logic
I would have been shot
I lead a happy life
I have been busy all this week
I have been busy lately
I am from Shikoku
I bought a watch with cash
I turned page after page
I am tired of homework
I have finished my assignment
I am very sensitive to heat
I have been to the library
I am poor at swimming
I am an optimist by nature
I dived into the river
I am not well at all
He can neither read nor write
I know that it was done by him
I came to like him
I am sure of his success
I play with him
I asked after him
I pledged my loyalty to him
I believe in what they said
I gave way to their demands
I suppose they are coming
I dropped them off at Kanda
I think highly of him
I came to know him
I made an ass of him
I relied on him
I found her mending a skirt
I was very worried about her
I went to Kyushu by airplane
I have been down with a cold
I pricked up my ears
I live in Hyogo
I am on the side of democracy
I have been to the post office
I stick to the point
I missed the train
I should have come earlier
I am also a citizen of Tokyo
I also stopped sleeping
I myself did it
I myself saw it
Our ship docked at Marseilles
We got this chair free
The clock has just struck ten
I am fixing the clock
My ear is ringing
The car just shaved the corner
I cannot describe my feelings
The boat is lost
The shop did not want him
A little pot is soon hot
The prize went to him
Ueno is the station after next
A novelty wears off in time
People laughed at him
Clear water breeds no fish
There is nothing like sleep
I am good at math
It is clearing up
I do not know exactly
Raw fish easily goes bad
Old habits die hard
A red dress made her stand out
The baby lies sleeping
It has been snowing on and off
He won the prize this week
The other day I saw the girl
I bought a watch the other day
It keeps good time
Mt
Asama is now dormant
Mt
Asama is not as high as Mt
Fuji
That is not altogether bad
Grandmother looked very well
I hope you will answer soon
You had best go home early
He who laughs last laughs best
Many trees are bare in winter
The sun was shining bright
Avoid those men who are idle
I am bored to death
No one knows the fact
Nobody can surpass him
No one respected men like him
The ground is still wet
You had better have breakfast
Birds fly south in winter
I passed a boy in the street
Sadako gave a weak nod
The enemy answered our fire
The electric light went out
Switch off the light
Send the telegram at once
You need not have called me
It seldom snows here in winter
Wear warm clothes in winter
It is wrong to steal
No wonder you are so happy
I know how Piggy feels
Nara is a very old city
They both are wearing a hat
Mt
Welcome to Japan
The Japanese have dark eyes
The fever has risen
Age diminished his strength
The waves are rising
A horse is a friendly animal
The fine shall be paid in cash
The revolt was crushed
Tell me when he will come
Tell me what has become of him
Tell me how he got it
It is clear that he is rich
The door shut after him
I get on well with him
He has no friend to play with
Be on your guard against him
He was awarded a special prize
He is qualified as a solicitor
He has a family to support
There is a scandal about him
You may catch him
I mailed a parcel to him
I felt sympathy for him
I have business with him
Do not take any notice of him
His opinion is quite just
His words offended me
I spoke after him
Pain shot through his finger
I was offended at his behavior
He is Italian by birth
His land abuts on the road
I felt drawn toward him
She took him by the arm
He makes good use of his time
He comes to Tokyo once a year
He went out a few minutes ago
He went to Paris two years ago
He comes here every three days
He lives alone in an apartment
He will be a good teacher
He seems to be a nice fellow
He has been to England twice
He crossed over to England
He is an Italian
He is always late for school
He was excluded from the club
He knows this town inside out
He whipped around the corner
He bought a suit for cash
He was reluctant to go there
He is afraid of the dog
He was frightened at the sight
He was all alone in the house
He scraped mud from the door
Words failed him
He would not admit his fault
He went to some place or other
He is very angry
He is studying law at Harvard
He made a journey to Paris
He has gone abroad by himself
He has been to France
He has not been to France
He decided to go to France
He ran water into the bathtub
He lay on his back on the bed
He is afraid of snakes
He comes here almost every day
He is an earnest young man
He came near to being run over
He has a good memory
He is a man of his word
He used to bully his friends
He likes to travel by himself
He likes to travel alone
He is notorious as a liar
He taught me how to swim
He is keen on science
He likes swimming in summer
He has a family to provide for
He is not of our number
He was moved to tears
He was red with anger
He was unaware of the danger
He never shrinks from danger
He is hard to please
He hurried back from England
He lives in an enormous house
He was paralyzed with terror
He went fishing in between
He is now staying in Paris
He has built two houses so far
He uses honey instead of sugar
He came back three days later
He fells trees on the mountain
He breeds cattle for market
He laughed in spite of himself
He works under me
He is a better swimmer than I
He was sick of his job
He clings to his customs
He made a lot of easy money
He shook his head up and down
He writes me once a week
He is a proficient pianist

He was angry with his son
He is above deceiving others
He is inclined to be lazy

He is a work horse
He is in the prime of life
He is a Japanese boy
He is raising tropical fishes
He is too old
He is employed on the farm
He made advances to her
He is not kind to her
He got away with her watch
He took her by the upper arms
He is a very decent fellow
He is as poor as can be
He was sitting on the quay
He was subjected to insult
He is standing on the stage
He is suffering from a cold
He is a real fool
He is no good as a lawyer
He went out without a hat
He cares little for my advice
He will be really pleased
He got a cold from his sister
He was all smiles
He was absorbed in a manga
His eyes were heavy with sleep
He will be sleeping
He was eager for recognition
He is flying to Paris tomorrow
He is a cheerful young man
He collided with a tree
He is crazy about baseball
He is full of ambition
He is as good as his word
He is a famous merchant
He is depressed
He bought his way into college
A baby was born to them
Their hobby is fishing
Their efforts came to nothing
They named the dog Shiro
They breed cattle and horses
They labored in the factories
They named their dog Lucky
They each sang in turn
They became food for fishes
I think that they will be late
They seem to go together

She is my elder sister
She shows no zeal for her work
She is brave for a girl

Kitadake
I am certain of your success
I got nervous on stage
It took me an hour by train
It is not a real mansion
May all my dreams come true
I quite forget your name
I bet it will rain tomorrow
I am afraid of having trouble

The train got into London

You know what it is

I like to read
Stop talking about my family
Whatever you say buddy
Everybody ran outside
He ran outside naked
They were both naked
Both were naked
He has a butler and a cook
We can talk this through
I often study with music
She was a real gem of a person
Things like that happen
I sit down for so long
Your room is big
I need an apple
Strictly forbidden
He never said that
He plays golf every weekend
This is his plane
He confused us
I like to eat lamb kebabs
She has a big butt
To gain time we took the plane
Evil spirits are mean
Bye for now
I only have clothes
I only have personal items
I only have this briefcase
I only have this baggage
I only have two pieces
It was the Pan Am flight
It was the Varig flight
It is the Varig flight
It is the flight from Recife
It is the flight to Recife
Someone is waiting for me
Someone is looking at me
You are confusing me
She is teaching me
Yara is avoiding me
It was my suitcase
It was a good example
Today I have to study
I have to stay
I had to tell the truth
They all wanted a taxi
We had too much clothing
I opened all my suitcases
You have to meet my children
I had to open my suitcase
They stick together like glue
Things happen
The television is broken
I think he is sick
I bought a watch in that shop
I hope he can help you
Mary has to go to school
I saw her sweep the room
I saw her wash the car
I apologise for arriving late
That is an epic novel
The cat has twenty years
Tom will have to do the work
I can live with that
Tom has enough time
They invited them to dinner
I have some very good news
You have lots of time
You are in serious trouble
We have been here for two days
I have been here for one week
I have worked here for a week
I have been here for two years
I left New York two weeks ago
I arrived two weeks ago
I ate lunch two hours ago
I got up an hour ago
I studied there a year ago
I lived there three years ago
I bought it a month ago
John arrived a week ago
He owes me a favor
He owes me one
She owes me a favor
They need new shoes
Mary needs new shoes
It was a waste of time
It was consensual
This is not my problem
We challenge you
We resist you
We oppose you
We confront you
We face you
Pardon my French
This is bullshit
John has five apples
John has five apples
He gives one to Mary
Please put your shirt on
She sounded mad
Kim arrived back home safely
He will soon be back
He is arriving shortly
Actinium is a silvery metal
It hurts to see Mary suffer so
I like learning old languages
I ask myself what he did
Mary was proud of her beauty
I hope that you are not angry
Eric is an eternal optimist
Alice was unfaithful to Eric
The cock crows
He behaved as it should be
We could give it a try
Mary has dinner at seven
Anyway
He asked me if I were happy
I continued reading the book
My aunt gave me flowers
Criminals should go to jail
You look so cool
Lava lamps are awesome
Something was wrong
She never told me
It keeps me up at night
People are looking at us
It tastes like chicken
Give it a shot
The moon has come out
The moon is out
The forecast calls for rain
This is a low end restaurant
I know I can trust you
He came amiss
Black cats bring bad luck
Quickly buy all required items
The failure shamed Liisa
I had another dream
He gave me a call
She is gaining weight
It rained for three days
She gained weight
They should be put in jail
They came with kith and kin
They came with bag and baggage
The came with kit and caboodle
I was young at the time
Trust me on that
He got kicked off the team
He turned a blind eye
I gave you my word
He gave me his word
Stay in the car
I need a volunteer
We need a volunteer
No one wanted to volunteer
Forget about that
My shirt was ruined
She invited me over for coffee
Mules are sterile
Total tosh
My hands are cold
My parents are not home
Hang in there
There is a boy
I always lock my room
Someone locked me in the room
I often visit my relatives
The poor man has no relatives
I need to relax
I play football
Bring those men here
I read the Times
He lives with his mother
I am in this restaurant
I want more money
Maths is a good subject
Everybody likes money
You must obey your parents
She never saw her
She never saw it
She never saw him
I want to be an astronaut
Smog was very heavy today
Emili is pretty
He wants to squish the spider
He loves to eat
I am a Toki Ponan
He is a good musician
Meow
Our house is messed up
I want to talk about girls
I deserve better than this
His abs were flat and toned
Tom cleaned his glasses
He left the house
Women have beautiful cheeks
I will miss this place
We are working hard
Check your email
The password is too short
Give me a hammer
We made something wrong
If you want we can use English
Thanks for the visit
I like your website
The river is long
Mary is thirsty
My aunt died of leukemia
The silver is on the table
I own a miniature schnauzer
We should hang out
We should hang out sometime
We should hang out more
He owns an iguana
I hate fluorescent lights
I hate fluorescent lighting
That explains a lot
She kissed my cheek
She did it slowly
I got one for Christmas
I thought I was cool
I have no problem with this
Al Capone used the Tommy gun
He paid the money back
Fuck my life
He was stunned by her beauty
I knew it would happen
I miss him a lot
I miss her a lot
I think about him a lot
I think about her a lot
This rice is sticky
Thanks for all the fish
Humans originated in Africa
He said it with a broad grin
I should visit Kyoto
This is an open source project
He ogled a girl outside a pub
One of your boobs fell down
I never thought anything of it
Thou art very beautiful
That book is old
She had her navel pierced
We know each other quite well
He sat beside her on her bed
Your daughter is very pretty
She stretched out her legs
Watch out for zombies
We were attacked by zombies
He laughed nervously
She wriggled her toes
There are exceptions
She was on the verge of tears
French is the language of love
The first time is free
I want a flat stomach
She took a sip of her drink
It was hard to believe
I could not refuse
I had the time of my life
I grew up in a poor family
Things are about to get ugly
I need to do this
You need to do this
Everyone needs to do this
She barely ate her lunch
I was shaken
She was shaken by the accident
I swim here every morning
Welcome to the club
Dad went out to get postcards
This is a private matter
Tell me where she is
Tell me where he is
It was obviously a joke
Being poor is expensive
Thank you for stopping by
This is not funny anymore
I love to see you laugh
I love to see you smile
This is my final offer
They just left
He just left
Nice wheels
I got her phone number
I just want to be normal
Women love that
Keep driving
She will be here tonight
He is slowly catching up
We had to think on our feet
He will be here today
We walked to my room
I was no match for him
I was no match for her
We were always together
She looks good for her age
He looks good for his age
I hate shopping
She loves shopping
He hates shopping
I tried everything
I love my family
Keep an eye on her
I hate spinach
I ate some spinach
I forgot where the car was
I forgot what they called him
He set a precedent
He fell to the floor
Be careful
Be on your guard
I require an apple
His right eye is blind
You must unmask the imposter
Rules are made to be broken
You can sleep on the couch
He was like a father to me
I have to work tomorrow
We will talk about this later
I only have six months to live
We were just holding hands
This is a miracle
Make him work for it
Go away
I think we should talk
I love a woman
We were both drunk
They were both drunk
I came at about six
Learning Finnish takes time
Questions never hurt anyone
He felt pity for us
Help us
Listen closely
Quit complaining
Slow down
Tom screamed
Tom understood
She looks just like my sister
You look just like my sister
I really like that guy
I really like that girl
He slapped my ass
He can help you out
She can help you out
I can help you out
This makes my blood boil
That was totally my fault
He was tortured and murdered
She seems to be a good cook
I am not a paper cup
I was completely innocent
He is above criticism
It was an upset
I am totally confused
I am all mixed up
I hesitate a little
Today is my day
It became useless
Change target
He will be missed
They say it is just puppy love
This field is uncultivated
This field is fallow
Tom is unkempt
Tom is untidy
This field is wild
This field is untamed
Tom is disgusting
This thing terrifies me
They are unreliable
That dog looks very wasted
I am so stoned
There is no reason
Check please
Dig in
Enjoy your meal
I already ordered
We are not ready to order yet
It is delicious
At the bar
Another beer please
Two beers please
Please speak louder
It is too noisy here
Please stop that right now
He is very famous
This place is very dirty
He is twice as old as me
No one was hurt
I used to be like you
Try not to worry
I slept with my clothes on
He has a hairy chest
No criminal charges were filed
No one can replace you
Yesterday it snowed
They camped on the beach
We drank all night
I slept the rest of the day
You were great
He was great
She was great
I moved back with my parents
He moved back with his parents
This is a thoughtful vote
They grew closer
We grew closer every day
No man would say that
No women would buy that
He left early
She left early
Nobody deserves that
Tom never lived in Boston
I know the drill
Do not trust strangers
This makes me so mad
I asked what Tom is reading
You are my angel
I last saw him in the car park
I got where I am by hard work
Leaves go brown in autumn
She was all over me
He was all over me
I thought so at first
I think about him all the time
I think about her all the time
He told everybody at school
She told everybody at work
Keep an open mind
You should listen to her
You should listen to him
It will be over in a moment
I was totally shocked
He kissed me passionately
She kissed me passionately
This makes me so sad
That was not the only problem
She should be in charge
He should be in charge
You should be in charge
I should be in charge
Let me take a quick shower
You should be ashamed
You need to wake up
I am not hungry
The food was better in prison
Give me a call sometime
He was making out with Mary
We grew up together
Her face was white
He banged his head
He banged his knee
He denied everything
She denied everything
She loves to party
He loves to party
I love to party
It could have been worse
He burned the croutons
He wears designer glasses
I wish I had your job
She caught me watching porn
My mom walked into my room
I have seen enough
My cat is happy
Monkey bars are dangerous
Many lives were lost
Boats can sink
I just want your love
It sounds simple
War is hell
I have a date
The way of life
Change comes
Bad comes
All is good
Time comes
Advice comes
Children are innocent
One man one word
One woman one dictionary
Love the earth
Take care of our planet
Energy comes from inside
Youth is all in the heart
I love eating melons
I forgot the book at home
I like roast chicken
Work is in progress
I cooked chick pea soup
He is a glutton
She is a glutton
She is a big eater
I like eating melons from Hami
I like eating Hami melons
I like eating Kumul melons
You are a liar
Copying is not theft
Never change a winning team
My parents caught me smoking
He was checking you out
Your boyfriend looks cute
He forced me to go there
It stings
He has bought a banana case
I have no idea where we are
He bought a banana case
I hope we chat soon
He wants to eat this fruit
Nothing is free
He has gone into debt
I got an unpleasant news
See you later
The issue is getting solved
Tom was waiting for you
The place was totally deserted
That feels amazing
I was nervous as hell
She gave me hell
He wrapped his arms around me
He wrapped his arms around her
He was hurt and angry
We became best friends
I saw fear in his eyes
I saw fear in her eyes
I ran downstairs
He is such a show off
He showed me the ropes
You heard your mother
Please tell me what happened
This is a disaster
He thinks he knows best
She thinks she knows best
He just cares about himself
He only cares about himself
He only thinks about himself
My eyes are red
I chose to study stenography
We went to gather strawberries
The price of coffee went down
There is no road to love
Love is the road
I love her sister very much
You need a reality check
I got lucky
I need my privacy
The door was wide open
He just texted me
He just texted me
She just texted me
There are no customers
He grabbed my breasts
Everybody hates me
He drives a Ferrari
Her mouth fell open
He made no reply
She made no reply
It really breaks my heart
I got hammered last night
I can be there in ten minutes
You reek of alcohol
She passed out on the floor
She got me drunk last night
You need to sober up
Give me your keys
Give me your car keys
Give me the keys to your car
They look cool
My parents were proud of me
She sucks up to the teacher
Stop sucking up to the teacher
I let Tom drive my car
I let Tom in the house
I was sad
Our time is limited
I was listening
I was travelling
I was lying
I was contributing
I was learning
I was teaching
Man is a slave to habits
I was hunting
I was jumping
I was laughing
I was singing
I was pregnant
I was fool
I was married
I was breathing
She has three children
I want to become her friend
I need a little help
Erkin likes her too
My dear mother

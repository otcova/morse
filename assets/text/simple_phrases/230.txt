Maybe Tom has some candy left
This pencil belongs to me
You had better get going
I hope this works
But some with finding one
Go back to sleep
I was scared half to death
I was very scared
Tom found me a French teacher
Tom gave me a job
Tom gave Mary his kidney
Tom gave me a pamphlet
Tom gave me his key
Tom gave me that idea
Tom gave me thirty dollars
Tom gave me your number
Tom gave me your address
Tom gave Mary his heart
Tom gave that to me
Tom gave me that book
Tom gave me no choice
Come sit by me
Come and sit down
Tom opened the cage
Tom sang his daughter to sleep
He has read the book outside
This animal is dangerous
Write the question
I would adore living in Paris
I wish I could live in Boston
Everyone looked at Tom again
Come anytime you like
This is all I can do for now
His eyes were dark
He pulled at her heartstrings
Her eyes were wet
I need to talk to him alone
Tom is pretty persuasive
Tom is slightly suspicious
Tom is way older than he looks
I can come back tomorrow
He wanted change
Sharks are friends
My tears are cold
That one is not good
We made a snowman this winter
Last winter was very cold
You misunderstood me
We are looking for engineers
The tree is high
Tom has a great smile
Tom seems like a great guy
Remember that I love you
My parrot is so sweet
But nobody can help me
He keeps a parrot as a pet
Tom said I was popular
Put your coat on
Thanks for your contribution
He was jealous
Mary was jealous
We were jealous
They were jealous
You are not jealous
Tom is not jealous
They fell down the stairs
He came hoping to see you
He came hoping to meet you
Tom looked right and then left
Tom lowered his binoculars
Everyone looks scared but Tom
Everyone looked over at Tom
Tom handed Mary the scissors
Tom handed Mary the brochures
Tom handed Mary the broom
Everyone is looking at Tom
Everyone is staring at Tom
Tom is doing the laundry
Tom is doing the wash
The remedy is in the poison
Give me your knife
Her long speech bored us all
Look at these photos
I invited Tom over to my place
Look at your map
Thanks for calling me
Thanks for helping me
There are too many rules
I designed it myself
All dogs are animals
Promise not to tell anyone
He is proud of his collection
I believe that Tom loves me
Laurie swims well
Nobody said this would be easy
Someone tried to break in
Nobody needs to talk
Nobody needs to say anything
Nobody needs to get hurt
Nobody wants to be hated
Everyone wants to be loved
It was really touching
Come out with your hands up
I feel like seeing you
No one will trust her story
I live in northern Sweden
Lanzarote is a Spanish island
I went to Lanzarote last year
Lanzarote is very beautiful
Lanzarote is not so beautiful
I live in Tampa at the moment
I want to live in Tampa
I want to go to Tampa
Playing with fire is dangerous
Nobody saw anything
Maybe nobody wants to leave
Nobody looks very convinced

Somebody will see us
Somebody could get hurt
Someone has to tell Tom
Tom is looking for someone
Tom is talking to someone
Tom is waiting for someone
Someone will be here soon
Someone saw it happen
Someone could be hurt
Someone might see us
Remember not to tell anyone
Anyone can see that
It could have been anyone
Anyone could have made it
Everyone here is named Tom
Everyone is talking about Tom
Everybody laughed but Tom
Everybody laughed except Tom
They speak quickly
We speak quickly
I think I may vomit
I thought you were into it
Nobody paid any attention
Someone has to pay the price
Someone has to pay for this
Somebody has to take the blame
Nobody wants to be around Tom
You do ask a lot of questions
I want to marry a virgin girl
I will quit that party
Nobody can stop us now
Someone tried to kill us
This argument is pure rhetoric
Nobody really believed it
Nobody else would help us
Nobody else knew about it
Nobody else got hurt
Let somebody else do this
Let somebody else do it
Somebody else might get hurt
Give someone else a chance
Maybe someone else can help us
Go and apologize to Tom
Mary is on maternity leave
He is hopelessly romantic
You should grow facial hair
You can believe me
This is racism
Let me look
She does what she wants
You got here on time
I liked that book
I loved that book
It makes you look younger
It makes you look older
I am growing breasts
It is a lack of respect
Bring me a sandwich
I hardly know her
I hardly know him
I knew she was different
I knew he was different
Tom has already eaten supper
Tom bought a new house
The book is cheap
The book is expensive
The book is too cheap
Come and see us
Your house is very modern
She drinks like a fish
Mary drinks like a fish
We like him
The back of my neck hurts
I liked it a lot
You are a fantastic person
My world is fine
We pulled the teeth out
We pulled out the teeth
You said that it would happen
She ironed her hair
I did not have sex with him
She was lonely
He was lonely
He gazed into her eyes
Tom has the hots for Mary
I asked you a question
I broke my fingernail
Tom has a baby face
Looks are important
She really likes gossiping
I have nice hair
Kittens are curious
Lack of openness is a problem
I know he likes me
My heart was beating so fast
I was so shocked
He seems like a very nice man
Tom seems like a very nice guy
Mary is kind of cute
It looks like Tom was right
It looks like Tom was wrong
Tom held up his right hand
Tom has done this before

Sucks to be you

It was a humbling experience
Sit over there and shut up

You never understand anything
I am in Russia
Her flat is always clean

Without water one cannot live
The roses are red
I am studying Korean
Just tell them no
This has been a long week
Be careful
You heard what I said
We went to the beach together
She smoothed her hair
He is pretty cute
I hate liars

Nothing like that could happen
I have everything I need
Frankenstein is a work of art
You guys were just incredible
I was still at home
Tom is still at home
It goes like this
We like playing in mud
I want to buy the medicine
I am rich
Thou speakest
Ye speak
I sure could use some sleep
Keep the engine running
I am my own worst critic
I am my own biggest critic
I am Iranian
Caves are dark
That ought to do it
I knew you were behind this
Let me try again
They are so irrelevant
My opinion is irrelevant
My opinion was irrelevant
These details are irrelevant
Your opinion is irrelevant
This is completely irrelevant
I need to improve my French
She prefers French to German
I can not sleep well
Tom is eating
My humility makes me proud
Her dress was cheap
Her dress was a cheap one
That dude was a jerk
Stop yelling
My head hurts
Go and play with your friends
She batted her eyelashes
Try to catch me
You really are a piece of work
I was starting to lose hope
He was starting to lose hope
She was starting to lose hope
We were starting to lose hope
Tom was starting to lose hope
It looks like Tom has given up
My choices are my own
He really is over seventy
I think I have a fever
I was expecting the worst
Come in
Let me check your pulse
I coughed a lot
Your suit is the same as mine
They both blushed
Both Tom and Mary blushed
I want to go camping
You need to be proactive
We need to be proactive
Tom wrote Mary right back
Tom wrote right back to Mary
Comments are not needed
I want to know the facts
The bus driver opened the door
She was already pregnant
That is understood
That is easy

I grabbed the cat by the neck
I have eaten enough
Let me go first
It was a close thing once
It was a close thing
Let me show you

This is a family tradition
I like playing the gooseberry
You talk fast
You speak quickly
She speaks quickly
He is smarter than anyone
This is completely worthless
My advice was not followed
Money is power

Both are classic

There will be a cake
This was the perfect occasion

You get what you deserve
Gerunds are very funny
I can take it
I need those documents
Thank you
His sympathy is just for show
Solidarity is a weapon
She arrived too early
She is as flat as a pancake
I give the money to my son
Sentences can teach us a lot
Much more than just words
It reminds me of something
Her husband is rich
His husband is rich
Love is love
Please make some tea
My day is perfect already
I lost my points
That does not make sense

I watched a flick
One such language is Esperanto
That is the fastest car

A pond is a little lake
We should come in

He will come later

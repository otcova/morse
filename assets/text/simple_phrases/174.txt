Her husband is about to die
That woman scares me
I have eaten a whole cow
I am an artist
This one is all yours
That one is all yours
I owe you one
Call me
We all had to do it
I knew this moment would come
I sent you a letter
I bought a book of folktales
I will fight to the death
We wasted a lot of time
All apples are red
I heard someone shouting
I write in my diary every day
They all laughed at his error
This store sells vegetables
I prefer to go by bicycle
I prefer biking
My younger brother watches TV
I no longer have a home
The lake is full of fish
That was never there before
Nobody loves war
I woke up with a sore throat
Give me your thoughts
Whatever
Time is getting short
My life is complete
Harden up
I steal it from you
The last letter is mine
My parents are very strict
There is also Paolo
Me too
You are safe here with me
I have never met you in person
Sorry about earlier
We have no other choice
The ice watered down the juice
There seems to be a mistake
My head is exploding
The nuns are singing
I had a nosebleed today
Put more salt in the soup
My daughter likes Ultraman
My sister likes Ultraman
I was in Kyoto twice
The parrot is dead
This parrot is no more
The way is long
Time to go
You can have mine
I might be able to help
I found out where he is
I found out where she is
I saw some birds take off
There is another way
We found an anomaly
All you want is power
I walk to work every day
Milk is a common beverage
Believe in yourself
Be nice to others
Your wish has come true
The view is amazing
I will tell you when you visit
I think I remember you
I will try next week
My schedule is pretty crazy
Here are the rules
And now I want to watch it
His dream has realized
I brought mine
Most women think like that
Your words make me feel bad
We went to swim in the sea
My cousins live near the beach
The ocean is dirty
The boy has no food
I have something to tell you
I am your brother
Shut up
The last card is mine
I hate this girl
A drunk robbed me
My son is only a teenager
I want to say goodbye
You all have two books
We have ten head of livestock
Enter or exit
He kept quiet
I thus conclude that he agrees
The Holocaust was a hate crime
Genocides are hate crimes
He put a light on the roof
Latin is not hard
Books fascinate me
Cars are expensive
True friendship is invaluable
I share his political position
I do it without any problems
I share her political position
She is very healthy
That car is really expensive
There is a demon inside of me
That is mine
That is mine
That is mine
This bicycle is mine
Yours is over there
God is the cause of everything
My friend died from an injury
I can stay in the guest room
She never wears pants
All in good time
You are our only hope
Time was hard on her
My sister is kind to children
We had a good conversation
Try to encourage me a little
That was an unforgivable error
Leave me here
I was waiting for a long time
I ate with my baby brother
We play baseball
I would like to ask
Sun makes all the difference
I miss Paris so much
My eyes keep burning
My wife beats me
I knew where to search
I knew where to seek
I need a little time
We had an agreement
You broke it
I like to feed the pigeons
Never had I seen such a mess
She gave me a wonderful smile
They elected her president
We kissed each other
Give me back the TV remote
Nothing
The medicine only works on men
Men know nothing about women
Come and tell me in my room
We have a very serious problem
I never thought that about you
Do what you want
Suspenders make my personality
Fat people are hard to kidnap
I immediately gasped
A constellation shines
A set of benefits is in effect
A river flows
The river once flowed
The constellation once shone
The orchestra is playing
So I stopped reading
This shirt needs to be ironed
They paid separately
Fast food can be addictive
You owe me one real
I like challenges
There are no drugs here
I know nothing about women
I want a vanilla ice cream
I like strawberry ice cream
Look around you
You do the kitchen
Welcome to my life
I like bright colors
He is working in AIDS research
Me neither
I see the boy
The ship will stop in Yokohama
He broke his promise
Get a life
May Balrogs eat you
Your hair is pretty
What goes up must come down
May you have a lovely day
It is only you who want it
Only love can break your heart
He pretends to be deaf
I have a great life
I read a lot of modern authors
He entered through the window
The girl is drinking tea
He speaks a little English
It is there
Many greetings
I am happy to see you again
I eat with my hands
Any comments are welcome
Our flat has five rooms
This is my old bike
Men must live and create
Live to the point of tears
I study psychology
Now apologize
Gold is the king of kings
I will not eat ice cream
Kill them all
God will recognize his own
This CD costs ten dollars
Tofu goes well with sake
He is the law
Forget the last line
Training flies sounds very fun
He had a headache
Tofu goes well with good sake
The coffee is bitter
My home is your home
Junko is a beautiful girl
Any night the sun can come out
We are learning Arabic
Nobody lives forever
Carry me
The thief ran quickly
Look on their wall
This is getting hard
I wish I had this problem
You can always change it
I went way too blonde
All quiet on the Western Front
Your death is my life
She thinks about her next trip
He thinks about his next trip
He thinks about her next trip
She thinks about his next trip
Today is a day full of joy
Mom is always right
You must continue to study
You have to continue to study
My legs are weak
They blocked it
They blocked her
Learn Italian
You know I want to know it
The second lesson is very easy
I hate Sundays
It looks consequently bigger
I just woke up
I was showering a moment ago
I am very sad
His request is very reasonable
I ran into Ken at the park
Roulette is a game of chance
The meeting will end tomorrow
This knife is not sharp enough
Tom takes the bus to the city
Tom is on the bus to the city
The scores are standardized
She hardly speaks English
Almost no one believes her
One must follow the rules
The law punishes
I feel dead
See you at school
To err is human
He was immersed in the puzzle
There is no solution
We do not forget
A dolphin is a mammal species
Anger is a type of madness
If anyone can do it Bill can
I am better than you
Water and oil are fluids
Eat everything you wish
I eat fruit and drink water
Help him with French
The dog is still alive
I never dream
I need help with these boxes
My son loves rockets
Sometimes I need my father
Few people have a typewriter
Typewriters are so noisy
Put the disk in the computer
My grandmother cannot see
Bob came home pretty late
I still remember his name
I have a smelly girlfriend
She opened her eyes
We should have gotten married
This may be your last chance
This is the book I want to buy
Our kids are all tucked in
Now we can kick back and relax
Let me know what you find out
Let me go and buy some bread
I was thinking about you
I was really very happy
I was happy to help you
I thought you would say that
I think you should swim
I suggest we take the stairs
I really wanted to go
I promised not to tell him
I never liked that one anyway
I need your cooperation
I need to go to work
I need to go home
I need to go eat something
I need to finish my homework
I have some good news to share
I have a lot of questions
I gave up my job
I feel much better now

Good day

Only a little
I observe you
You observe me

They have authority in Europe
I prefer to say
I worked a lot this week
Add a dozen eggs to the list

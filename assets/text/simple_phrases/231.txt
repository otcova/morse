He wants to work in a factory
Death must be so beautiful
My birthday is coming up
Tom thinks Mary is beautiful
We need to take that bus
I saw the cook
This time it has to work
Smoking in bed is dangerous
Tom was in a bicycle accident
Tom gave me investment advice
Tom was clearly disappointed
All the world speaks English
I like this tea
Tom has quit smoking
Tom was her youngest brother
An apple is a tasty fruit
I had a terrible education
Maybe the poets are right
Maybe love is the only answer
It involves Russia
Love is the answer
I am older than you
She really does like animals
No one is saying that
I can share
Nothing would please me more
Tom climbed over the wall
Tom did most of the driving
This is not the right place
You have to know what you want
My baby can walk
Your baby can walk
His baby can walk
Her baby can walk
Our baby can walk
Their baby can walk
The war is over
I want to go back there
They won the match again
Tom had fun
Death is inevitable
We can play with language
I want to talk to your uncle
Someone ate all my cupcakes
I did something right
Dad always encourages him
I told you to shut up
Look at the guys around you
This man is not my husband
This guy has tried to kill me
Tom thought you were unhappy
Keep your fingers crossed
Tell them to stop the truck
Tom made a suggestion
Bring him a drink
Bring me my Marika
I want to see her
Come back here
Come back here
He tried to hit me last night
He was trying to kill me
I came back for one more job
This song is for you
Butterflies are beautiful
I thought he would be upset
Better never than late
I thought Tom would be upset
I thought Tom might be upset
I thought Tom might get angry
You gave me quite a start
Try to keep up your spirits
Tom sprang at me in a rage
Tom spoiled all my plans
Tom just did that for spite
Tom is a pretty stable person
Tom had a coughing spell
Tom drew a large square
This is my star pupil
They hired Tom on the spot
The scenery is really splendid
The front door stood wide open
The fire spread rapidly
The bugle sounded retreat
The airplane went into a spin
That was a very good speech
That really put me on the spot
Spin the wheel around
Put your books on the stand
Put some grease on the wheel
It squeaks
My new shoes squeak
Mary stood me up after all
Mary stomped her foot angrily
It sounds impossible
I wish I knew where I stood
I want to spend the night here
I love to wear sport clothes
I have to get this spade fixed
I have a special reason
I had a sound sleep last night
I can spare you some money
Go ahead and speak your piece
Tom gave Mary sound advice
We will need this to survive
He is my youngest brother
We can rest
He already knew about it
We all fell asleep
She has a bit of a bad temper
Tom is a skillful driver
You can dig for him there
The list is endless
Tom is very resourceful
This message is for Tom
I told Tom Mary would help
I told Tom I would help
Tom and the others left early
Tom entered the room nervously
My sunglasses are broken
You must listen to it
I wanna get paid
Cheaters never prosper
Your words provoked his anger
Drink more water
Wait
Winter is my favourite season
Choose your favourite racket
Finland needs you
He was shivering from the cold
He gave me several books
I had such a lovely night
We learnt nothing at school
This is a proverb
I study at the university
This is an apple tree
This fish is delicious
Tom has bad eyesight
Tom has fallen into the river
Tom fell into the river
Tom has a weak heart
Thanks to both of you
Tom is good at telling jokes
The car is green
The car is brown
The car is grey
The car is red
The car is black
The car is white
The car is yellow
The car is orange
The car is good
The car is bad
The woman is tall
This is a beautiful country
You deserve a prize
I love it when he does that
Tom is not a communist
The tall man is handsome
The handsome man is tall
The tall woman is beautiful
The beautiful woman is tall
We have to speak
I should not have trusted you
You said that you loved him
You said that you loved her
She must be mad at me
She must be mad at you
He must be mad at me
He must be mad at you
He put his arms around her
Tom asked me out this weekend
That information is classified
You know I love you
This makes absolutely no sense
Tom is in a bad mood now
Tom is in a bad mood right now
Tom sat on a chair
He has to be stopped
She has to be stopped
They have to be stopped
Tom has to be stopped
I hope she marries
A lonely old man lives there
Those clocks got broken
It will take some time
I guess he really loves me
I guess she really loves me
Toronto never disappoints
I want Mary brought to justice
Let me reassure you
His hands are never still
All his hopes have vanished
Common sense is instinct
Enough of it is genius
He never cared much for me
Pardon me
He kept the letter
Tom faked his own death
I like him better this way
Streets are not just for cars
I see no point in doing it
Relax and take the test
The test is easy
The test was easy
This is a flag
Thou art God
Manias can be alarming
The plan backfired
Make a virtue of necessity
A life for a life
The absent party is not faulty
Every tide has its ebb
First impressions are lasting
Four eyes see more than two
He will not be ready
She will not be ready
I wish I were an only child
Yes
Tom made a fortune in oil
Tom lives alone in a big house
Speak for yourselves
The streetcar was packed
I travel around a lot
This man is a doctor
This woman is a doctor
This is not the entrance
Looks like you are busy
Tom is back with his ex
He makes me laugh
I made you guys something
We are all going to hell
They already did that
We already did that
He already did that
She already did that
You already did that
I lost a bet
I will come tomorrow
The thought was there
See you in two days
Tom is hard to handle
Mary has not arrived yet
Stop bad mouthing Tom
Tom fell from the tree
Tom is thickheaded
Tom keeps tropical fish
Tom looks down on women
Tom is a strapping young man
Tom has long legs
Tom ran at full speed
I fully agree
She wore a yellow ribbon
Bring him here
Tom made the catch
The kids are finally asleep
We really have no choice
I decided not to eat
I decided not to drink
I have a red car
Tom ordered a spanakopita
That is a brazen lie
I honestly have no idea
I just love this place
This place is fantastic
The Tesla is an electric car
He is teaching me
Tom is a venture capitalist
Everyone is coming with us
I should change the sentence
You should change the sentence
English is spoken in the UK
English is spoken in the USA
Fernando is faster than you
Tom is an amateur astronomer
Tom used up all the hot water
The guys all made fun of him
The girls all made fun of him
This was my plan all along
Your hair looks so nice
I got some shampoo in my eyes
That is a very good idea
I go out after dinner
The road ahead will be long
I felt dizzy when I got up
Bring me the flute
I love someone
They are satisfied
Sleep well tonight
Sweet dreams
I want to go east
The moon represents my heart
Hurry up
I am Wang Wei
This is really good
Buy this one
Tom and I used to be roommates
All this is strange to me
Be sure and wear your overcoat
Go straight across the square
Go straight home
I broke out into a cold sweat
I can still walk straight
I intend to stay for a week
I need some summer clothes
I take my vodka straight
It strikes me as a bit unusual
Make sure Tom comes
My money has been stolen
My shirt is torn at the elbow
Put the potatoes on the stove
State your business
Stop teasing Mary
Stop yawning and stretching
Straighten your tie
Strike out the last paragraph
Supper is ready
That supports my arguments
The sun just went down
They struck oil here recently
They surrendered to the Allies
This hole should be stopped up
This method is slow but sure
This needs a steady hand
Tom has made steady progress
Tom is sweating like a pig
Tom stretched out on the couch
Tom swears too much
Try to get the story straight
We finally struck a bargain
We stormed the enemy positions
Tom made his position clear
Go get some sleep
I think everybody knew that
I think everybody knew that
Tom hurried out of the room
Pray to the Holy Virgin
What you said made Tom angry
Your hair looks nice
His ancestors would be proud
I love someone
Tomorrow is Saturday
The cat was stuck in the tree
This could get interesting
I saw them kissing
I usually sleep soundly
You must write more neatly
You have come too soon
I will be happy to go
Success is never blamed
I wanted to read them
Today was a pleasant day
It is free of charge
Love makes the time pass
Time makes the love pass
Tom can dance like a robot
You look great in this picture
She makes more money than I do
I must disagree with you
I hate myself sometimes
Suicide is dangerous
No one is perfect
My name is Mary
My name is Tom
Brazil lost a great artist
Between space and time
Tom makes more money than Mary
He filled the cup to the brim
He has a talent for music
I love Mary
It was good while it lasted
This is very important to me
He had a leg amputated
That camera over there is mine
Tom is obviously exhausted
Tom must be mad at me
Tom already did that
We trusted him
We trusted her
I guess Tom really loves me
Tom was unsure which way to go
Tom looked down the corridor
Tom looked through the file
Tom owns a car dealership
Tom paced back and forth
Please tell me how to do this
They have to go to school
Tom has been with Mary all day
You only have one life
You are really talented
She has written several books
I promise
You are a very patient teacher
Tom is a very handsome boy
Just do it already
Just do it already
No one told me about that
Tom is a famous chef
The words escaped my lips
He has a lot female friends
He bought me roses
You should not have said that
We should hang out more often
Poverty is no vice
I got another job
Tom tried to calm Mary down
Tom eventually told the truth
I need to buy some rat poison
I was born to make you happy
Tom is introverted and shy
They know him
They said they know you
They know you
Mary works in human resources
Tom has an identical twin
This is a unique situation
Nothing is permanent
They are hiding
Tom is just an average Joe
I know exactly who it is
I heard that she was pregnant
Tom is a rocket scientist
February is over
They sat under the pergola
Nobody noticed me
Tom is a terrible driver
This is a such good student
I got hurt
I keep studying languages
That is really interesting
They wanted me out of the way
This is my coach
I have not let you down
Mary is an activist
Your hair is perfect
Many people do this
Mary is a freelance writer
We made a deal
I saw this in a movie
He will write soon
He came soon
We did talk about it
We always take a bus
I always take a bus
Aso
You ought to eat more
We won six to two
Toss the ball to Tom
Tom was dying of thirst
Tom tore the letter to bits
Tom spoke in an angry tone
Tom is the man for the job
Tom is a true scientist
Tom has a very thick accent
Those pants are much too long
They almost touch the ground
This tooth hurts
This has been a trying day
Think nothing of it
They work together very well
They did it themselves
Their house is near here
The sky is cloudy today
The meat is too tough to eat
The fog is getting thick
That really was a tough break
Thanks for your trouble
Put the top of your car down
Please send them my regards
My toes are frozen
My apartment needs touching up
Let them decide
It was no trouble at all
It rained throughout the night
It looks as though it may rain
I trust you slept well
I like this room
I intend to stay a whole week
I have to go now
I have to get my teeth fixed
I ate a whole lot of cookies
Give me some of those
Come here this minute
Buy some toys
Apply this cream to your face
Wait
The cats seem very happy
Today has been a good day
I like strawberries very much
Hurry up
This is not a threat
All we can do is pray
He caught a mouse
Tom slumped back in his chair
Nature concentrated
The winter has been very cold
The winter was cold and snowy
We have not had much snow
Temptations can be got rid of
By yielding to them
Today it is cold
They gave us one last chance
He gave me one last chance
She gave me one last chance
Tom is a very clever man
Tom realized Maria was tired
Tom is somewhat older than I
I promised not to say anything
This has to be our secret
Everything happened so fast
He made me promise not to tell
Unfortunately it was a guy
Her hair is dry
I should have called first
Read chapter four by Friday
I love this album
I borrowed your pillow
Tom has thinning gray hair
They swim very quickly
You swim very quickly
There are standard behaviors
There is a shared knowledge
There is a shared language
It is a very pragmatic culture
You prefer a paperback edition
My older sister is beautiful
I go shopping every morning
He showed him a bird
Tell me your names
Sleeping is for the weak
I was expelled from school
Tom brews his own beer
Tom brews his own beer at home
Tom makes his own wine
Tom makes his own wine at home
The tree is sick
My tree looks sick
My tree looks sick
My goldfish looks sick
Gyoza that Maria made herself
I love secrets
The snake ate the crocodile
Ann is doing an invitation
The games must go on
I married foreigners
There goes my class teacher
She called the psychiatrist
I think we are in agreement
She was about to leave
I got a job offer
Nobody understands you
Everyone likes them
Respond
The rent is far too high
My wife keeps to a strict diet
I had this illness before
That sounds strange
I had my shoes polished
Tom nodded in agreement
In war the law stays silent
He kissed her hand
He gave her a kiss on the hand
Repeat the same for left
Tom was a patient of mine
Summer has come early
He was starting to bore me
According to you
I got the house number wrong
It is a complete mistake
I cannot take this anymore
We were outside
I have to get going
Tom unclenched his fist
Tom looks pretty drunk
This is a green apple
This is a school
She thinks that she can sing
She made me sell the dog
She had the dog sold
I ate the yoghurt
I saw them kill it
I saw it being killed
This is an apple
This is a pear
It hurts like hell
Let it speak to you first
My head is still spinning
Batman is riding his batmobile
Milk is a food for babies
Go find your own
He looked at the picture
Incentives must be introduced
This book is green
The apple is not green
This apple is not red
This is an orange
The apple is not on the table
I want to learn Hawaiian
The pencil is small
The bus is long
Please be quiet
Your biggest enemy is yourself
I can not live without you
You are the only woman for me
I was seething with rage
He gave him the book
This is our first lesson
Our work began to flourish
Kids learn quickly
Your work is making watches
My cellphone has been stolen
I live in Honolulu
It expires tomorrow
It runs out tomorrow
That is undoubtedly a success
A large building stands there
He sees the office
Please bring me eggs
Please bring me fruit
Please bring me porridge
There is gruel
There is fruit
The sponge soaks up water
That pupil fails too often
He has made them all proud
He hates his neighbor
The mortality rate has fallen
Interlingua is easy to learn
I gave the book to my friend
I will arrive in four hours
I go on foot
I am in Bilthoven
I walk to Bilthoven
That costs more than I thought
You deceived your husband
This has my approval
You have made it
Tom speaks Japanese fluently
Meat should not be eaten raw
The Eagle has landed
I was a bit late
Tom tore up the contract
He lived next door to us
She left the last page blank
Nothing
Apology accepted
Let me get back to you on this
Tom bought a condo
I went to a spa with Mary
I need to get my nails done
I like this dress
Weddings are expensive
I knew what he was thinking
I knew what she was thinking
My mom baked cookies for me
I added your name to the list
Tom slid the door shut
Tom slid the door open
The city is a cage
The town is a cage
In winter it snows
He went again
I have them all
Tom wants to lose weight
London has been fun
There are two distinct parts
It was an experiment
Tom stormed out of the room
Tears gushed from her eyes
Life is too cruel
Tom had not paid the rent
You know I hate that
I hope this is the right one
Something came up
Tom has a nice car
Have a nice night
I really need to get going
Tom poured milk on his cereal
He must be happy
The other girls laughed at her
Be prepared for the worst
Tom only told me
Tom told only me
Tom is too old for you
Tom has braces
Tom pinched me
Tom started the fight
Tom hardly ever laughs
I hope Tom is safe
I hope Tom is feeling OK
Tom broke his nose
He tried to help her
He tried to help
They saw a cat in the garden
The dragon saw her
They walked home
That is long
I took the child
You would apply for that job
I bought a ticket
There are people going home
There are two hundred pages
The kittens are rolling
We have about nine students
You have seven blankets
There is only one pillow
She has twenty children
There are eighteen of them
We saw his flock of geese
My ears are ringing
Look at what I made
Tom wants to come
Tom felt excluded
Look what I made
Tom got mad at me
I hope Tom is wrong
This is so unlike you
I will vouch for him
Jesus was a carpenter
Tom has a secret weapon
Tom is a good team player
Tom got up and began pacing
She asked me if I loved her
He has to stay in bed
Our guests are in a hurry
The dictionary is big
The dictionary is small
Tom treated me badly
Tom slept in his car
Tom shaved off his mustache
The tree is able to grow
I can go
Mind your language
Mind your mouth
The apple was tasty
The duck disappeared
She is here
I gave the money to the woman
She was at home at the weekend
All started to laugh
Everybody started to laugh
Tom stayed home all weekend
She drives to the gas station
Melanie has hurt her leg
I lost my bongos there
Tom has hurt his leg
Tom works a lot
Tom has big eyes
The article is terrible
My computer is very slow
My Internet connection is slow
Tom is a bit slow in the head
Tom never comes here
I locked myself in my room
Tom made some scrambled eggs
That was not my question
Violence will not be tolerated
I can handle it from here
I just found Tom
Tom works long hours

Tom leaped out of bed
Tom must have seen me
Tom talks to me a lot
Tom hates his parents
Tom asked me to dance
Tom is a strong man
Tom told me I was cute

Acceptable enough

Tom was scared to do it
Tom is older than you think
Melanie likes eating pizza
Melanie likes music
Melanie knows the truth
I have just spoken
I remember when Tom was a baby
You were tired
I just ate
Tom threatened to kill me
Tom comes from a good family
Everyone got up to leave
Come see for yourself
Surely you can see that
Let me see what we can do
Let me see what I can do
Come see what you think
Come and see for yourself
Tom bought a hybrid
Tom bought a hybrid car
Coming back was a bad choice
Come and take a look
I just felt it
Someone is going to see you
Thank you for seeing me
Thank you for seeing us
Thanks for seeing me
What Tom saw made him nervous
What Tom saw made him unhappy
Have Tom come see me
I just came by to say thanks
Now come with me
Please come and get me
Please come with me
See what you can come up with
Someone will come for you
Tell them something came up
Tell them to come here
Tell Tom to come here
Thank you for coming back
Thank you for coming by
Thank you for coming in
Thank you for coming today
Thank you for coming tonight
Thank you for coming with me
Thanks for coming with me
These came for you
This came for you this morning
This came for you
Tom came out on top
Tom came to pick me up
Tom comes from a small town
Tom comes from the south
Tom has come a long way
You can come in if you want
This is very important to us
He was bartering information
Tom went upstairs to his room
Tom moved closer to Mary
Tom likes helping others
Tell Tom what Mary told you
I told you you could do it
Maybe we could go dancing
Maybe we could collaborate
Maybe we could make a deal
Maybe you could get a bike
You could be mistaken
This land is ideal for farming
Satan is pleased
I live on a farm
Tom raises rabbits for meat
Nobody cares about your life
These plants are all poisonous
These look like spinach plants
It barely ever rains here
A bad thing never dies
Today my baby was born
He loves me and I love him too
I really hate myself right now
The matter is settled
Thanks
He texts me all the time
She texts me all the time
You can use your imagination
I still love him very much
I still love her very much
Tom texts me all the time
I love spending time with him
I love talking to him
I love talking to her
I love spending time with her
I love spending time with Tom
I enjoy talking with Tom
I love spending time with Mary
I enjoy spending time with Tom
I wish you could meet him
I wish you could meet her
I wonder why Tom did that
I think Tom is too old for me
Tom is too old for me
I found this in her purse
Just get back to work
Everything will be all right
Everything will be fine now
Things will go your way soon
Tom can fix anything
Tom will take care of it
I never had to worry about Tom
I think Tom worries too much
Just relax and quit worrying
Just tell Tom not to worry
Leave the worrying to us
Stop worrying about me
Stop worrying so much
Tell Tom to stop worrying
The patients all worried
Tom told me not to worry
Try not to worry about it
Try not to worry about Tom
Try not to worry so much
You can tell Tom not to worry
You let me worry about that
You let us worry about that
There is a lot to do
He comes from France
She comes from France
This is the door
I expect you to use it
She is my teacher
He was exhausted
I would like to write a book
The man is young
The man is strong
The soldiers follow the leader
The animals run
Come here and help
But life is hard
I walk to the house
The friend educates the friend
They are normal people
I work for much time
I look over to Melissa
Dicaeopolis is not present
I hear the noise
I enjoy being honored by you
I have to sweep my room
They acclaimed him emperor
I did what Tom needed me to do
I did what Tom told me to do
I know Tom is up to something
I realized Tom was right
Tom reached for his cell phone
Tom tried to warn Mary
You have a task to complete
Even Rome was built in one day
She is jealous
Her concert was unreal
She is longing for city life
Go to red alert
Your death will be painless
Mary and I work together
I feel depressed
Hasten slowly
War is the father of all
My name is Nobody
Nothing in excess
Cretans always lie
Either with it or on it
Stand out of my sun
Ever to excel
There is learning in suffering
Always seeking the truth
Those about to die salute you
Love rests on no foundation
Mary is a former model
He spoke to me in German
Tom asked me to marry him
Tom walked out of the movie
I walked out of the movie
We walked out of the movie
My calculator made a mistake
He is quite athletic
These goats are playful
Rabbits love carrots
I find you quite attractive
I urged him to quit smoking
He is not the same as before
You have to learn more
She got arrested
She was arrested
That looks somewhat dangerous
There are lives at stake
There are ducks on the pond
I got no response from anyone
The dates are often wrong
You see ghosts in the daylight
He must pay for his crimes
This sofa is made of hemp
You have to answer his letter
I do not dictate your lessons
The wind began to blow
She pulled at her heartstrings
He pulled at his heartstrings
She pulled at his heartstrings
The boy scratched his ear
Gimme three
Tom is afraid to ask for help
Everything has its limits
He had huge mood swings
She had huge mood swings
His sons have gone to Tokyo
My book is here
Of course not
That is quite impossible
Tom is obsessed with trains
A monarch had six sons
You can do no more for me
I am going to shop
Milk gives me a stomachache
Take a picture with your phone
Stop fighting
I asked for a refund
A year later they were married

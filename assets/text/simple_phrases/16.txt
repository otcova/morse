They are human
They often invent stories
They decided to marry
They bathed in the lake
They are of kin to each other
They labored in the factories
They made love last night
They set out last night
They live in our block
They found out a new method
They advanced on the town
They seem to go together
They went on board a liner
They feared being overheard
They attended worship
They sued for peace
I have seldom heard from her
Her skirt fits tightly
Her anecdotes amuse us all
Her forehead burned with fever
Her face became pink
Her face glowed with health
Her words gave me hope
Her words left him uneasy
Her talent blossomed early
Her bedroom is just above
Her anger gave way to sorrow
Her election is in the bag
All her motions were graceful
Her hat matches her shoes
She entered her twenties
She is above telling a lie
She is a credit to her class
She took the case to court
Her eyes settled on the dress
She wrung the towel dry
She shed bitter tears
She adores cats
She went by the name of Bess
She cannot tell the time yet
She blinked to stop the tears
She recovered her senses
She has a love of music
She saw play after play
She is loved by everyone
She is keen to go abroad
She is married to a foreigner
She is partial to sweets
She is in the wrong
She fairly jumped for joy
She was in a sad state
She was taken ill on holiday
She jumped about in excitement
She stood before the mirror
She is a blonde girl
She is really in good health
She is absorbed in her study
She is forbidden to go out
She is accustomed to sitting
She sat up late last night
She is very exact in her job
She is gentle with children
She gave me a charming smile
She was very short with me
She is the only friend I have
She is brave for a girl
She is handy with a needle
She is ignorant of the world
She is weak by nature
She is an American by birth
She hushed her baby to sleep
She is far from beautiful
She is an early riser
She is getting breakfast ready
She rang off angrily
She traveled round Japan
She is reluctant to marry him
She talked back to him
She cocked an eye at him
She asked after his father
She regarded him as stupid
She is a very refined lady
She is an estate agent
She is just a wallflower
She is afraid of barking dogs
She expanded her cheeks
She is my dream girl
She boasts about her daughter
She is evidently sick
She is used to staying up late
She is a noted singer
She is a slave of fashion
She is a poor cook
She is in a green dress
She is easily moved to tears
Forget the sad affair
I use birth control
Prices go on rising
Business as usual
I have watery stools
I am constipated
Mother often got angry with us
Mother has gone shopping
Apply a bandage
The bill passed both Houses
I went there umpteen times
It took me an hour by train
It makes me feel cheerful
Explain it in plain language
Day began to break
Explain it in plain words
It must be the postman

The leaves turn to gold
Lust denies need
Benefits are in effect
Extremes meet
Thanks for the tip

Really
It seemed the best way forward

He is a storyteller and a poet
The boy bought a dog
The girl has a beautiful doll
The books are ours
Italy is a beautiful land

He likes to learn it by heart
How weird
Our task is to repair a wall
You are not actually an idiot
I cannot get enough of it
I may have to change tack

Good morning Tom
He spoke for the entire hour
Hurry up and go to bed
I have ten children
Live life a little easier
Close
Just missed
Just fell short

You stole
I enlarged the photos
My house is by the lake
That child ought to be in bed
I have been there
I drank a cup of coffee

No pill will help
Even aspirin fails

They were slow
Write this in English
Aye
Thirty years have gone by
I gave you this scar
Everybody but him laughed
He called Uncle Mezyan
Many will want it
The room was unlit
The air was cold
The air is chilly
This is a string instrument
Lots of people are about
The cafe is quiet
Only a few people are about
Your room is quite minimalist
I have a rosy outlook on life
We painted the wall red
I speak Danish
Change your ways
The professors had a spat
Dates help with constipation
Make some music
Yanni finally called his dad
Ziri was in his bedroom
You will pass through Ath Rzin

Ziri sped right past Rima
Yanni had another few drinks
Sorry
I am a pure Edoite

Yanni was walking backwards
Yeah
It broke my heart
He is just a beginner
The bobbin thread ran out
I stopped eating
We swapped shifts with Tom
Ziri has got to have patience
Ziri and Rima can be friends
Ziri had a sandwich
Yanni is quite right
Ziri was not happy about that
That is our pet dog Odie
Ziri is an Algerian rapper
I saw the picture
Ziri is an electrician
He is the winner
You should find a new partner
Yanni liked freak shows
Tebboune is clearly well liked
I made her lose her temper
I made him lose his temper
Pancakes taste good
Algeria is short on dollars

Neither Ziri nor Rima came out
Ziri exposed himself
Ziri downloaded Tinder
I would like some tequila
I was too short
I give up
Just do what you like
I am not at home
Ziri has had many gilrfriends
Ziri never tried to apologize
Thanks for your invitation
The apples start to rot
I pick up Tom
I am seriously wounded
The girl fell asleep
He is a heavy smoker
I am going to take you home
That is none of your business
I wrote a new book
His skin is smooth
John likes to play chess
The One to rule them all
Their plan sounds interesting
A leaf is part of a plant
We see John going to church
I just formatted my computer

We have
He has
The loudest he can
The loudest she can
Merry Christmas
Tatoeba sucks
We need to retaliate
I need ammo
He was born to be an engineer
The color is beautiful
The color is nice
The color is lovely
Tom is a cheapskate
This logo is really ugly
This logo is hideous
This logo needs to be reworked
I need a female interpreter
Afterwards my task is to wait
The war lasted four years
Then she fell silent
Life is deadly
This room is really snug
I have no time for that
He has no time for that
She has no time for that
They have no time for that
Her emotions were in turmoil
His emotions were in turmoil
He made a tweet
She made a tweet
He was staying on the podium
Tie your horse to that stake
This scenery is picturesque
The cats are buying Alemu
I can take the rest
These two are similar
I will whip up a salad
I kindled a fire using twigs
Grandma has made a Swiss roll
The Swedish winter is dark
Ziri was exhausted
I rephrased the sentence
I saw her in their yard
You are kind
Stay true to your morals
Thanks
Of course
I caught this fish
Never do this again
His goons are here to kill us
Tom was an average dog
Mary chased Tom to his death
I have found it
An election is in the offing
God is watching all of it
The confirmation came out
He challenged the system
Thanks
Yeah
The elevator is descending
My gas gauge is on empty
Keep an eye on the fuel gauge
The wine is in the marketplace
She is a dressmaker
He is a tailor
He is a designer
I bought a new fabric
I need buy two bolts of fabric
I need to sew a wool skirt
Try to open it with this
They died for nothing
They died in vain
Russian people are my friends
These are olives
I would like ten cookies
I like Turkish songs
Wine costs twenty coins
Give me a cookie
Now I can die in peace
Our bodies seemed to be one
A thousand emotions invaded me
There are words in Spanish
I take the stairs up
It is full of Kanjifolk
I sit by the stairs to sip
It is delicious
I take the escalator down
I take the escalator up
I miss the comforts of home
The donkey galloped
The donkey was galloping
The donkey jumped around
A donkey was jumping around
A donkey was galloping
Tom draws caricatures of me
Mary was in high heels
I love him like crazy
Mary was wearing stilettos
He turned a sweet smile on her
I recognized that voice
This is a live broadcast
A live broadcast is starting
The door closed with a thud
I was unable to move
Music played softly

I had a severe headache
I had a splitting headache
Tom walks like a zombie
You should be the one to die
Tom said I was going to die
Tom knew he was going to die
No one else needs to die
Nobody deserves to die
Tom is a tough cookie
Tom is one tough cookie
That would be a lie
Tom is a sweetie pie
Tom ripped off his bow tie
Tom is as nutty as a fruitcake
You were a mistake
It was an honest mistake
That was an honest mistake
Tell Tom to take a hike
I can make a call if you like
I can do that if you like
I can look at that if you like
Tell me this is a joke
Tom laughed at the joke
My life is like a sick joke
Tom had a minor stroke
It was a fluke
Tom was very pale
I think we made a sale
That is unavoidable
Tom seems approachable
It was unthinkable
It seems perfectly reasonable
Tom is lying on the table
Tom left the book on the table
Get that off my table
Tom tends to be unpredictable
It might be profitable
I was just being hospitable
It made me uncomfortable
It was rather uncomfortable
Tom is extremely unstable
That meal was incredible
The whiskey was horrible
Tom was responsible
A great deal more is possible
Tom was irresistible
I always expect trouble
Tom knew this meant trouble
Tom hopped on his motorcycle
I have to skedaddle
Tom turned the handle
It cost me a bundle
Tom tossed Mary a rifle
Tom made a grab for the rifle
Tom was an imbecile
Let me have the file
Tom went through the file
We like to keep a low profile
Tom waited a while
That could take a while
Tom continued after a while
Tom has been at it a while
Tom tried to muster a smile
I make you smile
You need to shut your pie hole
Tom peeked out the peephole
It was quite simple
The process is simple
I know how to read people
Tom has murdered three people
I take care of people
Tom knows how to help people
Tom is surrounded by people
These are my people
We make quite a couple
We have some things to settle
Tom stiffened a little
Tom stammered a little
It scares me a little
Tom drew back a little
Tom quickly hid the bottle
You almost had me
I have patients who need me
You already thanked me
It bothered me
Tom immediately recognized me
Say you understand me
They must not have heard me
Tom is trying to provoke me
Tom was the manager before me
I need someone to believe me
I need you to believe me
I just want Tom to love me
You can owe me
It was selfish of me
I know what people think of me
Just stay in front of me
They wormed it out of me
Thanks for asking me
Thanks for telling me
Thanks for not telling me
Stop protecting me
Stop tormenting me
Your secret will die with me
I brought my gun with me
Please bear with me
Nothing can be hidden from me
Tom hid things from me
Move away from me
No one believes in me
Tom took a chance on me
Tom threatened to tell on me
Tom sometimes drops in on me
Tom turned to me
One of them spoke to me
Apologies mean nothing to me
Tom meant everything to me
Please come back to me
Stand up when you talk to me
Now you listen to me
Tom made himself known to me
You seem real familiar to me
They did things to me
That used to mean a lot to me
That really meant a lot to me
Tom made a polite bow to me
Tom is sure to try and stop me
Cut up my food for me
You might put in a word for me
That goes double for me
Tom was there for me
Tom has got it in for me
Tom is covering up for me
You have no respect for me
His name escapes me
Tom intrigues me
I think Tom suspects me
You have to look at me
Tom looked up at me
Everybody yells at me
Tom looked straight at me
Tom looked right at me
Tom is lying to protect me
Tom is out to get me
Tom was going to shoot me
I just need you to trust me
I had to make you trust me
Tom was going to betray me
I needed you and you came
Tom is definitely off his game
Tom was happy for a time
Tom laughed all the time
You tell me that all the time
You need to make time
I owe you big time
You and I go back a long time
We should be there in no time
Tom is still stalling for time
Tom was playing for time
I was just playing for time
It was before my time
We should talk sometime
You need some downtime
You better come
I came to give you a ride home
Welcome to our humble home
I need to come home
Find Tom and bring him home
I can at least take Tom home
You can finish it at home
Have a safe journey home
Tom is indeed quite handsome
Somebody sabotaged this plane
Tom uncorked the champagne
I paid a fine
Tom never varies his routine
Tom tasted the wine
Tom took another swig of wine
Have a good one
I could use one
Tom knew no one
The odds are two to one
Let me be your plus one
You can sleep on that one
I was wrong about that one
Your path is a difficult one
I totally owe you one
You told me I was the only one
The deal is done
I think I just heard someone
They were gone
Tom looks pretty far gone
The magic is gone
The truck is gone
I need you gone
Get me Tom on the phone
Tom went over to the telephone
Tom was glad to be alone
Tom might arrive alone
I had a kidney stone
Tom never killed anyone
Tom was smart enough to escape
Tom is wearing a stethoscope
I had one last hope
You were our last hope
It might be our only hope
It may be your only hope
Tom is at the end of his rope
I know the type
We are what we are
I accept you for who you are
I can see how upset you are
I can sense how upset you are
I can sense how angry you are
Tell us where they are
You can walk for all I care
I believe you do care
Tell me why you care
There was a bomb scare
Tom gave Mary an icy glare
Tom gave Mary an icy stare
I have nothing to add here
I want guards posted here
I like the people here
I happen to live here
I want Tom out of here
I can get us out of here
I can get you out of here
Tom said you could work here
You two get in here
Tom is the floor manager here
I think Tom slept here
We can work something out here
Tom just stood there
I must be there
Tom just left me there
You have to get out of there
There was something there
You really had me going there
I can rent a boat from there
I knew I had been there
We almost bought it in there
We were almost there
You were almost there
You did pretty good out there
There are wolves out there
I can get you there
Everyone has to be somewhere
Everybody has to be somewhere
It had to come from somewhere
Just put them anywhere
I can work from anywhere
They seem to be everywhere
We have branches everywhere
Tom tended to the fire
Your garbage can is on fire
Tom is a new hire
Tom began to perspire
I was asked to wear a wire
We know the score
Tom has heard it all before
I needed something more
Tom could say nothing more
Tom could do no more
Tom could say no more
I have a lot more
I had to know more
Tom was impossible to ignore
Tom swore
Tom was insecure
I needed to be sure
This is an unexpected pleasure
Tom has a forgiving nature
The opposite is the case
Tom is obviously a mental case
Tom is carrying a briefcase
Tom aims to please
Tom examined the new purchase
I always like wine and cheese
I wanted to bring you these
I needed the exercise
Tom made a noise
Tom feigned surprise
That was a fun surprise
Tom showed no surprise
The charges were false
Tom was killed someplace else
Let me tell you something else
I like things to make sense
It made a lot of sense
That makes a lot of sense
Tom is devoid of common sense
Tom was talking nonsense
The mood is tense
The crew is tense
Tom made no response
Tom was paid to lose
That was too close
Boy that was close
Tom held Mary close
It just gets worse
It only got worse
Tom heard sounds in the house
Tom set me up on a date
Tom is dressed for a date
Tom is resigned to his fate
I will accept my fate
Tom exited through the gate
It was totally inappropriate
They stayed late
I guess Tom is running late
That could be too late
Tom was too late
That was why I was late
Tom was hours late
We have a lot to celebrate
Tom was so considerate
I know how you operate
I grew desperate
I have a friend in real estate
My happiness is complete
Tom is all bark and no bite
Half the suspects were white
I feel like a hypocrite
Tom glanced at the note
I call for a vote
Tom has excellent taste
Tom paused to have a cigarette
Tom lit another cigarette
That was very cute
They should be out in a minute
Tom is in no position to argue
Tom is in the morgue
That was the first clue
The rumors are true
Tom appeared from the cave
Tom led the way into the cave
Tom made no move to leave
I must ask you to leave
Something has to give
I need Tom alive
At least we know Tom is alive
Tom will eat you alive
We must take the offensive
Go on the offensive
I have a lot of initiative
Tom was always secretive
Tom is being held captive
I just want to feel your love
Tom is on the move
This is the right move
I can barely move
I came by to apologize
Tom might at least apologize
This is such a relief
Tom sighed with relief
Tom began to sniff
Tom is pretty bad off
Tom stormed off
They shoved off
Call your people off
You ticked them off
Tom was definitely bought off
They blew you off
You were told to lay off
I like to sleep in the buff
This is emotional stuff
You know your stuff
I need help with this stuff
Tom braced himself
Tom helped himself
Tom cursed himself
Tom hated himself
Tom tried to prepare himself
Tom was ashamed of himself
Tom was sure of himself
Tom seems very full of himself
Tom was defending himself
Tom looks pleased with himself
Tom is going to kill himself
Tom lost confidence in himself
Tom snickered to himself
You must be kicking yourself
Just keep to yourself
Please cover yourself
Just see for yourself
Just look at yourself
You even said that yourself
The cycle is repeating itself
I can drive myself
I have to think of myself
I was defending myself
I can live with myself
I smiled to myself
I can figure it out myself
I could kill you myself
Tom was aloof
I need solid proof
Mary rummaged through her bag
Tom is a scumbag
Tom was waving a flag
Shake a leg
Tom lost a leg
Last one in is a rotten egg
Last one out is a rotten egg
I knew it was pretty big
This is very disturbing
Tom resumed his pacing
I know where this is leading
I might need some persuading
My ears were pounding
The alarm started ringing
Tom began laughing
You look positively ravishing
I could ask you the same thing
I could say the same thing
Promise me one thing
This all adds up to one thing
We want one thing
Tom was right about one thing
You just said the wrong thing
Tom has indeed found something
I think we found something
You are something
Tom could sense something
I just want to feel something
Tom was munching on something
I need to confess something
It might tell us something
I knew I felt something
That should tell you something
I had to say something
Tom is perplexed by something
Tom denied nothing
The fight had settled nothing
Tom heard nothing
We could see nothing
Tom could see nothing
They could see nothing
Tom ate nothing
We could end up with nothing
Tom could do nothing
Tom is good for nothing
Tom has got nothing
Try not to steal anything
Nobody could tell Tom anything
It could mean anything
Tom noticed everything
That has changed everything
That should solve everything
Tom has a plan for everything
People tell doctors everything
Your hand is shaking
Please refrain from talking
People will start talking
Tom spoke without thinking
The light was blinking
They were out late drinking
Pardon me for asking
It does sound appealing
I just had a weird feeling
It gave me a nice feeling
Keep hustling
This is quite puzzling
The crowd was screaming
Someone knew we were coming
You all had this coming
I never saw that coming
Tom had it coming
The noise is deafening
Tom may be dead before morning
We had some words this morning
Tom sent me roses this morning
This is your own doing
I know where this is going
You have very acute hearing
I can end your suffering
It just sounds boring
Dinner was incredibly boring
Tom may need some doctoring
Tom is quite enterprising
Tom is incapable of losing
You need to stop obsessing
We ended up kissing
One of them is still missing
It was very confusing
That was really quite amusing
This is really humiliating
Today has been exhilarating
Dinner will be waiting
Tom was waiting
Tom sat waiting
Tom has a talent for writing
Tom really likes your painting
They were arguing
Every life is worth saving
Tom works for a living
There was soft music playing
My friend here will be paying
Tom began praying
The girls were crying
It was absolutely amazing
That would take too long
Tom has been lying all along
You two would get along
It made me strong
It just seems so wrong
It feels wrong
Tom was invariably wrong
That was a really pretty song
Tom and Mary were young
The crowd is young
I chose the wrong approach
Tom let out a belch
Tom is progressing in French
Tom complained of the stench
I had a drink with lunch
This will hold me until lunch
We can work on it at lunch
Tom beat us to the punch
Tom is quite the catch
This is just too much
I can only take so much
You give me so much
Tom loves you so much
I suspected as much
I had suspected as much
I never minded all that much
Tom liked Mary very much
Tom slumped on the couch
The cotton is high
Tom gave a sigh
Tom said that for the laugh
That better be good enough
That seems simple enough
It looks harmless enough
Use whatever you wish
Believe whatever you wish
That was very harsh
It was an ambush
It scares me to death
Tom drew a long breath
Tom drew a deep breath
Tom drew a sharp breath
Tom drew in his breath
Let Tom find his own path
I had to find my own path
I chose another path
Tom is lying through his teeth
Tom began to brush his teeth
Tom is the one I deal with
Tom is going away for a month
Tom has got quite a mouth
Go with the truth
I just tell the truth
We already know the truth
You already know the truth
I came by to say hi
Tom makes an excellent martini
Tom hailed a cruising taxi
Tom forced himself to speak
Tom opened his mouth to speak
Tom wanted Mary to speak
We got a break
I could really go for a steak
Tom was too weak
I just want my job back
Tom smiled back
Tom stepped back
I can be laid back
Tom patted me on the back
I just want my career back
Tom and I go a long way back
We go way back
I just want my family back
I think I just hurt my back
The door opened a crack
We must continue our attack
I ought to break your neck
Tom is a total wreck
That was a dirty trick
Tom will be worried sick
This stuff makes me sick
Get in here quick
You catch on quick
I can make this quick
Tom is almost in shock
Circle the block
I suggest you duck
I make my own luck
I admire your pluck
That was last week
I knew people would talk
Tom must be made to talk
Tom is here to talk
People are going to talk
People are starting to talk
You can take that to the bank
Tom ate and drank
I should buy you a drink
Tom refreshed his drink
I just want a quiet drink
It looks like a slam dunk
You smell like a drunk
They were drunk
Please pop the trunk
Tom glanced at the book
I played it by the book
Tom is an open book
Tom is a pretty amazing cook
They exchanged a look
I think we should take a look
Tom gave Mary a stern look
Tom gave Mary an icy look
That guy happens to be a crook
Tom would do whatever it took
Tom speared the shark
Tom laughed at the remark
Tom is obviously a jerk
The crowd went berserk
Stop being such a dork
Being a teacher is hard work
Being a reporter is hard work
This is how we work
I know how hard you all work
I know Tom from work
I need to focus on work
I refuse to work
Tom is dressed for work
Now get on with your work
You know how these things work
Tom settled down to his work
You need to make this work
I know how you guys work
I made it work
I need to make it work
We barely talked about work
I know how hard you work
It was nice of you to ask
Tom drummed on the desk
Tom said it was on his desk
Tom is already at his desk
Tom could be a flight risk
Tom is an obvious flight risk
Timing would be critical
Tom won the sharpshooter medal
Tom is trying to cut a deal
Tom really got a bad deal
Maybe Tom made a good deal
This is the real deal
Tom really got a raw deal
I had a decent meal
We want it to look real
The pain was real
Everything Tom does is illegal
I just want it to be special
You must be very special
It could be beneficial
You were an animal
Tom is completely delusional
Tom is a decorated general
You need a lot more capital
I wound up in the hospital
None of us are immortal
The feeling was mutual
I want to be a role model
I can feel everything you feel
Take the wheel
Let me take the wheel
Tom peered down the tunnel
Tom will end up in jail
Let it go to voicemail
Tom is a tricky little devil
I want to be a daredevil
Tom has no manners at all
Tom remembered it all
I can make a call
You get one phone call
Tom made a bad judgment call
Tom stuck a poster on the wall
Tom is in a holding cell
It was a job done well
Tom remembered Mary quite well
The meeting seemed to go well
That seemed to go well
Tom could dance rather well
I taught you well
It went extremely well
I do pretty well
I hear they pay pretty well
Tom ran on the treadmill
Tom lay perfectly still
Do with it what you will
Tom put me on the payroll
It was half full
Tom tried to play it cool
It sounds really cool
That seems pretty cool
Tom made you look like a fool
Tom is playing you for a fool
Tom disappeared after school
Tom does seem to be in control
Give it a whirl
Tom was grateful
They were ungrateful
They are so beautiful
Black is beautiful
That would be less painful
Tom was quite successful
That was very hurtful
It sounds like a scam
That sounds like a scam
You two will work as a team
Take one for the team
This might all be a sham
This might be all a sham
Their marriage is a sham
You must have dropped them
Someone must have planted them
Tom believed them
Tom was one of them
Hang on to them
Tom glared at them
I felt threatened by them
Tom clearly has a problem
I assume this is the problem
Tom was stumped by the problem
There is an additional problem
Nobody remembers seeing him
Find Tom and kill him
I can sell it to him
Tom was the third victim
Tom loves to play the victim
I must be calm
I just need to stay calm
The girls all liked Tom
Tell us why you killed Tom
We should not have angered Tom
This is between me and Tom
I highly recommend Tom
We must all go and find Tom
I think I know how to find Tom
Show us where you found Tom
That better not be Tom
You sounded just like Tom
It sounds exactly like Tom
I thought you could handle Tom
Let somebody else hire Tom
You must help me save Tom
Get your filthy hands off Tom
Get your hands off of Tom
Get off of Tom
That was the last I saw of Tom
There was no avoiding Tom
Thank you for bringing Tom
There was no escaping Tom
There was no stopping Tom
I could see you marrying Tom
I think we can catch Tom
You did a great job with Tom
I had a talk with Tom
Maybe I can reason with Tom
I have dinner plans with Tom
I can only discuss it with Tom
You never know with Tom
There was another guy with Tom
I know who took Tom
You would have to ask Tom
You look worse than Tom
I never laid a hand on Tom
Maybe I should check on Tom
I think I should check on Tom
The truth began to dawn on Tom
I guess I could go easy on Tom
I regret what happened to Tom
I owe my life to Tom
I know you were close to Tom
It made me feel close to Tom
I wrote back to Tom
All I want is to talk to Tom
Mary looked beautiful to Tom
Try explaining that to Tom
I need to get over Tom
This is extremely hard for Tom
Keep looking for Tom
This directly concerns Tom
Somebody took a shot at Tom
I think I want to meet Tom
You just want to get Tom
You should consult Tom
Someone has to confront Tom
Maybe I hurt Tom
This is going to hurt Tom
I swear I never hurt Tom
I was so wrong about Tom
It seems I was wrong about Tom
I have a theory about Tom
Do your best without Tom
That message was sent by Tom
We might need the extra room
Tom entered the room
Tom glanced round the room
Tom stepped inside the room
I was out of the room
Tom was in the room
Tom showed Mary into the room
Let Tom use my dressing room
Tom glanced round the bedroom
I have to use the bathroom
I have to use the restroom
I know where it came from
I know where I come from
Tom touched my arm
We mean Tom no harm
They were firm
Spare me the sarcasm
Tom is at the podium
Tom did the bare minimum
I need to come clean
The boat was clean
Tom is an excellent physician
It sounds like a plan
That sounds like a plan
We had a master plan
Tom is just an ordinary man
You need a good woman
They are almost human
Tom was an artilleryman
It was a little sudden
Tom is nowhere to been seen
Tom is no spring chicken
Tom reported his car stolen
They were all strong men
This is a product for men
These are dangerous men
The door was kicked open
The window was wide open
The heavy door swung open
The rear gate was open
This is really going to happen
Nothing has to happen
We can make this happen
I could make that happen
Tom leaned forward to listen
Tom leaned down to listen
Tom has already checked in
Tom is all tucked in
You must come in
You should turn yourself in
Anyone could just walk in
Tom paused to let it sink in
Just let Tom in
You should turn in
They want me to go in
Tom let me sleep in
I can get us in
I can get you in
Tom nodded again
Tom whistled again
Tom screamed again
The door opened again
Tom sneezed again
Tom spoke again
You must not fail me again
Tom has lied to me again
Tom has done it to me again
Tom is just crying wolf again
I had that dream again
I never laid eyes on Tom again
The music began again
Tom never turned up again
I read it over again
Tom opened his eyes again
Tom closed his eyes again
Tom shut his eyes again
Tom went upstairs again
Tom never wore that hat again
All is quiet again
Tom became angry again
Let the games begin
Tom rubbed his chin
They were thin
Tom is getting under my skin
Tom played you like a violin
You better win
Try to hang on
Tom felt a headache coming on
So much is going on
Tom is beginning to catch on
The ceiling fan is on
We value your opinion
Tom will need some persuasion
I await your decision
I need it to be my decision
I just had a vision
We need a diversion
Tom suffered from depression
You have a nasty concussion
I had a revelation
This is only a simulation
You were my inspiration
I can make a reservation
Take evasive action
I think Tom won the election
I could never win an election
Tom had no ambition
I have a skin condition
I know about your condition
You know my position
That was never an option
Tom was put up for adoption
Tom sidestepped the question
It was a legitimate question
I have just one small question
We have an elegant solution
It was a great afternoon
Your time will come soon
Tom looked for a weapon
Tom had always wanted a son
Tom embraced his son
You said Tom loved his son
Tom was friends with my son
Get away from my son
I think Tom is still in prison
Tom went to prison
Tom is just an ordinary person
Tom is stationed in Boston
I need you in Boston
Tom feigned concern
This is no time to be stubborn
We need time to mourn
I have nowhere else to turn
I want something in return
I may not return
You used to be so much fun
Let Tom have his fun
The guy had a gun
We have them on the run
Tom tried to run
Tom started to run
You better run
You will be on your own
The laughter died down
I think Tom has calmed down
The car slowed down
I let my guard down
You wore me down
Pipe down
Put the bag down
Tom feared falling down
Tom put his glass down
They turned us down
I feel like I let you down
The fuse is blown
The circus is in town
You need sleep as much as I do
Tom has the same rash as I do
You know that as well as I do
Tom realized what he had to do
He is much older than her
I have literally nothing to do
Tom loves everything you do
You need to let this one go
Of course Tom will go
Just let the woman go
Tom turned to go
We better go
You better go
You know how these things go
I let it go
You lost me a long time ago
I needed you a long time ago
Tom sang along with the radio
Tom smiled hello
Somebody should say hello
Tom was a war hero
I intend to go on doing so
You were wise to do so
I remember telling you so
I can arrest you if I have to
I forgot who I was talking to
Find somebody to talk to
Tom has nowhere to run to
I need you in my office pronto
We must never confuse the two
These are so cheap
Settle down you two
It must be the company I keep
You had quite a sleep
Tom was allowed to sleep
We just got Tom to go to sleep
You better sleep
Tom was still asleep
Read it and weep
Tom will be denied membership
Tom chewed his lip
Tom is beyond help
I could do with some help
I refuse to help
Tom clearly wants to help

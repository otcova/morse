I just got your message
I just graduated from Harvard
I just had a talk with Tom
I just had breakfast with Tom
I just had my final exam today
I just had our house painted
I just had the weirdest dream
I just had this suit cleaned
I just hate to see Tom cry
I just hate to see Tom lose
I just have a few questions
I just have a lot on my mind
I just have one question
I just have so much on my mind
I just have to make a call
I just heard from Tom
She left with someone else
I only followed the recipe
The car is old but good
What I wist I told to you
Good night
Go back to the seat
I am a girl
The test was rather difficult
This is a wood table
I was overwhelmed
You were overwhelmed
The news overwhelmed her
She struggled for words
I fumbled in my pockets
There is trouble brewing
Portugal is no exception
The pan sizzles
I love cinema
The birds twitter cheerfully
He who sleeps does not sin
She asked for my assistance
He asked for my assistance
All things hidden will be seen
More of these are wonderful
Please drink tea
An arrow pierced his liver
He requested my assistance
He asked me to help
He is jealous
You were not jealous
I was not jealous
We were not jealous
Mary was not jealous
She was not jealous
He looked at me suspiciously
She looked at me suspiciously
It brought a smile to her face
It brought a smile to his face
I knew he was lying
My big sister wants to kill me
I am in cloud number nine
This imbecile has sharp teeth
It is how it is
A lot of snow had just fallen
Her face was covered with cum
It makes no sense whatsoever
I see noblemen and noblewomen
Tom probably tried it
I lost my glasses
Tattoos have tribal origins
Texts are never objective
Somebody called
You must try somewhere else
John is taller than anybody
You may kiss anybody
Every dog has four legs
My jeans shrank
She invited me to her wedding
Picasso was no clown
He is known for his decency
I just heard an alarm go off
I just heard someone scream
I just heard something
I just heard Tom
I just heard Tom is missing
I just heard voices
I just heard you visited Tom
I just hope everything works
I just hope I can help
I just hope I can survive this
I just hope it was worth it
I just hope it works
I just hope this is enough
I just hope Tom is OK
I just hope Tom is safe
I just hung up the phone
I just hurt my back
I just ignore Tom
I just kept my mouth shut
I just kissed Mary
I just learned to play poker
I just left Tom
I just left you a message
I just lost a hundred dollars
I just lost my job
I just love bargain sales
I just love the way Tom talks
I just love the way you look
I just love you so much
I just made a pot of coffee
I just made dinner
I just made it up
I just made Tom partner
I just met a boy named Tom
I just met Tom yesterday
I just might do that
I just miss you
I just moved here
I just moved in yesterday
I just moved in
I just moved to Boston
I just need a break
I just need a little air
I just need a little help
I just need a little more time
I just need a little time
I just need a moment
I just need a second
I just need five minutes
I just need more time with Tom
I just need more time
I just need my own space
I just need one more chance
I just need one more day
I just need some air
I just need some aspirin
I just need some coffee
I just need some information
I just need some more space
I just need some rest
I just need some sleep
I just need some time
I just need time to think
I just need time
I just need to do this
I just need to finish up
I just need to get some sleep
I just need to know who Tom is
I just need to rest a little
I just need to rest
I just need to see for myself
I just need to see Tom
I just need to talk to Tom
I just need to talk to you
I just need to tell you this
I just need Tom for a minute
I just need you to sign here
I just need you to sign this
I just needed a minute
I just needed a place to study
I just needed directions
I just needed more room
I just needed some air
I just needed some space
I just needed some water
I just needed this one
I just needed to know
I just needed to tell someone
I just needed Tom for a second
I just never noticed it before
I just noticed it was Tom
I just noticed it
I just noticed something
I just now found this
I just organized my closet
I just organized my desk
I just picked it up
I just pretend to be a doctor
I just pretended to like Tom
I just ran three miles
I just read a really good book
I just really want to kiss you
I just said that
I just said the same thing
The king must abdicate
Maria walks slowly
Seriously
I just had to get away
I just saw a ghost
I just saw it for myself
I just saw something moving
I just saw Tom and Mary
I just saw Tom last week
I just saw Tom three hours ago
I just signed the contract
I just sold my car to Tom
I just solved the puzzle
I just spoke to Tom over there
I just spoke to Tom
I just spoke with the captain
I just spoke with the police
I just spoke with Tom
I just spoke with your doctor
I just started my own business
I just stopped by to say hello
I just talked to Tom
I just think I should try
I just think Tom was drunk
I just thought it would help
I just thought of a great idea
I just thought you should know
I just threw it away
I just threw it out the window
I just told Tom the truth
I just touched a snake
I just transferred from Boston
I just tried calling you
I just turned thirty
I just want a normal life
I just want it the way it was
I just want it to stop
I just want it
I just want my wife back
I just want out of here
I just want the facts
I just want this to go well
I just want to apologize
I just want to come home
I just want to fit in
I just want to get away
I just want to get home
I just want to get over it
I just want to go

I just want you to go away
I just wanted a coffee
I just wanted another chance
I just wanted it to be over
I just wanted Mary to love me
I just wanted my old life back
I just wanted thirty dollars
I just wanted to apologize
I just wanted to be sure
I just wanted to come home
I just wanted to help Tom
I just wanted to help
I just wanted to know
I just wanted to look at you
I just wanted to make a change
I just wanted to make it right
I just wanted to say good luck
I just wanted to say hi
I just wanted to see Tom
I just wanted to see you again
I just wanted to speak to Tom
I just wanted to talk to Tom
I just wanted to talk to you
I just wanted to tell you that
I just wanted to thank you
I just wanted to try it once
I just wanted to warn you
I just wanted Tom to calm down
I just wanted you to see it
I just wanted your advice
I just went out for a run
I just wish I could remember
I just wish I could sleep
I just wish I knew what it was
I just wish Tom could be here
I just work here
I keep a journal
I keep asking myself that
I keep in touch with Tom
I keep my word
I kept it with me
I kept my end of the bargain
I kept the door locked
I kept to myself
I killed a duck once
I killed them all
I killed them both
I kind of figured that out
I kind of like it here

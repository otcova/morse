He has no heart at all
The fridge is empty
This never happens
They left the room one by one
Enter the delivery address
Enter the address for service
The dress is made of silk
The cat chases the squirrel
The girl likes the music
The dog sleeps
Computers are machines
The air seems damp
The food becomes cold
The potatoes stayed hot
The idea is that you sing
You never told me about this
Cows like to eat grass
He stared straight at her
Everyone must obey the rules
I crave knowledge
Fucking hell
Be careful swimming in the sea
I got it from someone
India is my country
Tom was wearing moccasins
Tom liked teasing his sister
Tom likes teasing his sister
Mary liked teasing her brother
Mary likes teasing her brother
Tom likes most of his teachers
The wind bit her cheeks
The cold wind bit her cheeks
We went on a date by the river
We want to have a baby
She took offense at something
Excuse me
I must use the powder room
She took offence at something
She felt hurt by something
Something offended her
Anyone can hurt a painter
The bar was packed
Anyone can wrong a painter
Her attitude irks me
She was offended by something
I resented his superiority
We are always hungry
They were drinking champagne
Get down on all fours
I woke up gasping for air
Tom seemed surprised by this
The escalator quickly stopped
This is an obscene site
I came home empty handed
The big fish loves the deep
This is a reasonable price
Everyone keeps on smiling
Please let me pass
I am getting bored
I love traveling alone
I stay up late every night
I want to become a singer
I want to become a doctor
I want to read that book
I want to die soon
I wish I were a baby again
I want to eat ramen
I want to eat Chinese noodles
I want to eat pizza
Fuji once again
I want to go there again
I want to go there once again
If only I could help you
You are guilty
The train is about to leave
The train was almost empty
Capricious as April
Sumo is a Japanese martial art
Tom is young and ambitious
A taxi is expensive
Tom is playing outside
I do not believe you
You were always on my mind
You do not know the truth
I am from Turkey
I am looking for a cheap hotel
I could not understand
You must follow the rules
The refrigerator is open
I called on her
He is a terrible fidget
She ran out of money
The gardener was the murderer
They are all on holiday
The murderer was the gardener
The gardener was a murderer
He asked me out to dinner
Tom asked me out to dinner
My daughter sings in the choir
Tom is strikingly handsome
I want to know all the details
I looked the other way
He is dead
He writes poems and novels
Be sincere with me
This is more than exceptional
I am thinking day and night
The kitchen is downstairs
You have to follow the rules
You need to follow the rules
She was an extraordinary woman
He married her for her money
She is homesick
I think
Look at me in the eyes
You needed to arrive earlier
This is smaller than Tokyo
We all knew about it
He rarely writes to his father
I fell into the spikes
There is no way to go there
That is coffee
The patio is very small
Be honest with me
I would have said yes
The planets circle the Sun
Tom is not a true warrior
You can have three guesses
Tom refused to admit it
She refused to admit it
Milk was sold in glass bottles
I hope we can be good friends
The train was ready to depart
He refused to admit it
To execute cannot show mercy
She interrupted me
I need three markers
He interrupted me
Tom sang to Maria
Open your book on page nine
Tom sang for Mary
Tom ran barefoot in the snow
He barely speaks to me anymore
Thanks a lot
I appreciate that
I saw a large snake today
Mary has a cute boyfriend
Tom has a cute girlfriend
Tom has a secret
Your dad is really cool
The pupil has to improve
Tom just sent me an email
Tom is listening to his iPod
Mary was listening to her iPod
Timothy was nicknamed Timmy
Tom kicked the soccer ball
Tom kicked the trash can
She held my hand firmly
Her father died last year
Mr Basri loves his wife
It rained five days in a row
He related his experiences
Now we are seven Arabs
I approve his suggestion
My clothes are full of suds
He is a stranger
I am not widowed
She is a kook
He is a kook
You are being a kook
Life is so unjust sometimes
I like your book
Tom is cooking breakfast
I thought I could trust you
They argue a lot
The school has a dress code
A white boat came into sight
My toes are freezing
Be careful
I can listen to what I want
I will choose one
I will choose one of them
One has to change the words
I cannot continue any longer
Many soldiers were killed here
He was a cruel man
Labor created man
The last guest did that
He puts his money in the bag
That liquid is harmful
That smells nice
I like the way that smells
I never heard from them again
I never heard from her again
Not everyone was happy
We went along the narrow road
The truth is really clear
I went to school
Armin broke the window
Marjane caught the cat
He chopped the carrot
My son went to Iran
He visited Tehran
I was in Iran
Her face was red
She dyed her hair red
I grew up in Shiraz
I lay down on the bed
I lived in Tehran
We are from Germany
He looks unhappy
I approach my destination
I paid attention
The words need rearranging
The man drinks water
Tom works for a small company
Tom slowly retreated
Tom slowly drew back
He watered the rose bush
The schools are closed today
Most schools are closed today
I am a member of the firm
I can employ you in my company
I can hire you in my company
I added yet another sentence
Their honesty is questionable
Their honesty is dubious
You should eat slower
The ground was covered in snow
It was Christmas
It was midnight
Dawn was breaking
There was a cool wind
He was dying
We were roommates
A refreshing breeze blew
You were washed
He was going to be invited
She was very pale
She was miserable
Gandhi was shot dead
It was only a whim
It was only a passing fad
She was away
It was a general strike
That was a passtime
He was sleeping
He had been embarrassed
He had been inconvenienced
He was very drunk
She was very rich
There were various delicacies
We were a couple
We were reading
That was a shepherd
He was an idol
Tom was crying out
Tom was shouting
It was a terrible week
There were two pies
I was talkative
Tom died in Rome
We hope it rains today
Women change the world
You have to be polite
I want to be promoted
They reached their destination
This should be washed
You should wash this
Everything can be used
It is about eight kilometers
Language is a code
It is already August
I have a huge sailboat
The girls laughed loudly
I consume sugar
We welcomed her decision
The natives are restless
The coin is made out of gold
Tom has sex with Mary
Discover a new world
The badger bit the boy
The toilet is small
We have a small house
This area is pressurized
I want to learn Persian
Mary smoothed her hair
Oh no
A young lady came to see him
This ship needs a captain
His lips touched hers
Tom kissed her on both cheeks
Mary kissed him on both cheeks
This is me
One explains the other
I got rid of my old fridge
I love it
She will not come today
Tomorrow
The first lesson is a taster
The state oppresses the people
The bird is in the sky
The conversation is drying up
They talked politics
The answer was easy
We need a timekeeper
I wonder how it came about
I suspected nothing
Tom suspects nothing
You are my closest friend
The plane was coated with dust
I was speaking only German
He takes snapshots
His question puzzles me
I got a bit lost
Sorry to have worried you
They forgot my birthday
I want to see Tom once more
I want to see Tom again
We continued to talk
Tom underestimated Marie
I sat on the sofa
I sat on the couch
Tom is my charge
I am in charge of Tom
I can only speak French
She worked in Belgium
All kinds of women inspire me
My tea is a little too sweet
Come and look for yourself
Keep your ideas to yourself
Explain yourself
Draw a picture of yourself
You need to prepare yourself
You have to defend yourself
Mine is better than yours
You both seem very young
You look a little young
No one will obey you
I think I know you
I can do it without you
I try not to worry about you
Tom knows a lot about you
I often think about you
I want you
Tom will never forget you
Tom will be there to meet you
I really respect you
Look who beat you
Tom keeps looking at you
Tom is laughing at you
The problem is you
Maybe Tom loves you
No one believes you
I hope your new boss likes you
This is just for you
This one is just for you
This is not for you
Come see what I got for you
I intend to do that for you
Let Tom do that for you
The message was for you
This is all for you
Tom will be back for you
The boss was looking for you
Let me cook something for you
These three are for you
Tom left a message for you
Apples are good for you
Someone had to stop you
We should be able to help you
I agree to help you
I intend to help you
I just wanted to help you
I tried to help you
None of us will help you
Let me make it up to you
Tom would like to speak to you
I was speaking to you
Maybe I should join you
We believe in you
Everyone believed in you
They sent me to kill you
Just do as I tell you
Remember that I outrank you
I want to go out with you
I always enjoy being with you
Let me stay here with you
Please take me with you
Tom loves all of you
Good luck to both of you
I lied to both of you
Let me take care of you
Your dad will be proud of you
Tom was afraid of you
I think I believe you
Of course I believe you
Someone will save you
You know that I like you
Tom will be happy to see you
It was really good to see you
Tom will be pleased to see you
I have to trust someone
It might as well be you
I urgently need you
It may not be ready yet
No one has voted yet
Tom was busy yesterday
Tom was lucky yesterday
I told you yesterday
Tom was out yesterday
The surgery was yesterday
It was fun yesterday
I got back to Boston yesterday
I worked until seven yesterday
I arrived yesterday
I got married yesterday
My answer is still yes
I visited Boston last year
Tom was my roommate last year
Tom worked here last year
Spring came late this year
You look sad
Tom knows that he was wrong
You have it all wrong
You never do anything wrong
You did this one wrong
You always get me wrong
It seems well written
Tom is a good writer
Your shirt is wrinkled
You could do worse
Next year will be worse
I expected worse
You have to stop worrying
I have to stop worrying
I try not to worry
This is our world
I bet it works
We hope that it works
It seems that everything works
I want to workout
My plan is working
This time it worked
Tell us where you work
We have to get to work
Tom has gone to Boston to work
We have to get back to work
Tom found a good place to work
I used the wrong word
They went into the woods
This picture is wonderful
Never interrupt a woman
Cut the red wire
I love winter
There can only be one winner
Let me get you some wine
I brought some wine
Go easy on the wine
I washed the windows
Open your window
Stop looking out the window
I always win
May the best man win
Tom knew that Mary would win
Tom knew that he would win
Take off your wig
It looks like a wig
I needed to know why
You must wait a while
My shoes got wet
I was wet
They were wet
I know what my mistakes were
Tell me how it went
I know this city pretty well
I remember it very well
This book sells very well
You play the guitar very well
Tom plays the organ very well
My books sell very well
I speak French very well
I understood very well
They did very well
Tom did very well
We know each other fairly well
This time it went well
Tom can help you as well
Tom and Mary are there as well
Tom will be there as well
Look into the well
They both did well
That job paid well
Some people are just weird
Your eyebrows look weird
Your ideas are weird
We go back to Boston next week
Tom is coming home next week
I sold my car last week
Our band played here last week
I played here last week
We needed this weather
This is unusual weather
Throw down your weapons
Tom went that way
My lawyer is on his way
It always happens the same way
I also feel the same way
Tom drinks a lot of water
Tom wanted to conserve water
I was in the water
Tom wondered who Mary was
I remember what it was
I wonder who it was
I wondered who it was
Tom left without warning
I need a new wardrobe
I forgot what Tom wanted
Think about what you want
Just do what you want
Think what you want
Show me what you want
Call me what you want
Tell me anything you want
Take it home if you want
Call me any time you want
I know what people want
This is all I want
This is the bicycle I want
I forgot my wallet
I prefer walking
I like walking
We were waiting
Your friends are waiting
Tom told Mary to wait
This is a vowel
We never voted
Ask Tom if he voted
No one deserves my vote
I want to vote
This is really volatile
Please lower your voice
I like the sound of your voice
My parents are visiting
I really appreciate your visit
Tom and Mary came to visit
Look at the view
This is my new video
I love this video
I really like this video
I saw the video
Tom wants to be a veterinarian
It has no value
Tom is on vacation
You look uglier than usual
This website is useless
Do something useful
I want to be useful
They threw spears at us
Nobody understands us
Tom did it for us
Tom offered to do that for us
The place is too small for us
They were waiting for us
Tom sacrificed his life for us
Try to convince Tom to help us
Tom has come here to help us
It was Tom who came to help us
They tried to poison us
Ask Tom to join us
Tom is still staying with us
Tom has been living with us
Leave the wine here with us
Thank you for choosing us
Thank you for joining us
Tom left without telling us
Pray for all of us
They look like us
Tom walked back upstairs
Tom is going to be very upset
Tom still looks upset
Tom said you were upset
I was a little upset
Keep us updated
This is where I grew up
This ought to cheer you up
You need to shut up
Tom looks like he just got up
Go ahead and open it up
I just made that up
Maybe you should just give up
Maybe we should just give up
I woke up
I can barely stand up
The results were unpredictable
Tom wanted to unpack
I believe this was unnecessary
I was very unlucky
Tom was really unlucky
I was really unlucky
They were really unlucky
This cat is unlucky
We all sang in unison
This house is uninhabitable
I feel very unhappy
Tom still looks unhappy
The result was unexpected
I thought Tom was unemployed
I thought they were unemployed
I thought you were unemployed
I think you understand
Not everyone will understand
Tom still felt uncomfortable
I think Tom has your umbrella
I made two
I wish I had a twin
Tom hates TV
You watch too much TV
I feel like watching TV
We could take turns
It would be worth trying
It might be worth a try
Tom had to tell Mary the truth
We just want the truth
We want the truth
I always tell the truth
Tom should tell the truth
Tom simply told the truth
I hate that trumpet
Tom was playing the trumpet
We hope this is true
The opposite is true
What Tom says is quite true
I had some trouble
It was a very long trip
I feel like taking a trip
I pulled the trigger
This is a beautiful tree
This is my treat
Tom threw it in the trash
I burned the trash
It was like I was in a trance
I went there by train
See you on the train
Tom remained on the train
Tom could take you to town
Tom headed back to town
Let me show you around town
I was on a tour
Next year will be tough
Think about it tonight
Expect a surprise tonight
Tom is on duty here tonight
This box weighs a ton
I can call you tomorrow
I need you tomorrow
I need that tomorrow
Our wedding is tomorrow
I need your answer tomorrow
Tom will have to work tomorrow
Tom will be arriving tomorrow
I start working tomorrow
Explain it to me tomorrow
I might be dead tomorrow
I was fool enough to marry Tom
I felt lost without Tom
I still think about Tom
Stop talking about Tom
No one will ever forget Tom
The problem is Tom
Do what you can for Tom
It was too much for Tom
I still remember Tom
There was no one to stop Tom
I think you should help Tom
I think we should help Tom
I pointed this out to Tom
I have to say goodnight to Tom
This book belongs to Tom
I advise you to listen to Tom
Tell the truth to Tom
Just apologize to Tom
You need to apologize to Tom
It seemed like a game to Tom
I guess you talked to Tom
I heard you talked to Tom
I knew we could count on Tom
Maybe you should call Tom
I suppose I can ask Tom
I suppose I could ask Tom
I spent Monday with Tom
I discussed it with Tom
I shook hands with Tom
I share everything with Tom
We should be there with Tom
I watched a movie with Tom
I almost agree with Tom
I spent the weekend with Tom
We should be there helping Tom
That reminds me of Tom
It reminds me of Tom
This reminds me of Tom
I really love Tom
Tell me what you gave Tom
I did surprise Tom
Try to ignore Tom
I was on my way to see Tom
I would like to see Tom
I was very glad to see Tom
I wanted to be Tom
Be careful not to offend Tom
I really loved Tom
I just missed Tom
I just fired Tom
Someone has warned Tom
Remember to flush the toilet
We wrote the report together
They both left together
We could learn together
Try to work together
I thought you were together
We cried together
I have to do my laundry today
Tom had to go home early today
I have to do it today
I wish it was today
Thank you very much for today
I bought a new guitar today
I have to work today
Tom just got back today
I broke a vase today
I started working here today
Tom left his car at home today
I feel romantic today
You may kiss me if you want to
Let me get you a tissue
I was already tired
I never got tired
Now I feel tired
I think you look tired
I think you must be tired
Tom is going to be tired
I read the story three times
The only problem is time
Things change over time
Maybe we can make it on time
I barely made it on time
The plane took off on time
Tom may not be here on time
Tom stayed there a long time
Tom has lived here a long time
You still have time
What I need is more time
They lie all the time
Now is really not a good time
Now would be a good time
Hold me tighter
This coat is too tight
You forgot to put on your tie
I have two tickets
That sounds like a threat
I want you to try this
Maybe we can fix this
We were talking about this
Come and have a look at this
I know a faster way to do this
Tell me why I have to do this
It takes patience to do this
I think we can do this
I hope I can do this
I miss all this
Tom is aware of all this
Let me just finish this
Give me time to finish this
You can accomplish this
I have to stop doing this
I hope you like this
It always happens like this
Maybe I should take this
I also found this
I recommend this
I really needed this
We needed this
I knew Tom would be thirsty
I was thinking
I know what you were thinking
I wanted some time to think
It made me think
I saw many things
Now I understand many things
I already have my things
I have my things
I had the wrong things
I hate those things
I want the real thing
You always say the same thing
I always do the same thing
It could be a good thing
The police arrested the thief
Tom sent me these
I made these
Tom is probably already there
Throw it there
Just leave that there
My office is over there
Sit down over there
The stairs are over there
My kids used to go there
I decided to go there
I left everything there
We were there
All of us plan to be there
I hope to be there
Tom asked me to be there
Everyone will be there
Tom could still be there
I should be there
Tom will need physical therapy
Tom is a speech therapist
Tom was waiting for Mary then
Tom may be back by then
Things were different then
We were all so young then
A lot has changed since then
Keep your apples
This is what scares them
I feel sorry for them
I have confidence in them
Ask them
There were lots of them
There were three of them
There are three of them
Let us go and see them
Everyone gathered around them
I never trusted them
Tom has been accused of theft
We went to the theater
I would enjoy that
All my friends say that
I was just about to say that
Tom had no right to say that
Tom used to say that
We already knew that
I already knew that
Let me worry about that
I also have doubts about that
I told Tom about that
We know all about that
Let me think about that
Stop talking about that
I read about that
Thank you for telling us that
Thanks for telling us that
Tom always does that
Nobody blames you for that
I love you for that
I want to remember that
We need to remember that
It may not come to that
You would never do that
It was my duty to do that
I forgot to do that
I know several ways to do that
Nobody forced Tom to do that
I refuse to do that
I intend to do that
I had to do that
I can still do that
I believe Tom did mean that
I had trouble doing that
I regretted doing that
Let me take care of that
I guess I could use that
Tom sent me that
Thanks for telling me that
It was Tom who gave me that
I was just like that
I used to like that
Maybe we can change that
Nothing will change that
I already sold that
It was Tom who did that
Maybe I just imagined that
I really needed that
I never noticed that
It was a tough test
I hate terrorism
Tom was tense
I always enjoy playing tennis
I work in telecommunications
I just brushed my teeth
Now go brush your teeth
Tom is on our team
I have fun teaching
I like teaching
My parents were teachers
Tom has good teachers
That could be my teacher
I had a great teacher
I trust the teacher
I have a good teacher
I love to teach
Tom likes herbal tea
Let me get you some tea
Let me make you some tea
We all have to pay taxes
I love that tattoo
You have very good tastes
This is an important task
It was an impossible task
Tom and I sat down to talk
Tom has a lot of talent
I was sympathetic
Tom is teaching me how to swim
Tom bought a sweater
I had my suspicions
I hope I survive
I love surprises
There will be some surprises
I was very surprised
I like to be surprised
It was a pleasant surprise
It was a welcome surprise
This news was a surprise
I had to be sure
You have my support
I love sunflowers
I wanted to sunbathe
I started this job last summer
Someone else took my suitcase
Give me some suggestions
I was very successful
Last year was quite successful
The party was a huge success
I hope to succeed
It takes courage to succeed
We will succeed
I hope I succeed
I need subtitles
I must be completely stupid
My friends are stupid
You must really be stupid
This is serious stuff
I bought some stuff
It was really good stuff
I was studying
I suggest you study
You should continue to study
I feel very strong
My boss is very strict
I have to stretch
I live on Park Street
It sounds strange
It all seems so strange
It may seem strange
It seemed strange
It was a really creepy story
Tom himself told me this story
Tom told me a strange story
Tell me your life story
Boston was our first stop
I knew I had to stop
Perhaps you should stop
My thermos was stolen
My car was stolen
My journal was stolen
My microscope was stolen
My car has been stolen
Try to stand still
My hands are sticky
Watch where you step
This is the right station
We need to start
This is a good start
We got off to a bad start
Your shirt is stained
Tom walked off the stage
That was money well spent
It was spectacular
Tom is good at public speaking
Thanks for letting me speak
I really liked the soup
Tom should be here pretty soon
I hope to return soon
The show will begin soon
We hope to reopen soon
I hope to finish soon
You should come soon
Tom is likely to die soon
Tom is a good songwriter
Tom says he can write songs
This is my favorite song
Tom should write a song
Tom is the name of my son
It still happens sometimes
We go out together sometimes
I get homesick sometimes
You have to buy something
Please let me say something
Tom always wants something

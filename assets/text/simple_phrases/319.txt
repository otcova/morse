Mt
Alice is her sister

Mary will do it for him
Your suitcase looks very heavy
Your performance was very good
Your designs are very original
Your arm needs to be amputated
You sure were noisy last night
You should start getting ready
You should go outside and play
You should consider doing that
You should admit your mistakes
You seemed to enjoy doing that
You really should visit Boston
You promised to do that for us
You offered to help us do that
You need to think for yourself
You need to do that more often
You must not come here anymore
You must be tempted to do that
You may take any book you like
You look like your grandfather
You look like you have an idea
You look a little better today
You left your office door open
You have to do that right away
You have to do that more often
You had every right to do that
You definitely need to do that
You could do that if you tried
You can swim better than I can
You can do that if you want to
You apparently need to do that
You apparently have to do that
Women and girls should do that
We were busy all day yesterday
We seldom go to Boston anymore
We sat down and started eating
We often see foxes around here
We live in different countries
We did that a couple weeks ago
This is where I found your key
This is a very comfortable bed
These jeans are too big for me
There are more of them than us
The window in my room is dirty
The concert is about the begin
That would be impossible to do
Tell me why you went to Boston
Please let me buy that for you
Our troubles are far from over
Our train was three hours late
Our problems are far from over
My plan is to do that tomorrow
My mother told me to come home
My mother has gotten remarried
My lawyer told me it was legal
My last day of work was Monday
My job description has changed
My house needs to be repainted
My friends did that without me
My father told me an old story
My family seldom eats together
My family owns this restaurant
My dog was run over by a truck
My contract is for three years
My children are already asleep
My business is doing very well
My bedroom only has one window
My barn burned down last night
More research needs to be done
It would be logical to do that
It would be fun to do that now
It would be foolish to do that
It was very hot inside the bus
It was very foolish to do that
It was a lot of fun doing that
It should be OK to do that now
It makes good sense to do that
My daughter drew me a picture
I worked on a farm last summer
I wonder why I need to do that
I wish you knew how to do that
I wish to speak to the manager
I wish I had been more careful
I went for a walk on the beach
I was too tired to do anything
I was the first one to do that
I was just in Boston last week
I was hoping you could do that
I was asked to speak in French
I wanted both of them to leave

No
Give me a spoon
Her name is Mary
Please go on ahead
Please go ahead without me

I want a future
Joy will not last forever
Catalonia is not Spain
Nobody knows where she is
Nobody knew where she was
Everything Tom did bothered me
Tom was late as usual
That just might happen
Tom always wears black clothes
Tom was standing in line
Tom smiled and said goodbye
That cost a lot
He whistles all the time
It drives me crazy
My mother is a crazy woman
I have to go upstairs
I was bitten by a mosquito
To love is to suffer
Trains run on rails
He wanted help
I also got it
Tom is mad at everyone
Tom is still in his pajamas
Tom leaned on his cane
Tom lost his key
I want his help
To keep you is no benefit
To destroy you is no loss
It was an object of terror
Volcanoes spouted ash and lava
Alex is genderqueer
Tom brought that
Life is our greatest wealth
She sleeps in the car
I speak German well
She borrowed my scissors
Try to prioritise these things
Cook the soup in the house
Let Tom send the letter
Everyone lies to me
I am crazy over you
Everyone knows you

I wonder why Tom said that
Some meat remained
None of the food was left
There was some meat left over
Tom fell from his crutches
I love beef
I will not tolerate critiques
They gave away the ending
The flower pot is broken
Love is hard to define
This is called shorthand
The road was icy
I heard nothing about that
Tom is working on it right now
Tom should move to Boston
Tom rarely goes to Boston
Tom died while in Boston
Tom grew up near Boston
It was a very dark night

Either way works for me
The service here is awful
You are taller than her
Everything has got its time
He is not on Facebook
Tom has quit using Facebook
Tom and I are Facebook friends
We are not ready
This armchair is comfortable
The frying pan is rusty
More people should do that
We should do that again
You should do that

No DNA evidence was found
I think Tom will enjoy this
Maybe you should quit drinking
Tom gave me one crore rupees
Tom gave me one lakh rupees
Let me know if you need more
Please add a new sentence

The initiative is punishable
It was almost too easy
Tom drank curdled milk
You can open the window
My father was an actor
My mother is making dinner
Tom has a beloved wife
Her name is Mary

We were diving
I never run away
Marko has a dog
His dog is very small
This is quite unequivocal

He cried out from pain
As usual he brought me nothing
She will let it go this time
She will drop it this time
You will let it go this time
You will drop it this time
I happen to know him
It so happens that I know him
My watch is not working right
My watch is off
I saw exactly that
He has all the luck
He gets all the breaks
Men are crazy about her
He lowered the curtain
She is an adorable woman
He asked me to keep the secret
I paid him last week
They are not angry

Tom is a very determined man
This road is terrible
I eat pears
My mother is a fantastic woman

Sometimes less is more
I made a rough calculation
The cloud was pitch black
A lot of people live in Tokyo
I was on the verge of tears
Do whatever you want
This is obviously fake
I need to talk to her alone
He just kissed me
Nothing really happened
Most wool comes from sheep
The shearer sheared the sheep
Nice place you have here
Tom went to Pune

You guys are untrustworthy
I wish I could play guitar
She dances well
She is the cutest girl
You cannot complain
I gave him a couple of books
I gave her a couple of books
Tom and Mary got divorced
Everything is connected
I like it when you sing
It was an embarrassing fiasco
I hope he gets punished
Come on
Have a drink
Beware the ides of March
This looks like a good spot
Music brightens our lives
I am engaged to him
I shave my beard every morning
I wish Tom would arrive soon
Right there in that tree
I think that can be arranged
Tom was completely exhausted
Hello
Long time no see
Nobody stood up
The earth is blue
Like an orange
We often eat together
Tom quickly went in the room
The train stopped for a moment
My father has been to space
That cat is quite fat
I want to hear a story
I already know them all
I had my reasons
I want to hear the whole story

We paid him four dollars
He broke relations with them
He collects silk ties
She paid him four dollars
He paid him four dollars
You paid him four dollars
I would want to eat breakfast
Tom is a bit bigger than you
You have beautiful legs
I yearn for the university
We are still doing well
Mama had a crippled face
I got it practically for free
Squirrels love climbing trees
The smell was detestable
Tom may have been here
You smell awful
You smell terrible
You stink
You should take up golf
You should look into that
You should be a diplomat
He wants no kind of flowers
Courage is very important
Second best is never enough
Old dogs can learn new tricks
Doing the laundry is my job
I spread cheese on bread

Likewise
Forget her
Donate blood
Could be
She died of natural causes
We await thee
We await you
The children need you
I am drinking his beer
A child needs a mother
It could always be worse
Ever tried
Ever failed
No matter
Try again
Fail again
Fail better
I never conceal with you
May Heaven pity us
I have been thinking about you
Tom is a compulsive cleaner
I need to get cracking
Mary was devastated

Tom should know what to do
Tom should know this already
Tom should know that already
Tom should go with Mary
Tom should go to prison
Tom should get the job
Tom should get a bonus
Tom should be left alone
Tom often comes to see me
Tom died in the crash
Tom created this
This was created by Tom
This should surprise no one
The ballots are being counted
That should tell us something
Someone should look into this
People are counting on us
No one should be surprised
Maybe we should try harder
Maybe we should switch jobs
Maybe we should get started
It should be fairly obvious
I wish I had said that
I was a creative kid
I think Tom should be fired
I hurt my shoulder
Countless lives have been lost
Count me in on this
Now this is really creepy
Everyone here creeps me out
This place is downright creepy
That never crossed my mind
That thought crossed my mind
We kept our fingers crossed

This is a terrible deal
This car handles curves well
There will be other deals
There was no structural damage
There was no reported damage
There was no damage reported
The debate has been postponed
The courts will decide that
That meant a great deal to me
Thanks for defending my honor
Thank you for your dedication
No vital organs were damaged
Let Tom decide for himself
It was a reasonable deal
It was a great debate
It looks like Tom might cry
I will not be defeated
I just sat there and cried
I have to defend myself
I cried my eyes out
I can deal with anything
Everyone started crying again
His ideas are rarely practical
Her ideas are rarely practical
He fulfilled his obligation

Every day is a new day
This game is very entertaining
This game is very fun

Too bitter
Be careful on these curves

Take a sip
It seems like bubble gum
We have to go around again
Take this exit
We had a pleasant time
She is suing us
I found a long hair
Cat hair everywhere
Sheesh
I wish I had come here sooner
Tom leaned over the railing
Tom leaned against the railing
Tom is a brilliant programmer
Mary is a brilliant programmer
Mary hesitated for a moment
They took their time
Tom sat up slowly
I never flirted with him
You like him and he likes you
You like her and she likes you
It was an accident
I wish it was that easy
Have mercy
Just add water
I never thought it would heal
Grass is for cows
Love everyone
The punchline comes at the end
I want to become faster
Get on my karma train
It was a novel in one sentence
I almost died of thirst
He was a strange fellow
She told me that he loved me
The passenger next to me
I used his remote
It was so loud
And that
And this
Translate this short sentence
It was easy for them
You were chosen at random
Fasten your seatbelts
Hmm
I know a word
He moved to LA
He died his hair pink
San Diego is a punk ass bitch

Not sure yet
She has a cough
Food arrived
It was so cold today
I miss you more
Yes and super exhausted
Raining hard
Her name is Tabetha

If completed
One question
This plant needs fertilizer
Her name is Fertilizia
Tom pounded the table
You broke the Internet
I protest
He phoned
I am also one of them
Tom rolled onto his back
He will eat
Your sister is competitive
They kicked me off the plane
She left the planet
Check your voicemail
Tom asked me to invite you
Mary asked me to invite you
I felt really stupid
This is one thing I know
This time for certain
I caught an eel in my net
All of our matches are wet
They are desperate
It was his time
Knock on wood
Happy hunting
She needs a new liver
Heavy load ahead
No fat chicks
Fat chicks welcome
I like plump women
I love her more than anything
One point
Chickpeas for the win
What a stupid bitch
America at its finest
Pass the dressing
Pause
Take a deep breath
Count to Mississippi
Take a jump shot
Set your phasers on stun
I scream
We scream
We all scream for ice cream
Step one
Get fur hat
Step two
Learn drums
Step three
Get facelift
LOL
Listen to the bands near you
You cast a big shadow
I wish I was in a band
So peaceful
I called out
I called your name
I get this band
I hope for a soft landing
I bought a juicer
This tastes like crap
Liquor not included
Some assembly required
Curtain call
We spend every moment together

Participation is mandatory
Fade into grey
I made my own potato chips
I need carbs from time to time
The beat goes on

Her leg is in a cast
Put on sunscreen
I got bit
He only left me a few morsels
Clean your plate
Eat your broccoli
A haircut will cheer me up
Time for lunch
Get up on your tippy toes
I broke my big toe
I stubbed my toe
I suppose not
Slide on over
Make room for me
Text me your shopping list
She put the kibosh on that
Our cat loves cheese
Our car is in the shop
Tom to the rescue
Butter makes my knees sore
Butter inflames my arthritis
Wow
I like Fred and Ethel
More so Fred
She was saving it
We need people like you
Looks like a tackle box
Everything is tangled
It popped off
Tom must get some fresh air
My knee is sore
My knee aches
I feel bloated
My vision is blurry
I have other symptoms
I need a bag to throw up in
I dreamt that I got worms
The dog has worms
The station is closed
The last train just left
She cut your sides short
Bundle up
The cat is at the window
Let the cat in
Let the dog in
You can pet the dog
Let the cat out
Just checking in
Just seeing what you are up to
This better be important
The jack of diamonds
The inside of my house is cold
Remember to take your medicine
Humans are aggressive animals
Shhh
Your glasses are broken
The doctor is corrupt

Help clean up
Dress the wound
The finger is broken
We need to airlift her
The helicopter is landing
There are lights underwater
Turn on the spotlight
They found a body
The drummer died
The drummer drowned
The drummer overdosed
The car door does not work
He needs spiritual help
He has a good character
He lived dangerously
He was reckless
Be careful with the doses
Here comes hypothermia
Her eyes are dilated
One eye is dilated
The entree is cold
Have some vodka straight
No one was hurt in the robbery
People are spiritually hungry
I collect action figures
My cat was sprayed by a skunk
The drummer is missing
Promise me
Hold the leash
The disease took his sight
I caught a fish
This puppy found me

There is more at stake
She is fixable
It snowballed
Good luck is contagious
Give me a taste
All day long
The computer is rebooting
Please update the computer
Watch out for falling coconuts
I want this and this
I want this and that
Begin every meal with soup
Tadpoles are fun to watch

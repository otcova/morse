This is so surreal
This is our moment
This is our legacy
Tom is watching you
This is my opinion
This is like magic
Tom is very complex
This is killing me
This is everything
Tom is very chipper
This is an extract
This is an anomaly
Tom is tired of you
This is all stupid
This is a computer
Tom is still nimble
This feels amazing
This could get bad
This could be huge
Things come and go
Tom is on the radio
Tom is now deceased
Tom is no gentleman
They were so heavy
They never said no
Tom is no exception
They make me laugh
They have declined
Tom is no economist
They can all shoot
They beat us badly
Tom is no different
They approached us
They all did great
Tom is in the wrong
There are traitors
Their logic was OK
Tom is hard to beat
The wait continues
The tent collapsed
Tom is good company
The search is over
The room got quiet
Tom is eating bread
The pressure is on
The meat was burnt
The match was over
The latrine stinks
Tom is always great
The gap has closed
The feud continues
Tom is a mere child
The birds took off
Tom is a lost cause
Tom is a lieutenant
Tom is a fishmonger
Tom is a competitor
Tom himself said so
Tom helped the kids
That will never do
Tom has some advice
That song is corny
That risk paid off
He lost a watch
Tom should have known this
Some woman called you
I no longer believe anyone
She has a proportionate figure
I have fished an eel
Tom has our support
That may sound odd
That kind of sucks
Tom has no backbone
Thanks for nothing
Tom has his critics
Thank God for that
Tell us your story
Tom has gone cuckoo
Stick to your guns
State your reasons
Tom has few friends
Start your engines
Share your opinion
Tom has earned this
School was my life
Please tell me why
Tom has admitted it
Pets are wonderful
People kill people
Tom has a following
Only time can tell
Oil prices plunged
Tom had seen enough
Nothing came of it
None of them spoke
Tom had fun with it
No deal was struck
My roots are there
Tom got lunch ready
My goals are lofty
My brother uses it
Tom got ahead of me
Money is no object
Look who I married
Tom does a good job
Long live the king
Live while you can
Tom does a fine job
Life is so strange
Life is a delusion
Tom died tragically
Let the show begin
Let me repeat this
Let me repeat that
Tom comes on strong
Let me just finish
Let me do this one
Tom chased after me
Legal help is here
Keep going forward
Tom can change that
Just think of that
Tom brought us home
Tom blocks the ball
Tom belongs with us
Tom became very ill
Tom beats people up
Tom beat those odds
This is hard on Tom
It was worse today
It was turned down
They agree with Tom
It was too intense
It was too extreme
It was superficial
It was so terrific
It was so terrible
It was so mystical
I would go with Tom
It was so horrible
It was so fabulous
I think Tom is gone
It was rough today
It was pretty loud
I know Tom was here
It was pretty gory
It was poor timing
I fully support Tom
It was just stupid
It was just nerves
I asked Tom a favor
It was astonishing
It was all a farce
It was a good call
It must be a dream
It may not be over
It makes you tough
It makes you proud
It makes us better
It makes it easier
It looks promising
It looked hopeless
It kept me engaged
We hardly know Tom
It has all stopped
Tom won everything
It has affected us
It feels real good
Tom will take over
It feels like home
It ended just fine
Tom will bat third
It could get tense
It could be deadly
It could be better
It changed nothing
Tom was very proud
It can be improved
It breaks my heart
Tom was thrown out
It boggles my mind
Tom was pushing me
Tom was just great
Tom was gone a lot
Tom was all smiles
Tom was a crusader
Tom stole the show
Tom smoked a cigar
Tom slowed the car
Tom runs a charity
Tom proved himself
Tom prepared lunch
Tom pays his taxes
Tom paid Mary cash
Tom messed up huge
Tom made Mary jump
Tom loves his golf
Tom loved to dance
I wish I was there
Tom loved the work
I was younger then
Tom loved his kids
I was taking notes
I was so surprised
Tom looked awesome
I was so impressed
I was so fortunate
Tom likes it there
I was sad at first
I was proved wrong
Tom liked to laugh
I was kind of lost
I was in disbelief
Tom led by example
I was in bad shape
I want to be clear
Tom knows the cost
I tend to doubt it
I smell corruption
Tom knows business
I share everything
I ran out of water
Tom kissed my neck
I promise you that
I never sleep well
Tom just messed up
I never changed it
I need my paycheck
I missed something
I loved every bite
I love this device
I love red parrots
I love our chances
I like to keep fit
I like this season
I like our chances
Tom is well rested
I knew it was time
I just kept silent
Tom is unrealistic
I hit a curve ball
I have to go first
Tom is still tough
I have to do taxes
I have to add this
Tom is staying put
I have the jitters
I hate most people
Tom is smoking hot
I had zero control
Tom is good enough
I get your message
I felt so violated
Tom is apt to fail
I felt so betrayed
I feel so uplifted
Tom is an explorer
I feel so confused
I dream about bugs
Tom is an evil man
Tom is an agnostic
Tom is always good
I do have concerns
Tom is always cool
Tom is almost here
I did it on a lark
I depend on nobody
Tom is a small man
I could name names
Tom is a screwball
I can admit it now
Tom is a daredevil
I bet you get cold
I believe in peace
Tom is a class act
I became a recluse
I admitted as much
Tom is a brave lad
Tom is a born poet
Tom hired a driver
Tom has worked out
Have some patience
Tom has my respect
God bless you guys
Go build something
Tom has been tough
Enjoy your new car
Dressing up is fun
Tom had nice stuff
Tom had had enough
Do what feels good
Tom had a bad time
Cut back on sweets
Tom got tired soon
Tom froze to death
Tom drove me crazy
You have to adapt
You can keep them

Tom could do worse
Tom could be armed
Tom chose to fight
Tom changed it all
Tom caught a thief
Wear a blue dress
Tom caught a shark
Tom carried a cane
Tom can protect me
Tom broke the lamp
We spent too much
We slugged it out
Tom broke his word
We ship worldwide
We saw that today
Tom also showed up
We parted friends
We need new blood
We need a bailout
We must celebrate
Please support Tom
We knew that much
We just proved it
People call me Tom
We had a huge win
We got to talking
We get along fine
I should visit Tom
We follow the law
We drove them out
We can stay quiet
We are very close
We all think that
We all read books
We all love lists
We all grow wiser
Warn your friends
We prayed for Tom
This really works
Things went wrong
We do support Tom
The time is right
Tom would approve
The secret is out
The road is clear
Tom went for help
The risk paid off
The rest is gravy
The moon was full
The money is good

The good guys won
The game was over
Tom was so scared
The end is coming
The cost was huge
Tom was so polite
The cars sped off
Tom was so loving
That was too late
Tom was so hungry
That sounds juicy
That song was fun
Tom was petrified
That makes my day
That helps us out
That gives me joy
Tell me something
Tom was behind me
Stay on your toes
Tom was a witness
Shut up and drive
Show us the proof

It seems that way
It ruined my life

I cried over that
I rather like Tom
I beg you to stay
I assumed as much
I love Tom anyway

I know Tom loves living here
That should be enough for now
He went to the doctor
The woman was going home
Everything is ashes
She walked with someone
She walked with somebody
He walked with someone
He walked with somebody
Let me read your palm
Your shoulders are very tense
Your muscles are very tense
My shoulders are stiff
My back is stiff
My legs are numb

The moon is beautiful
We played chess every morning
We need to take a short break
I have sisters
I have no brothers
I have posted a translation

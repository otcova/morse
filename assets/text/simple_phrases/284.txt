The paper is under the table
My husband likes to sleep
They coughed

Now I live with my uncle
Fuck me
Then suddenly he sneezed
I am an atheist
Markku is a really good friend
Old friends contacted me
She bought three new picks
The porridge was burnt
Their son has autism
You may not smoke here
Tom is a man with many talents
This is our decision
He cracked nuts
I have received a respite
I have gotten a respite
I kissed him on the cheek
She loves trains
I just read a book
I got up earlier to see you
I gave him a kiss on the cheek
I rarely see him
There is a bathroom here
That is disgusting
I agree
I hope it helps
The books are covered in dust
I wonder who bought the cake
The earth is a tomb
The flesh smells horrible
My tooth is killing me
That really is bad
It was a horrible headache
The meat smells terrible
I have known Tom all my life
Maria teaches me Norwegian
Stop that right now
Learning is an endless path
Freedom is a state of mind
I am much younger than Tom

Tom is a lot younger than Mary
Suddenly he spotted me
Suddenly he noticed me
They look cute together
They argue quite often
Bob is a cool guy
Stay calm and keep going
Stay cool and keep going
The soap is finished
You will be a good diplomat
This movie is so boring
Please choose your character
Please pick your character
I hope that my mother is well
I had something else planned
Go outside and play now
This is my room
This is my room
I felt sorry for this poor dog
I wish you would do that now
I just wanted to get married
Tom was in a bad mood
Tom smiled to himself
This looks like a great place
This is a luxury
This car cost me a fortune
This book cost me a fortune
He is everything to her
The man is eating
The woman is eating
The child is eating
Go to my place later
I was thirteen years old then
I hope Tom will understand me
I believe that we can do this
I want you to call home now
I need to leave for a while
I ate a slice of watermelon
I think it was an accident
I prefer to study at night
I love pistachio ice cream
I prefer to work at night
I would love to do that
I know Tom will love it
I need to work on that
I need to get out more
I love you all so much
I love the competition
I live by my own rules
I know what you can do
I know this to be true
I know that for a fact
I know it now for sure
I just wanted to do it
I just had a big lunch
I hope to see it again
I hope to see Tom soon
I have a very nice car
I find this ridiculous
I find this disgusting
I find that suspicious
I felt I had no choice
I doubt it can be done
I was very encouraged
I was hit on the head
I want to see Tom cry
I want to have it all
I want to be the boss
I want Tom to go away
I want Tom to be safe
I want Tom to suffer
I want some privacy
I have a green car
I love to bargain
I have a pink car
I want the same
I get emotional
I recommend it
The body needs food and drink
The white umbrella is yours
Tom wept in silence
I loved the old man
The officers were satisfied
My manner had convinced them
About fifteen people showed up
The policeman is in the car
He works well
Thanks for the advice
I see him very rarely
Look at that photograph
Tomorrow I have to go shopping
I take a nap almost every day
She went to get her hair cut
Let us help you do that
Let us know how it goes
Let us know how it went
Let us take care of you
Let us know what happens
Let us take care of this
Let us know what you hear
Let us know where you are
Let us know by next Monday
Let us know if you see Tom
Let us know what you think
Let us help you deal with it
Fall is late this year
The rain made me late
I have to buy some new shoes
It is a beautiful language
He is also a new student
He is from Egypt
She is from Japan
Tom will be back soon
His sister resides in Scotland
Here are the tickets
Snow overtook the rain
The cat is in the house
She does not have many friends
You are going to be eaten
Sharpen these knives
Grass grew
Bucharest is not Budapest
Budapest is not Bucharest
I like the way you smell
Excuse me
I need to go
That amazes me
Admit that you made a mistake
I suffered sunstroke
The toilet is stopped up
Sleep is the best meditation
Night is for sleeping
I regret not marrying her
Now I understand everything
Chew with your mouth closed
Let me take your suitcase
Let me explain the rules
Let them talk
You almost forgot your money
Tom asked me to do it for him
I can hide anywhere
I see a small ship
He is available now
I like to play music with Tom
I had no idea Tom knew French
I know both Tom and his wife
I had no idea Tom would quit
I asked Tom if Mary was OK
I think Tom can help Mary
I did think Tom might win
I wonder if Tom can come
I already gave it to Tom
I wanted to ask Tom why
I wanted Tom to help me
I told Tom to ignore it
I think Tom needs to go
I think Tom may be dead
I think Tom is a coward
I needed Tom to do that
I know Tom and his wife
I hate to see Tom leave
I do feel sorry for Tom
I accompanied Tom there
I told Tom to go ahead
I told Tom I loved him
I think I can help Tom
I gave Tom my car keys
We speak
The human life is a journey
They know the difficulties
I must do that
I knew where to go
I just hope I get paid
I just needed a change
I take care of my body
I think we can make it
I told you not to sing
I try to do what I can
I wanted your feedback
I was hardly surprised
I was lying on my back
I was the last to know
I was there a year ago
I was wrong to do that
Her ashes are interred here
Absolutely impossible
I lay on my back
His car was three metres long
The devout pray in silence
I went for a long walk
I would love to see it
I do travel quite a bit
I got in a car accident
I got really sick of it
I have a long way to go
I have a lot of regrets
I have a wife and a kid
I hope you can see that
I hope you get one soon
I just decided to do it
I just like to have fun
I just need to sit down
I kind of lost my focus
I knew I was in trouble
I knew what I had to do
I know which one I want
I miss my dad every day
I must go to the office
I need to get more food
I need you to stop that
I never get tired of it
I plan on doing my part
I really enjoy it a lot
I really like what I do
I really love what I do
I really must go to bed
I slept on a park bench
I think I can do better
I think I did all right
I think the job is done
I think we got it fixed
I think we were lied to
I told you it was funny
I wanted to be a lawyer
I wanted to be the best
I was absolutely amazed
I was so happy that day
I watch a lot of movies
I watch lots of movies
I went ahead and did it
I went for a short walk
The dog easily killed the cat
One learns by teaching
I learn by reading books
You ruined all my plans
We ran for seven miles
The toothpaste is on the sink
I had gray hair
I agree with both of you
I agree with most of you
I ask a lot of questions
I attend a lot of events
I can see nothing at all
I encourage you to do so
I enjoyed it for a while
I feel like a little kid
I feel lucky to be alive
I had no idea who he was
I have a better idea now
I have a lot of patience
I have a very small nose
I have no one to save me
I have to deal with that
I sure hope you can come
I have a lot of patients
We have a search warrant

Hurry up
You are in the way
You lack confidence
He died in that big fire
I am going to the mall
At least I can see you

We had a nice weekend
Show me your ID card

That really made a difference
We asked Tom about that

Tom had more work to do
This was a hard job to get
There are several reasons
No appointment is needed
Tom said Mary was safe

We knew Tom would win
Tom majored in French
It makes me feel good
I put Tom on the list
I remember that night
Tom owns this place
Tom is a bright guy
Maybe Tom will help

Even Tom lied to us
Tom had work to do
I think that Tom should stay
I think Tom would be pleased
I think Tom played very well
I think Tom just needs a hug
I really hope Tom comes back

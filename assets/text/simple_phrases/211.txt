Tom ate a hamburger for lunch
Tom asked the wrong questions
Tom asked me to tell you that
Tom asked me to meet him here
Tom asked me to give you this
Tom asked Mary to forgive him
Tom asked Mary to cook dinner
Tom asked Mary for assistance
Tom appears unwilling to help
Tom appears to be quite upset
Tom appears to be disoriented
Tom announced he was retiring
Tom and Mary both looked busy
Tom and Mary are best friends
They wrote that song together
There seems to be no one here
The sun has already gone down
The party started an hour ago
Roses are my favorite flowers
Please take me to the station
None of the windows were open
Mary went to the beauty salon
Let me give you some pointers
It snowed for three more days
I wrote this three months ago
I wonder why Tom was so angry
I wonder who brought the cake
I wonder where this road goes
I wonder where that came from
I wonder what Tom plans to do
I wonder what Tom is thinking
I wonder what Tom is planning
I wonder if you could help us
I wonder if you can assist me
I wonder if this really works
I wonder if maybe I should go
I wonder if I should warn Tom
I wonder if I can do it again
I wonder how Tom is taking it
I wish Tom were more like you
I wish to see Tom immediately
I wish there were another way
I wish the pain would go away
I wish I were there right now
I wish I knew how to help you
I wish I knew how this worked
I was wondering what that was
I was with Tom this afternoon
I was under a lot of pressure
I was trying to tell Tom that
I was trying to get some help
I was thinking the same thing
I was thinking of getting one
I was the last one to see Tom
I was tempted to call in sick
I was sure we could trust Tom
I was starting to get worried
I was sorry to hear about Tom
I was only kidding about that
I was only gone a few minutes
I was on the road last summer
I was looking forward to this
I was just trying to remember
I was just trying to be funny
I was just thinking about Tom
I was just stretching my legs
I was just doing some reading
I was hoping to hear from you
I was hoping to find you here
I was having trouble sleeping
I was going to visit a friend
I was going to tell the truth
I was going to do that anyway
I was going to call Tom today
I was as surprised as anybody
I warned you not to trust Tom
I want to leave this box here
I want to know where you live
I want to check something out
I want nothing to do with Tom
I used to want more than this
I used to live near the ocean
I understand how hard this is
I trust Tom as much as anyone
I tried to get Tom to help us
I tried not to think about it
I tried not to make any noise
I took a long nap after lunch
I told you to get out of here
I told you not to talk to Tom
I told Tom you went home sick
I told Tom to wait over there
I told Tom to wait in the car
I told Tom not to tell anyone
I told Tom exactly what I saw
I told Tom and Mary about you
I told Tom about it yesterday
I thought you were on my side
I thought you were a Canadian
I thought you understood that
I thought you needed the rest
I thought you might be hungry
I thought you loved chocolate
I thought you liked everybody
I thought you came to see Tom
I thought Tom should tell you
I thought this was a hospital
I thought that was impossible
I thought it was pretty scary
I thought I put it in the car
I thought I heard you come in
I suppose you want to go home
I suppose you want to eat now
I saw Tom with a group of men
I remember where we first met
I know that Mary is beautiful
I hope I can keep up with you
I have no one else to talk to
I had no idea you worked here
I bought a pair of sunglasses
I always pay the rent on time
Everyone jumped into the pool
Both of them started laughing
Accidents happen all the time
Your reputation precedes you
You worry too much about Tom
You have thirty minutes left
We work at the same hospital
We swim together once a week
We know very little about it
We have all the time we need
Tom yelled at Mary in French
Tom wrote to Mary every week
Tom wrote Mary a long letter
Tom would never kill himself
Tom works for the government
Tom works for an oil company
Tom wondered what that meant
Tom wishes to speak with you
Tom will have to be replaced
Tom will be home by midnight
Tom will be here in a minute
Tom will be down in a minute
Tom will be back in a moment
Tom watched Mary as she left
Tom watched from the doorway
Tom was sitting on the floor
Tom was harboring a fugitive
Tom wanted to make a snowman
Tom wanted to live on a farm
Tom wanted to go for a drive
Tom walked down the sidewalk
Tom walked down the corridor
Tom waited for Mary to leave
Tom waited for Mary to begin
Tom usually gets what he wants
Tom unscrewed the light bulb
Tom turned the light back on
Tom turned on the table lamp
Tom turned on the headlights
Tom turned on his flashlight
Tom told Mary what not to do
Tom told Mary to stop eating
Tom thought that was amusing
Tom started yelling for help
Tom spent three weeks in bed

Tom angrily pushed Mary away
Tom and Mary switched places
Tom and Mary played checkers
Tom and Mary both looked sad
This is the captain speaking
The walls were painted white
Some of us have things to do
Mary has curlers in her hair
I wrote down the information
I would be happy to help you
I would appreciate your help
I worry about that sometimes
I work nights as a paramedic
I work for somebody else now
I wonder why Tom is so happy
I wonder why the bus is late
I wonder whose idea this was
I wonder what Tom will think
I wonder what scared Tom off
I wonder if Tom plays tennis
I wonder if Tom is all right
I won second prize last year
I woke up thirty minutes ago
I wish you could stay longer
I wish you could go with Tom
I wish you could accept that
I wish we could just ask Tom
I wish to be candid with you
I wish things were different
I wish that I could help you
I wish it had been that easy
I wish I were going with you
I wish I could talk about it
I wish I could stay with you
I wish I could come with you
I was visiting Tom in Boston

I was unable to prevent this
I was trying to get it right
I was told you were reliable
I was told Tom would be here
I was looking for the remote
I was just talking about you
I was just talking about Tom
I was just going to call you

All my friends have bicycles
Your room is always so neat
You signed for the delivery
You should find another job
You have very little choice
We take long walks together
We play basketball together
We know everything you know
We have no right to do that
Tom would never hurt anyone

I wonder what became of Tom
I wonder if you can help me
I wonder if Tom can hear us
I wish you had called ahead
I wish Tom were still alive
I wish Tom could see me now

They are strange
I am strange
We are strange
I was talking to the moon
Suck my cock
I want to be inside you
My cock is getting hard
Your skin is so smooth
I spank you
I smirk
I slowly put my lips on yours
I gently put my lips on yours
Change it however you need to
This river is dry
She lives in that village
I recognize that melody
The whole city was under water
Forget that now
There was damp on the walls
Stop being such a misery guts
Mary put the cup on the table
A cat lives in that shop
A cat lives in the shop
Mary is always alone
You sing as well as you dance
I need a table
I need a table
I can draw you if you like
I need some cold water
Everyone else drinks coffee
The cats are keeping them away
I love tabby cats
There was no way to go
Tom called in sick again
Tom has called in sick again
I will study it
We hope that will be enough

Stop being a people pleaser
People pleasers are cowards
Tom must prove it to us
Tom has to prove it to us

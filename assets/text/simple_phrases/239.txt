I found this in our mailbox
I miss Tom a lot
I need Tom in my life

They were forgotten
Depending on others is taboo
His new book was well received
She put an end to her days
My wife is Swedish

Please take this
Please bring a salad
Tom grew up with me
I hear you just got married
Come back inside
We should head home
Tom was devoted
Tom seems bossy
I tried it before
Tom is the boy on the right
Mary is the girl on the left
There was no one on the beach
This is really gross
No one is going to know
You can borrow mine
That place is creepy
He kept looking at you
She kept looking at you
I like muesli
I was just about to go to bed
Tom kept looking at you
Tom is always looking at you
All or nothing

Wait for me here
You asked me to help
You look like a freak

Try to keep calm
All prayers are useless
Marriage changes people
My phone died
My phone is dead
My phone needs recharged
My phone needs to be recharged
He tripped him up
Your record is good
She was stabbed in the back
A month without you is not fun

Everybody knows everybody
He who has bees also has honey
We burn all desire for freedom
She let herself go
This is a hectoliter of wine
That just might work
It might work
Surcharges are not included
Everything is stupid
Sledding is very easy
No one approved the proposal
Say no to hatred and violence
She likes secrets
There is a pen
Life is like a game of chess
Come drink a beer to my health
A drink never hurt anybody
They made the right decision
Tom left work early today
Tom helped me escape
Stop fooling around
Please send me a postcard
Just leave it to me
I helped fix the leak
I heard you lost your job
You pay me very well
It makes me feel alive
That will buy us some time
I know her sister
The manual is in Spanish only
Popcorn
We eat at home
No one else does
Agree to disagree
Cry with someone
He can take it
Say no to racism
The idea is not new

Someone is here to see you
You always pick her side
I wish I was there with you
I am waiting
I swear on my own life
I just saw that I got hacked
Think whatever you want
I would never insult you
It skyrocketed
It takes some courage
Maybe it was not so obvious
Diseases begin to come forward
I am forced to stay at home
I made myself discovered
Shoot yourself with a shotgun
He disposes of them instantly
You look like a little girl
Your liver would like it
It takes awareness

At least you had fun
I like how you reason
It was last year
We put part of it there

I live just up the road
I live next door
I live there by myself
I live three blocks away
I live three doors down
I loaned Tom all my money
My father might be at home now
He laughed until he cried
He is not mad
You never cease to surprise me
This song speaks to me
That song speaks to me
They are all fake
Tom went to the hospital
I am not
I look forward to meeting Tom
I looked all over for Tom
I looked for Tom
I looked in the window
I looked it up on the Internet
I lost everything I had
I lost my dog
I lost my favorite pen
I lost my flashlight
I lost my job on Monday
I lost my phone
I lost my temper
I lost sight of Tom
I lost that argument
I lost the bet
I lost three kilograms
I lost track of the time
I love arguing with Tom
I love beach parties
I love being a teacher
I love break dancing
I love Christmas
I love cooking for my family
I love doing this

I was in time for the train
I made this for you
I made this happen
I caused this
I made Tom a promise
I made Tom cry
I made Tom laugh
I made Tom very angry
I made you a ham sandwich
I made you a surprise
I made you coffee
I made you cookies
I made you lunch
I made you some cupcakes
I made you something
I majored in chemistry
I make a good living
I make a living playing music
I make a lot of money
I make a mean margarita
I make my own decisions
I make my own rules
I make no apologies for that
I make no excuses for that
I make the rules
I really agree with you
I owed him a thousand dollars
I know his brother well
I followed the bus
I felt pity for the boy
Nature is my element
I speak Gibberish best
We will drink to your health
Genetics will never change
Each page is an adventure
I married a Canadian
I may actually have to go
I may be a little rusty
I may be able to answer that
I may be able to find Tom
I may be gone for a while
I may be right
I may do just that
I may get fired for doing this
I may give it another try
I may have a solution
I may have been wrong

I read the novel in three days
He refused to inform them
She went away to Italy
I no longer believe it
I no longer live here
I no longer live in Boston

I only drink to be sociable
I only have one condition

I only have one so far
I only have one suggestion
I only hope Tom likes me
I only know what you tell me
I only met Tom three times
I only need a minute

She crossed the street
I am already old

I own this store
I paid for it already
I paid for the drinks
I paid for them
I paid for these tickets
I paid in advance
I paid to have this done
I parked around back

I persuaded Tom to help me
I picked these flowers myself
I picked Tom up after school
I picked you some flowers
I plan on being early
I plan on winning
I planned a party for Tom
I play a little guitar

I play bass in a jazz band
I prefer to remain seated
I pretended to work
I promise not to sing
I promise not to tell Tom
I promised no such thing
I punched Tom in the face
I put it here somewhere
I put it in your room
I put it on your desk
I put my clothes in the dryer
I question your choices
I question your loyalty
I question your sincerity
I quit a long time ago
I quit after a week
I quit my job
I quit smoking three years ago
I ran ahead to warn everybody
I ran all the way home
I ran into a little trouble
I ran into Tom at lunch today
I ran into Tom the other day
I ran into Tom yesterday
I ran out of the house
I rang the bell
I rang the doorbell
I read a lot of magazines
I read a lot of novels
I read about it in the paper
I read the report you wrote
I read Tom a story
I realized I needed help
I realized what was happening
He has gained weight
Pleased to meet you
Tom was raped by his father
I really am interested
I really appreciate the offer
I really appreciate this
I really did have a great time
I really do appreciate it
I really do hate Tom
I really do have to go
I really do like Christmas

I really think I should drive
I really think we need to talk
I really think we should talk
I really think you should come
I really thought Tom liked me
I really thought Tom was dead
I really thought Tom was happy
That is of no value to us
We went to an Italian pizzeria
I received this fax from Tom
I received your message
I received your note
I recently had surgery
I rechecked the data
I think Tom will be interested
I reckon you should do it
I think you should do it
Thanks for adding me
I pulled a triceps
My glass is empty
It was very hard to say that
I recognized his face
I recognized the name
I recommend it highly
I recommended Tom for the job
I reconsidered your offer
I reconsidered your proposal
I recorded our conversation
I recorded the interview
I refuse to accept it
I refuse to accept that
I refuse to allow it
I refuse to allow this
I refuse to answer that
I refuse to give up on this
I regret doing that
I regret saying that
I regret that decision
I relied on Tom
I remember all that
I remember both of you
I remember hearing about Tom
I remember it now
I remember many things
I remember reading about it
I remember saying that
I remember seeing this before
I remember that feeling
I remember that guy
I remember that speech
I remember the day I met Tom
I remember this music
I remember those days
I remember Tom well
I remember what I saw
I remember when it happened
They blame Tom for everything
We got something for Tom
Everyone smiled at Tom
I am bound to secrecy
Tom never fails
Tom seemed unsuccessful
He hates her
Tom sounds worried
Let Tom stay here
Tom is never here
Tom is probably angry
I tried to guess her age
Happy days go by fast
I know that I know nothing
They dine at seven
I am a realistic person
His work showed so careless
The story seems to be true
The story seems true
The story appears true
See you in two weeks
Today I dreamed I was dead
Write your name in pencil
Tom wants way too much money

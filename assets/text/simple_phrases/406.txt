Tom is a mathematical genius
The transformation is complete
It would have been unbearable
Boeing builds a fine aircraft
Now that will be interesting
They should have intervened
I personally prefer Twitter
CBS should cancel this show
Visits are by appointment only
The new iPads look amazing
The gangsters started firing
Consumer confidence is up
Tom climbs only in the winter
Follow us on Facebook

Something has fallen
I produce music
He returns tomorrow
I travel
Birds fly in flocks
He smoked
I like rock music

I have to go do that today
I plan to go home by bus
Tom admits he left early
That big book is mine
This is beyond perfection
Go on foot
The engine runs smoothly
I told Mary I loved her

Stay away from such trouble
The door of languages unlocked

There is a man and a woman
Sami was going to sue Layla
Sami is being belligerent

Gone fishing
You were spoilt
Only you can persuade Tom
You are right
He is wrong
That bird is called a wagtail
Those are valuable words
I shut my car door
I was mad at her
I want to drink water
I want to eat my lunch
I want to play with you
He wants to leave now
She wants to leave now
This one is my son
This one is my daughter
I like to play
I like joking
I ate my dinner
I am ill today
I will leave tomorrow
I dream of spring every day

I walked on the path
Seek after me
Tell him I love you
Tell them I love it
Bring him back with you

She bought a bottle of water
We bought a bottle of water
They bought a bottle of water
Write a sentence on the board
Tell me when you were born
He drank his morning coffee
The boy woke up early

She sang her country
He knows how to sing
Today it is hot

He found me awake
He found you awake
He found us awake
He found them awake
You found me awake
You found him awake
You found us awake
You found them awake
You drank a cup of coffee
We drank a cup of coffee
She sleeps with him
She sits with him
Follow the trace
Follow your path
Seeking it
Give your opinion
Do not give your opinion
The word has spread
He did not believe his eyes
He has only one word
Thank goodness they are better
I would like to travel abroad
It might rain
Do not open the door
Islam clearly teaches us that
Wish me good luck

He wrote a long poem
Look you find
Does not matter to me
Join him
Do like him
Finish quickly

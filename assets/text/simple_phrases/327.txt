You ought to wait for Tom
We seldom see Tom do that
We both know Tom did that
Three girls sang with Tom
The car Tom bought is red
Your shirt is missing a button
Tell Tom to wait a moment
Your room is cleaner than mine
Perhaps Tom is eating now
Let Tom sleep on my couch
It was Tom who left early
It looks like Tom may win

I know what Tom had to do
We should try doing that again
I knew that Tom would win
We should do that by ourselves
I knew that Tom could win
We seldom do that by ourselves
We need to do that immediately

I had Tom do that for you
Tom was scolded by the teacher
I doubt that Tom will win
This was an expensive painting

I doubt that Tom will cry
This is the place where I work
Tom was able to win eventually
I doubt that Tom can swim
This fish tastes better cooked
Tom wants you to sing with him

Please buy me something to eat
One of the screws has come out
My family and I live in Boston

Tom ought to wait a bit longer
Tom ought to learn how to swim

Tom needs your help to do that
Tom might want to sing with us
I want you not to do that here
Tom may not go fishing with us
I want to stay a little longer
Tom may have agreed to do that
I want to live near my parents
Tom looks reluctant to do that

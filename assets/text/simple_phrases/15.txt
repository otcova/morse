Tom is back at work now
They almost died
My lip popped
We also went
Let me make a guess
Wash the dog
Tom got in touch with us
Nobody bothered me
Tom is a lonely person
We never win
Do what you have to
All talk and no action
The crime rate is going up
This also happens to me
Tom stared at the floor
This movie is exciting
Stop imitating me
Tom is a dispatcher
Give me this
Tom can play the clarinet
Tell me exactly what you want

Only you can fix this

Tom is staying with Mary
Tom wants ice cream
Tom is hoping he can meet Mary
Tom had a cap on
No one in my family smokes
I like getting up early
I really enjoyed the meal
You had better do as I suggest
Your prophecy has come true
Your room is out of order
You have been beaten
The converse is also true
One thing remains doubtful
Disease and famine go together
The barometer is falling
It is going to rain
Study the student more
He did not get any game
The expansion is aging
Each is good in its degree
With kind regards to you all
The sea was running high
The sea is very wide
The sea is down
The sun rose from the sea
It is never too late to mend
There go the twelve bars blues
Fix a date for the meeting
We must provide for old age
We should try to obtain peace
We must keep down expenses
We expect much of him
We sang songs in chorus
We need to nourish our spirit
They gained a victory
We said we should win
We are to preserve nature
We toiled up a hill
We spoke to no purpose
Our advance was checked
Ours is a mechanical age
Tom bats cleanup on our team
Blossoms develop from buds
The flower will come out soon
Insure your house against fire
Keep the fire alive
Be on your guard against fire
We sat over a fire
Few flowers develop into fruit
I have peace at home
The whole house was ill in bed
His whole family is like that
All my family is very well
I see the tower from my house
Summer vacation is near
It is so humid in summer here
The summer heat is rolling in
Grass is luxuriant in summer
There are several flowers
All things must have an end
I have no real intent
Few people are free of care
I ache for a sight of the sea
I cannot thank you too much
I got a rash from cosmetics
My lower abdomen feels bloated
Go downstairs and have a wash
Music has settled her nerves
Music feeds our imagination
Music moves the feelings
You left me in despair
I have her in my pocket
I gotta try to do my best
My papa said no
The roof is shining in the sun
The roof was dripping
Rain was pattering on the roof
Kings have long arms
Imagine that you have a wife
Salt is necessary for a cook
Salt is a useful substance
Any one will do
Not really
Distant things look blurred
Marriage is made in heaven
The banquet was in full swing
The yen rose to the dollar
How I wish I could swim
All the films are boring
The clouds are rolling away
The clouds are breaking
Exercise trains the muscles
The rumor turned out false
There are rumors in the air
I was made out to be a liar
The rain came down in earnest
The rain fell even harder
It looks like rain
We had better shut the windows
Down came the rain in torrents
It has ceased raining
The roads are wet
A heavy rain began to fall
It rained five days on end
There is no air in space
Space is full of mystery
Take the right road
I drank too much
The lightning flashed
I delivered identical twins
One book is thin
The other is thick
It was blowing hard all night
Learn a little at a time
Take three at a time
Youth comes but once in life
It is lonely to live alone
Not a moment could be lost
Write on alternate lines
The doctor felt his pulse
You may sit down in the chair
Not bad
The record is finished
Turn it over
The radio will not work
The other grasped his arm
He might have lost his way
Tom is keen on surfing
It tastes great
I wish you every happiness
Come on Tuesday if possible
Smoking does you harm
It began raining just now
The kite went upward
The timetable was disrupted
You ought not to smoke so much
Beyond that I cannot help you
It was sublime scenery
That goes without saying
It is all I want to do
Goodness knows what it was
The problem is beyond my power
The problem was beyond me
The tree is abundant in fruit
The law needs to be amended
The bill at last went through
The soldier lay dying
The story concluded abruptly
The cat is liked
The price includes postage
The man robbed me of my purse
The man lay motionless
The ship is about to set sail
The doll lay on the floor
The girl looked so pale
The book is of great value
The car consumes a lot of fuel
The car is in the way
Please move it
The child painted her father
The country was torn by war
The lecture was beyond me
The park is common property
The dog barks at strangers
Carry on with your plan
Its value trebled
The noise woke me
The yacht sailed round a buoy
The bus stops outside my house
The news spreads fast
Then he came to his senses
The computer was very useful
Two can play at that game
It removes misunderstandings
And my hands were shaking
Try by all means
I would like to see Mr Smith
A Mr Smith has come to see you
A Mr Smith came to see you
Do your homework at once
I did you wrong
Mr Jordan is chairperson
Jack is wise beyond all others
Until then
But the farmer smiled at him
But Tony was not a clever boy
Sally called on Mr Taylor
Down come the rain in torrents
The work can wait
Beyond this I know nothing
Please change this into pounds
These problems are beyond me
These apples are good cookers
This is above reason
This is the bible of baseball
This is very useful
These prices are ex works
This is a kind of love letter
Sorry
Traffic was heavy
This book is too dear for me
This dress creases easily
This cloth adheres to the skin
This road leads you there
This road leads to Hong Kong
Opinions vary on this point
This street is lively
This area is devastated
This river abounds in trout
Danger ahead
This fabric stains easily
This bond is null and void
This car needs repairing
Oil this bicycle
This tooth is decayed
This tooth is wobbly
This ring is expensive
Show me some cheap ones
This result dashed his hopes
This tie suits him well
This scarf feels soft
This soup has no substance
This coat may well fit you
Burn this rubbish on the fire
This whisky is too strong
This is Mr Smith speaking
This is better by far
This is Mr Yasuda
It is quiet here at night
Elephants abound here
Make coffee
Mind you come on time
Carlos turned round
Cuckoos visit here in spring
You look very tired
Please hang on
You always sing
Beware of smooth talk
Please leave some money
I meant no harm
Ellie is very feminine
Tie the apron
I know what
The rumor proved true
I sleep lying on my face
Mr Wilson is angry with Dennis
Take England for example
One day I found a box there
One morning he went for a walk
Every insult was thrown at him
I can not stand that noise
That red dress becomes her
That politician is an old fox
The woman served her purpose
Follow the car
That child is always fretting
Look above that building
That dress really becomes her
You will study
You can understand me
You are too kind to me
You have two brothers
He is so heartless
All three hated one another
It leaves every thirty minutes
He will be back in an hour
I asked her
Mind your own business
He is a merry fellow
You be quiet
The crowd yelled with delight
The stepmother was hard on her
Feed chickens with seeds
Art brings bread
The result is still in doubt
I have bloody stools
Attached is my monthly report
Speak plain truth
She has constructive ideas
A dog ran about in the garden
Learn humility
You look down
I have hard stools
Correct errors
We saw a small island beyond
Can you see Mt
You may come and go at will
Looks like another nice day
Stick it out
The performance was excellent
Empty the purse into this bag
It was sultry last night
Eat and drink up
I have a previous appointment
You get off at Yotsuya Station
Never say die
We are human
We were chatting over tea
We have got used to that noise
We were sitting comfortably
We are going to the movies
Come with us
We felt the earth tremble
We were welcomed warmly
We were shocked at the news
We gave way to their demands
We cannot rely on her kindness
I cannot afford to buy it
He did it unbeknownst to me
He acted fairly towards me
Let me know your exam results
My opinion differs from his
In my beginning is my end
I had my watch mended
My car needs repairing
My son can read a clock
He is only a baby in my eyes
I cannot answer your question
I like my shrimps fried
I am boarding with my uncle
I do not have any money
I want to mend this watch
I put this question to him
I washed my shirt clean
I visited Paris long ago
I met a certain Mr Smith
I am acquainted with Mr Smith
I gained admission to the club
I was ill for weeks after
The car overtook me
I stressed the point
I like the actor
I feel below par
I will go there no more
I used to go skiing in winter
I do not like music
I was on the hunt for lodgings
I spent an idle week there
I keep nothing secret from you
Do your assignment yourself
I gave up smoking for health
I had the door mended
I lead a happy life
I have never been to Hiroshima
I am terrified of heights
I come from Saitama
I consulted with my sister
I turned page after page
I am from Shizuoka
I want to go straight
I have never called on him
I found her mending a skirt
I wish her happiness
I do not read books
I stick to the point
I believe in the life beyond
So do I
I hope you will hear me out
We mended some broken chairs
We have some plans in view
We often went skiing in winter
We are on good terms with them
We must see things as they are
The game was drawn
You must keep your teeth clean
Put the clock right
Nature abhors a vacuum
The fact is that she is ill
He was as good as his word
Society is built on trust
Keep your hand still
Remember to post the letter
Learn a trade
I sat the exam only to fail it
Autumn weather is changeable
I have soft stools
I would sooner stay than go
You will melt
The heat has died down
Let me see your wound
The small print looks faded
A stream flows into the lake
Drink water from a stream
A little pot is soon hot
All right
Excellent putt
I think it depends
Everything is against us
I ate myself sick
You may as well go to bed now
Sincere apologies
My heart quickened
All was still in the woods
The woods are my home
Truth needs not many words
Gentlemen first
People hailed him as king
Life is indeed a good thing
Water finds its own level
Several people lay wounded
The stars twinkled
The stars are glittering above
The stars twinkled above her
Cut a square in halves
Raw fish easily goes bad
Old habits die hard
Hold the baby gently
Better to bend than break
Much snow has fallen
Snow is falling thick and fast
Snow lies thick on the ground
Absolutely not
Over my dead body
Cut into long thin strips
The war made the country poor
Wars bring scars
The ship is bearing due north
The ship cast anchor at Kobe
The ship sailed down the river
I had a good report last term
The good die young
He is utterly impossible
He has plenty of cheek
I am all ears
Get up early
Same as usual
Open the window
Stop finding fault with others
Many trees are bare in winter
The sun was about to rise
The sun rises above the houses
The sun glared down on us
The sun was shining bright
Avoid those men who are idle
The price was absurdly high
The ground is wet after rain
Stay with me till dawn
The town slept
The whole town lay sleeping
We are not amused
I passed a boy in the street
Sadako gave a weak nod
The enemy answered our fire
The train jerked forward
All my efforts came to nothing
The rain is teeming down
Winter is gone
The poll was taken yesterday
My head feels heavy
My head hurts
The road dips suddenly
The road is uphill all the way
The road rises from there
I wish you a good journey
The bell rang suddenly
I know how Piggy feels
Never will I see her again
He came back two days after
Sunburn irritates the skin
I want to age gracefully
I have mucous in my stool
The waves are subsiding
The sea was white with foam
I have pain when urinating
A tall woman came along
Shoppers crowded the streets
She touched her hair
It was wet
Your tooth must be extracted
The noes have it
A rebellion was brewing
The revolt was crushed
He has a lot of confidence
He cannot have said so
He designed the new building
Sport has made him what he is
He cannot have been ill
He is a childhood friend
He and I cannot speak Spanish
Ask him the way to the station
I got him to mend my watch
All of us went besides him
His opinion is quite just
His house is beyond the hill
Everything about him was grey
He is more or less drunk
His statement lacks sincerity
His words offended me
His idea is identical to mine
His work is beyond all praise
He is a doctor by profession
I was offended at his behavior
His new car looked all right
His report proved to be false
His life ran smoothly
His voice quavered with anger
His strength is waning
His attitude disgusts me
His efforts bore fruit
His land abuts on the road
He was guarded in his remarks
His report proved false
He is a kind man at heart
He made a vivid impression
He is not an American
He rejected all the objections
He is a good fellow
He sank into a chair
He usually comes in time
He always speaks well of her
He still believes her words
He is above telling lies
He has come out of his shell
He tells a good joke
He kept silent for a while
He will get well very soon
He fell asleep right away
He has a nice build
He is a lover of sports
He took part in the meeting
He was silent all the time
He absconded with the money
He has got over the trouble
He may have been ill then
He tied the parcel up
He said nothing on that point
He was explicit on the point
He laid claim to the land
He read the book through
He did it of his own accord
He usually succeeded
He is a robust young man
He invented a false rumor
He scraped mud from the door
He is a very modest man
He is a pretty great guy
He acted the fool
He was far ahead of his time
He is a handsome young man
He is a heroin addict
He is a mere child
He no longer lives here
He lived a moral life
He traveled all over Europe
He lost his beloved son
He gave a sigh of relief
He is notorious as a liar
He dwells on his past failures
He is a sort of painter
He lived a simple life
He was red with anger
He cried and cried
He cried out
He lay face up
He is a rich but dull man
He tried to buy into the club
He stood looking at the sky
He is an expert in economics
He enjoys good health
He wandered around the lake
He met with a traffic accident
He made up an excuse
He is a man of noble birth
He is rotten to the core
He is now at the desk
He is older and wiser now
He is living in Tokyo
He is off today
He is in high spirits today
He is a good fellow at heart
He finally surrendered to her
He fells trees on the mountain
He set about his work
He is absorbed in his work
He gave us a false story
He mended my umbrella
He is a better swimmer than I
He is a man of wealth
He was too proud to do it
He clings to his customs
He made a lot of easy money
He is a man of ability
He crossed himself
He is cut out for hard work
He is a proficient pianist
He is out for promotion
He chose painting as a career
He turned tail and ran
He cannot be trusted
He greeted her with cordiality
He gave a deep sigh
He is kindness itself
He had a kindly manner
He motioned us away
He has seen much of the world
He is said to be honest
He lost color
He prefers the quiet
He fell overboard and drowned
He lay down on the grass
He did run
He disdained bribery
He dotes on his grandson
He had to undergo many trials
He is very hard on lazy people
He is anything but that
He blushed with shame
He is far from a genius
He likes to live in Tokyo
He has been ill since Sunday
He does not like cats
He is very ill with pneumonia
He received much applause
He is bound to her
He is close to her
Her name was often on his lips
He caught her by the arm
He seems to be ill
He was absent owing to illness
He acted as if he were ill
He heaped up a fortune
He was subjected to insult
He acted on the stage
He is diligent in his study
He lived a busy life
He cares little for my advice
He plays dirty pool
He calls her up every night
He stands for democracy
He is to start tomorrow
He collided with a tree
He is a famous merchant
There was no budging him

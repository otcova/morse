The children all ran outside
Christmas is a joyful time
I work all day
We all thought he was crazy
They all thought Tom was crazy

That could work

Wisdom cannot be imparted
I beat you fair and square
I hate holidays
The home shows the soul
Mary wears a headscarf
They prefer a window seat

Beer is my fuel
But she was not scared
I am too old for it
On the table is a book
I am dying of hunger
This is a bus
This is a stone
This is a shop
It is singular
It is plural
The bus takes you down town

This is just a ten minute walk
I saw the movie long ago

I happen to have it right here
He is about to fall sleep
Tom is about to fall asleep
He is on this ship
My uncle is in his forties
I felt overwhelmed
I had fun dancing
We had fun dancing
Ours is founded upon hatred

I could tell Tom was hurt
I had fun doing that
I wonder when Tom will be home
I love westerns

He had many good friends there
Let me do something else
I think that Tom is dangerous
You need to get your hair cut
The ground quaked violently
The lorry tipped over
Tom lowered the flame
Tom often comes here
No one wanted to listen to me
Stop jumping on the bed
The bin is empty
Silk is soft and smooth
The school is on a hill
The dog follows me everywhere
Say it in German

He is under the chair
She is under the chair

This is the picture he painted
You have wonderful eyes
John has a Japanese car
She grew up in Japan and China
She wants to try Japanese food
I bet Tom could help
I knew Tom would win
Dinner was excellent
I lent Tom my camera
You are not powerful
It is harmful to get angry
I am sorry
It smells strange here
Everybody needs help
Everyone can hear it
It was really pretty
I doubt Tom will sing
None of us are happy
I lent Tom my bicycle
Nothing is final yet
He was quiet
Everyone had a good year
This is the starting point
We agreed to meet Tom
She caught him looking at her
She looked angry
He looked angry
I am on the current
Tame birds dream of freedom
Her work is also valuable
I hope Tom will do that

Always
Such a thing often happens

We agonized over this
We agonized over this decision

We want our voices to be heard
We understand it only too well
We sustained some minor damage
We should be safe in our homes
We should be awesome next year
We should all sleep easier now
We picked up where we left off
We only have their word for it
We never took that for granted
We need to stay out of the way
We need to respect our farmers
We need to make a break for it
We need to lay low for a while
We need to break radio silence
We know who the terrorists are
We just take one day at a time
We just need to win more games
We just need the will to do so
We just have to make it happen
We have to protect our economy
We have to pay for what we buy
We have to look at the results
We have to live in the present
We have some things to clarify
We have some catching up to do
We flew from Boston that night
We ask everyone to participate
Traffic was immediately halted
Tourism is very important here
Thousands of kids were adopted
Thousands of jobs were created
This was a learning experience
This uncertainty is unbearable
This situation is unacceptable
This might seem insurmountable
This is totally achievable now
This is straightforward enough
This is no time for your jokes
This is clearly discrimination
This is an illegal transaction
This is a learning opportunity
This has profound implications
This continues to be maddening
This can be extremely damaging
This book was a disappointment
Think globally but act locally
They will have been dealt with
They were stopped and arrested
They were holding their ground
They have found several bodies
They could make the difference
They called for reinforcements
They all responded immediately
These sinkholes are time bombs
These require careful handling
These playing cards are marked
There was an adjustment period
There ought to be consequences
There must be an investigation
There are varying explanations
There are grounds for optimism
Their customer service is poor
Their conversation grew heated
The two robberies were related
The transformation it complete
The suffering was unimaginable
The result is easily predicted
The rest is purely speculation
The quarterback is really good
The process took several weeks
The policy was quickly changed
The place is practically empty

Nobody did anything after that
No suspects have been arrested

Neither was wearing a seatbelt
My children attend that school
Move carefully to avoid injury
Many attacks may go unreported
It was helpful and interesting
It was an intriguing situation
It was an extraordinary moment
It was an embarrassing episode
It was a harmless school prank
It sounds absolutely wonderful
It could be hugely significant
It apparently no longer exists
Investigators say it was arson
Injuries can happen to anybody
I wish we could leave the ship
I wish there was one in Boston
I was nervous at the beginning
I was finding it too difficult
I was acquitted of all charges
I want you to come every night
I waited until I had the money
I vowed never to go back there
I ventured off the beaten path
I used to hate washing my face
I try to keep as many as I can
I tried to cover all the bases
I think you make this stuff up
I think we timed it just right
I think we can do it this year
I think we all know the answer
I think time is of the essence
I think it would bore me stiff
I take responsibility for that
I suddenly felt really strange
I remember when food was cheap
I remember the plane was empty
I rarely step out of the house
I phoned my mom to say goodbye
I never got back into coaching
I must let you know how I feel
I may have to replace it again
I make a very good poached egg
I love you too much to do that
I love that kind of dedication
I love it when things go wrong
I lost three friends last year
I like to be a little creative
I like the options I have here
I knew it was you all the time
I knew I wanted to play better
I just want to keep on writing
I just want to be a part of it
I just tried to get through it
I just tried not to mess it up
I just take my life day by day
I just felt sick to my stomach
I hope to enjoy myself as well
I hope I made it clear for you
I heard a noise from the porch
I have too much to think about
I have to have more confidence
I have people who work with me
I have no sympathy for smokers
I have no authority to veto it
I have a son in private school
I have a lot more up my sleeve
I had been incarcerated before
I had a terrific day on Monday
I had a scholarship to college
I find this all so interesting
I find that terribly troubling
I eat my meals at the hospital
I do have some control over it
I did nothing unethical at all
I deserve a relaxing afternoon
I carry a gun most of the time
I can scarcely believe my eyes
I can do it with my bare hands
I came in not knowing anything
I believe this must be stopped
I ask myself the same question
Five prototypes were completed
Fighting poverty is the answer

Tom turned to Mary and laughed
We want to keep the pool open
We want to have fun with this
Tom took his anger out on Mary
We want nothing short of that
We want complete transparency
Tom told his side of the story
We used to throw parties here
We strongly condemn such acts
Tom stooped to pick up a stick
We squeezed into the elevator
We promise to keep you posted
Tom stepped out on the balcony
We never got a chance to play
We need to put this behind us
Tom stepped into the spotlight
We must still be very careful
We must not make any mistakes
Tom started to feel very dizzy
We must not be afraid to fail
We must be extremely vigilant
Tom spoke to Mary in a whisper
We kind of lucked out on that
Tom should count his blessings
We just have to keep doing it

We intend to right that wrong
We hope the governor signs it
We hope that there is closure

It was like Christmas morning
It was clearly something else
It was an overnight sensation
It was an excellent editorial
It was absolutely devastating

It helped me out tremendously
Tom curled up on the davenport

It scared me to death
It kind of surprised me
I ate light
No one is responding
No one is answering
No one answers
Pack your stuffs dear
I ordered plane tickets for us
My wife is italian
She looks like a Russian
It is getting bigger
I am lots of fun
I also enjoy writing a lot
Everything was new to me
Everyone looked at my feet
Tom seemed real impressed
He stretched his arm
Steve looks quite happy
Tom enjoys telling jokes
Tom is here with me now
Tom is missing a few teeth
Tom is very witty
Tom is with me every day
Tom just wants my money
Tom knows me very well
Tom looks quite happy
Tom loves to tell stories
Tom never once hit me
Tom once worked for me
Tom once worked with me
Tom taught me how to read
Tom taught me to read
Tom thought I was crazy
Tom told me that today
Tom used to be scared of dogs
Tom used to be scared of me
Tom was better than me
Tom was friendly to me
Tom was my only child
The two dogs treed the raccoon
Girls like to play house
I must hide
They died one after the other
I just wish I could be at home
Everyone left except for us
His heart beat with excitement
I must reject your request
The gate opened all by itself
It is almost time to go home
I wish my wife could cook
Mary wore a large hat
The duchess wore a large hat
Tom squashed the bug
The programmer fixed the bug
I wonder what caused that
I wonder what this means
I wonder why that is
I wish Tom the best
I wish I were wrong
Please adopt this puppy
Please adopt this cat
She has survived three wars
A book is a wonderful gift
I was red as a tomato
Today is Pi Day
Mary baked a pie for Pi Day
I know all my neighbors
I know exactly how it is
I know that sounds crazy
I know there are others
I know they were there
I know this is stupid
I know times are tough
I know Tom was there
I know what I like
I know what it takes
I know where Tom lives
I know you were afraid
I know you work hard
That person is not trustworthy
This dishwasher is too big
Nobody likes to do laundry
Laundry is a chore
Tom has a steam shower
The party is waiting
All the hotels are sold out
She asked me to leave the room
He is looking for an apartment
The sun will set in two hours
She was there last summer
We need paper
Tom was noticeably tense
He returned from Denmark
We wrote three books
They wrote three books
Wash your legs
Drop by sometime
Heroin is highly addictive
I actually love my job
I can see a pattern
I can work with anyone
I had plenty of time
I had to be aggressive
I have a simple solution
I have a spare key
I have a young daughter
I have no definite plans
I have no other option
I have no proof
I have nothing to share
I have the same question
I have tickets to sell
I have to be optimistic
You need to be more aggressive
I just read your post
I just want some time
I just want to win
I knew it was possible
I knew nothing about it
I knew what it was
Ken did that
I had three options
I have three options
I knew what Tom wanted
I let my friends down
I let my teammates down
I like dogs a lot
I like dogs and cats
I like it better now
I like it this way
I like school
I like your avatar
I liked all of that
I lived there for years
I loaned Tom some money
I look forward to that
I look like my father
I lost my entire family
I love living on campus
I love my team
I love the people here
I love those three kids
I love to tell stories
I love to write music
I made a typing error
I made too many errors
I met Tom for lunch
I might have a chance
I must leave at once
I must stay where I am
I need a better job
I need to keep moving
I need to see that
I never told you that
I never wrote that down
I only had three options
I only want to talk
I owe everything to Tom
I passed the test
I planned it very well
I prefer to stay indoors
I really have a problem
I really like it here
I really like this team
I really like to read
I really liked it there
I really loved the show
I really need a friend
I refuse to sit there
I remained where I was
I respect Tom a lot
I slammed the door shut
I sort of liked that
I spoke to Tom myself
I still really like it
I still wake up early
I still wonder about it
I think I like Tom
I think I need therapy
I think it looks awesome
I think it looks cool
I think it looks great
I think it scared Tom
I think it sounds good
I think it was silly
I think it was useful
I think it was wrong
I think they look good
I think they were right
I think they were wrong
I think this is better
I think this is dumb
I think this is fair

I think time will tell
I think Tom is an idiot

I think Tom would say yes
I think we were awesome
I thought it was awesome
I thought it was fake
I thought that was crazy
I thought that was great
I thought that was right
I thought Tom looked OK
I thought Tom was retired
I thought we played well
I thought you loved that
I thought you were retired
I tried to be aggressive
I tried to look innocent
I try to stay involved
I used to wear glasses
I want a new house
I want to keep playing
I want to resign
I want to retire here
I want Tom to succeed
I want you to comment
I want you to suffer
I wanted out of there
I wanted to be cautious
I wanted to be ready
I wanted to leave
I wanted to make sure
I wanted to run home
I wanted to smack you
I wanted to steal it
I was a good student
I was curious about that
I was freaked out
I was happy to leave
I was happy with that
I was just really lucky
I was kind of nervous
I was only thirteen then
I was open and honest
I was proud of myself
I was surprised about it
I was sworn to secrecy
I was there once before
I was there three days
I was working that night
I wonder what Tom thinks
I wonder where Tom is from
I wondered where Tom was
I was compelled to follow her
We are eating apples
We eat apples
I will be learning
I was feeling the same
I see the sky
Duty calls to me
She left home at age thirteen
I reddened like a tomato
He was a formidable opponent
Please give me a pound of meat
You deserve congratulations
That was a formidable opponent
Better less than nothing
I know that this is weird
Once a year does not hurt
I am resistant to cold
The picture was beautiful
You should have seen it
Tom has the right attitude
I am studying French by myself
I identified him immediately
You really made me proud
Tom thought I was lying
Tom is right here with me
Tom is named after his father
Tom certainly has a temper
Tom always made me laugh
They were laughing at me
They wanted to punish me
The odds were against me
The odds are against me
That made perfect sense to me
Some of my friends smoke
Please wait a while longer
Nobody would talk to me
My mother never liked me
Music is important to me
I was certainly lucky
I thought you were married
I thought you were happy here
I thought Tom was awesome
I thought it was terrible
I thought it was shocking
I thought it was possible
I thought it was pathetic
I thought about my family
I think Tom is still around
I think Tom is really smart
I think I understand you
I talked to Tom yesterday
I take vitamins every day
I still make mistakes
I still love classic rock
I really needed Tom there
I really love working out
I really like your music
I might not sleep tonight
I love watching you work
I love watching you dance
I know it sounds familiar
I know how important it is
I have to plan everything
I have a serious question
I always think about that
I always liked Tom better
I actually really like it
I always think about it
I will take three of each kind
The battle lasted a week
Tom was sitting behind me
Tom is turning thirteen
This is my third marriage
These are my best friends
That sounds like treason to me
That seems inhumane to me
Thanks for having me here
Nobody knows me in Boston
I hate the smell of garlic
My name sounds bizarre
My name sounds strange
She visited the zoo with him
You may not enter that room
I thought I performed well
I think Tom likes baseball
I think Tom is very smart
You are very intelligent
We are buying movie tickets
You have no scruples
The war goes on
I seldom see her
She waited for the bus
Tom does what is asked of him
I only want her to feel well
I just want her to feel well
That is not an island
He is sitting at the table
She likes books too
He is speaking loudly
She likes books also
She also likes books
Tom put the map on the table
It refuses to die
Prison is the school of crime
Your closet is already full
We just ate dinner
They all went in
There are a few houses around
He started again
She has never seen the sea
I was very sober at the time
It is me who is paying
They will order a new desk
He showed us photos
The house is suitably isolated
He ruined his clothes
Go explore that
He has a lot of work to do
Tom stopped using Facebook
Tom arrived this morning
I think Tom is progressing
I think Tom is pretty angry
I think it was intentional
I think I missed something
I think everybody is ready
I think about Tom sometimes
I think about it sometimes
I suppose that makes sense
I respect people like that
I really like my teammates
I passed every single test
I passed all my tests
I am not a pillow
I will give him a recipe
I will give her a recipe
I will give you a recipe
He is an idiot
It is too early to go to bed
The company is in debt
I am fed up with my old fridge
Pigeons and hens are birds
Our relationship is stable
I have never seen him
But there are other advantages
Ganon gloated
Morshu joined
Come eat with us
The square root of one is one
The voters have spoken
He is a numpty
She has never seen the ocean
We are content
I enjoyed it a great deal
On the contrary
They made a little paper plane
Tom died in his prime
Tony jogs every day
Have a look at the girls
Tom read novels
The party was awfully boring
He must have already come
Mary agreed
He agreed
Throw it away
Stop it
The egg is hard
I drink beer
Everything is in flux
The drain is clogged again
You should introduce yourself
The statue in the park is new
One is not a prime number
Ice is cool
I use them to serve humanity
A lot of people sure tell lies
Thomas swam
My room must be a mess
Tom will be shocked
Tom thought I was serious
Tom read my mind perfectly
Tom probably saved my life
Tom is someone that I trust
Tom is someone I trust
Tom is really upset with me
Tom is really angry at me
Tom is not my friend anymore
I must buy shoes
Mammals have hair
The food in jail was better
That was something I wanted
That was my initial thought
That was my biggest problem
That was interesting to me
That seems reasonable to me
That almost made me laugh
Tell me about your children
Someone parked in my spot
Somebody might stop me
People treat me with respect
That sounds like music to me
That seems irresponsible to me
I watch very little television
I took responsibility for that
I thought that was interesting
I thought it was inappropriate
I thought it looked ridiculous
I think that shocked everybody
I regret this decision already
I can understand your position
I was just playing basketball
I thought that was remarkable
I think about that constantly
I was very impressed by that
I was a little bit surprised
I thought that was thrilling
I thought that was fantastic
I thought everybody liked it
I really want another chance
I left everything in my room
I just wanted an opportunity
I have three college degrees
I have absolutely no regrets
Have dinner with me tomorrow
Everybody is looking for Tom
Both my sisters are teachers
Nothing else mattered to me
I thought it was refreshing
I thought it was incredible
I think they were surprised
I think they knew something
I have a serious girlfriend
Everything looks good to me
Everything looks fine to me
Everybody was looking at me
My mom was a schoolteacher
I tried to resuscitate Tom
I thought it worked nicely
I thought it was marvelous
I thought it was heartburn
I think Tom is working now
I now understand it better
I never really was nervous
I never even mentioned Tom
I made a horrible decision
I left everything in there
I actually really liked it
I thought Tom was serious
I think Tom was surprised
I think Tom looked happy
I think Tom is satisfied
I like those sunglasses
I thought that was fun
I love roller coasters
I love my independence
I ignored their advice
I was being facetious
No one will stop you
I just started today
I have work tomorrow
I actually like that
We have a good team
No one will stop us
It might be a shark
We had so much fun
Tom was a nice kid
Tom was a good kid
Tom is now in jail
Tom is a good chef
This is a new idea
No one is at fault
No one had to wait
Kids make mistakes
It was so much fun
It was lots of fun
It was a sad story
It was a nice race
It was a lucky win
It was a long wait
It was a great day
It was a good race
It took us a while
I have a complaint
We miss Tom a lot
We look up to you
We can work on it
Tom was a big man
Tom is a wise man
Tom is a big baby
It was a long day
It was a hard day
It was a cold day
I know how to win
A lot is at stake
We had a fun day
Tom is a big man
Tom is a big guy
We want respect
We want freedom
Tom woke us up
You must wait
Tom needed it
She lives with her parents
This was all free
This is our job
That might not be Tom
No one knew why
It was inconvenient
It was hard for Tom
It was great to see you again
It was good fun
It was a tough game
It was a nice place
It was a great race
It was a fun game to watch
It was a big hassle
It used to be worse
I have a plan in mind
Complaints are rare
This applies to love as well
Buy two kilos of meat
We like your car
The passport is clearly fake
Drop your pants
The sea was warm today
Mary decided to quit smoking
Smoking is a repulsive habit
A little lower
He learned to raise cattle
Bill really drinks too much
Tom really drinks too much
Tom drinks way too much
He wants to go to the sea
Now I know the whole truth
I came to talk with Tom
Money gives birth to money
Money begets money
Tom is lying to us
Long hair is a pain
No one had a chance
No one has a weapon
No one has paid yet
No one knew a thing
No one looked at it
Some of us think so
That was a bad idea
This is a good idea
This is a real mess
This is a tough one
This is all for Tom
This is all we have
This is good for us
This is kind of sad
Tom had no idea why
Tom had to say that
Tom has a tough job
Tom has the day off
Tom is a great boss
Tom is a poor loser
Tom is next in line
Tom is such a moron
Tom looks up to you
Tom may not make it
Tom now wears a wig
Tom ran a good race
Tom taught us a lot
Tom was quite a guy
We know Tom is poor
We like to have fun
We miss you so much
We need a new truck
We need to be quick
We need to be ready
We tried to be good
We use it every day
You need to be firm
Your home is a mess
This is all there is
This place is a dump
Tom has a great idea
Tom has one of those
Tom sat on the fence
Too much is at stake
We really had a lot of fun
Tom may not make it on time
They accepted that
She is busy typing up reports
Many Chinese live in Africa
Politics is hypocrisy
Parrots are very smart birds
Tom works on his own
Tom will see to that
Tom was sure of that
Tom was right not to do that
Tom was a coal miner
Tom wants us to stay
Tom volunteered to do that
Tom used to be weird
Tom tried to stop it
Tom tried to kill us
Tom stands up for us
Your book is upside down
He took out an egg
I guess we found it
Tom says he likes it
Tom said we can stay
Tom said that was OK
Tom said it was bad
Tom needs to wise up
Tom needs to wake up
Tom needs to shut up
Tom needs to lay low
Tom needs to be told
Tom needs to be here
I know we can win
This will take time
This will take a lot of time
This seems excessive
This may not be true
This is what we need
This is our land now
This is how it works
This is an old story
This is a list of what we need
This is a bit unfair
It was fiendishly cold
Help me take this down
Our team could win
Be nice to your kids
Patience begins where it ends
A dog is sitting on the carpet
The ball was called out
The ball was called in
The ball was called out
First service
First serve
Second service
Second serve
Nothing
Evidently not
Ties suit you
I got soaking wet
The earthquake shook the house
It happens automatically
I hate work
None of us knew the answer
The USA is a republic
None of us are planning to go
The book sells well
Do what the doctor said
None of us like Tom
We voted against the proposal
None of us want to do that
Someone rang the doorbell
Argon is a noble gas
This expression is archaic
This is an archaism
His words hurt Meg
I recognize you
Just then the phone rang
It speaks for itself
Art has no borders
Art has no limits
She died of oxygen deprivation
Your breath stinks of garlic
I have Russian friends
Your breath stinks
You smell bad
I had a full time job with him
You should be seen by a doctor
I discovered a serious mistake
Tom seems to be crying
I am thankful
Hold on a minute
My shoelaces are untied
He knows he acted badly
She was red like a tomato
She knows
Please move your car
He smells the soup
Tom wanted to turn the page
I am awaiting an agreement
Tom may not be happy
Tom may have a point
Tom knows we know it
Tom knows that we know
Tom knows how to win
Tom is such an idiot
Tom is such a coward
Tom is short for Thomas
Tom is ready to lead
Tom is out of shape
Tom is home again
Tom is his real name
Tom is a true leader
Tom is a good runner
Tom is a good player
Tom is a busy fellow
Tom has no free time
Tom has had a stroke
Tom has a little boy
Tom had to stay home
They sing
This is not my cat
They can come
They smoke
He can fly
That is my brother
They dream
You do not wash
The book was new
I own one cat and one dog
I own one dog and one cat
It was warm yesterday
I will see you tomorrow
I can walk there on foot
I own a white and black dog
They were singing
A cat is on the table
Tom is a papyrologist
She is quite impartial
Tall trees catch a lot of wind
This forest is very dense
They began arguing over money
She winked at Tom
Mary winked at Tom
He pulled her a little closer
Tom lives in a treehouse
It was quiet in there
It was pure luck
It was lots of money
It was kind of scary
It was easy to obtain
It was an easy choice
It was a tough choice
It was a team effort
It was a good choice
It was a funny moment
It seems a bit unfair
Matter is made of atoms
Protons are made up of quarks
It was a bit daunting
It was a big decision
It used to be bigger
It used to be better
It must be hard work
It may take time
It may not matter
That was a good trip
That may not be true
No one will tell you
No one will ever know
No one was quite sure
No one was in danger
No one wanted it
No one seems to know
No one knew about it
No one else was there
No more need be said
Most of us know that
Mary is a lovely girl
Anyone can volunteer
All Tom wants is love
Tom found a dinosaur egg
No more needs to be said
They want to see you
They said it was bad
They need to be told
They may be wrong
They know how to win
There was a long wait
There was a bad smell
The men all wore hats
The long wait is over
The game was sold out
That was a tough one
That was a month ago
That was a good year
Your idea is good
Your idea is a good one
You may not be right
You may be wrong
You know you need it
We worked hard at it
We wish Tom the best
We want to live here
We tried to warn you
We thought Tom was OK
We think Tom will be OK
We talk all the time
We still want to win
We practice a lot
We only won one game
We only have one son
We need to think big
We need more of this
We need more of that
We need a new leader
We move around a lot
We know this is real
We know how Tom is
We know how they are
We knew Tom was tough
We knew Tom was unhappy
We knew Tom was there
We knew Tom was in Boston
We just met today
We have to slow down
We have to pay taxes
We have three days left
We have seen to that
We have faith in you
We have faith in Tom
We have a new leader
We have a house here
We have a great team
We all have one vote
Tom needs a new plan
Tom might not want to help us
Tom might not want to do that
Tom might be the best
Tom left a lot behind
Tom led a simple life
Tom knows Mary is away
Tom knows how to play chess
Tom knew where he was

The bees are disappearing
He said he was tired
The room was cleaned by Tom
Take a short walk every day
We may never know why
We lost all our money
We look forward to it
We like Tom just fine
We left on good terms
We know what it means
We knew Tom had talent
We just wanted to win
We have too much debt
We have three of them
We have the same goal
We have plenty of room
We have one more year
We have no other debt
We had a busy weekend
Tom won by three points
Tom was there for you
Tom was there as well
Tom was the lucky guy
Tom was taught by Mary
Tom was taken to jail
Tom was shot to death
Tom was ready to work
Tom was ready to quit
Tom was killed in Boston
Tom was killed by Mary
Tom was invited by us
Tom was first in line
Tom was a good worker
Tom wants to sit down
Tom tried to save Mary
Tom took off for home
Tom took Mary with him

Tom seems to know how to do it
Tom seems to be smart
Tom says not to worry

Tom only used it once
Tom often wears a black hat
Tom offered Mary a job
Tom now works for Mary

Tom is a very nice man
Tom is a very nice kid
Tom has had a good life
This one is the worst
This is where we live
This is way more than we need
This is just too easy
This is a major issue
This is a good system
This is a big project
This is a big problem
They like it that way
It rained that day
It really was hard
It sure looks cool
It turned out fine
Tom knows the area
Tom may never leave
We still have to go
Tom manages a hotel
We need Tom out here
We respect Tom a lot
It was no coincidence
Hunger is the best seasoning
He was right behind me
I want to see your mom
I want to see your dad
Coloring is fun
Bunnies are very cute
Bunnies are social animals
We were quite happy
Luck was on our side
Tom kept it a secret
We have to work hard
Let Tom have some fun
Tom slept on the sofa
Tom wanted to be good
We missed Tom so much
We must not stop here
We need that from Tom
We need the truth now
We need to be prudent
We need to move ahead
We need to start over
We needed to have fun
We really want to win
We respect them a lot
We talked for a while
We were in last place
You can never be sure
You have a good point
You may need a shovel
You need one of those

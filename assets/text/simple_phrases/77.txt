Ponder deeply over it
The cake tastes sweet
The curtain wants cleaning
It removes misunderstandings
And there were three
Stop going there
The idea made my soul rise
You are kind to say so
That makes for efficiency
He might at least apologize
You should have visited Kyoto
Try by all means
Strike the set
Mr Smith teaches me English
Mr Smith is a good teacher
Mr Smith sued them for damages
Smith demanded payment
Smith struck Jones out
The Smiths are our cousins
Mr Smith made him a doctor
Mr Smith made him some toys
Mr Smith is now on duty
Mr Smith lives in Kyoto now
I do not do sports
I love music as well as sports
We must surrender them all
Bring everything to ruin
Everything was burnt to ashes
Every star is a sphere
I know a little Spanish
The beefsteak tasted marvelous
We cannot go into the studio
Sparrows were flying about
Some songs come from Scotland
I hope you will answer me soon
I get hysterical easily
Opportunity makes a thief
Switzerland boasts many sights
John began trade personally
John cannot play the guitar
Mr Jordan is chairperson
Sew buttons onto a shirt
I hope to visit Sydney again
We made a date to meet soon
But he was lucky
But not really
But very very difficult
Jane was boiling
Jane spent a very flat weekend
I want to go to Seattle
Cool fall is here
It poured down
We cannot meet your demands
Your bereavement saddens me
The same to you
At your convenience
Your kindness overwhelms me
I acknowledge your kindness
For your information
For your consideration
Please confirm
I hope this fine weather holds
This is for free
This I have done
They are memorials
Bless these little children
Check these papers over
No passage this way
This is above reason
This is between ourselves
This means nil
This is the coffee
Sorry
Traffic was heavy
I have leg cramps
These vegetables cook slowly
This dress creases easily
This cloth wears well
Put this Japanese into English
You clown you
This fabric stains easily
This cloth irons well
This water is sterilized
This color becomes you
We request this address
This car needs repairing
This bicycle needs oiling
This bicycle needs repairing
This watch wants mending
This job eats money
This quenched my hope
This tooth is decayed
This tooth is wobbly
This thread tangles easily
This metal burnishes well
This bridge looks secure
This classroom is cleaned
This flower smells sweet
This dress is YOU
This label sticks easily
This hotel does not take dogs
Put this bench forward
This film develops fast
This beefsteak smells good
This beer tastes bitter
This beer is dry
The butter tasted sour
This tape sticks well
This scarf feels soft
This skirt hangs nicely
This soup smacks of fish
This shirt wants washing
This jacket sets well
This coffee tastes burnt
This camera is dutiable
Mother chose this curtain
These oranges mature fast
Overseas service here
This is Goroh Watanabe
This is Mr Yasuda
Pepper burned his mouth
Open up your mind
Traffic is busy here
Elephants abound here
We had better not remain here
Here were some relics
Here are two stamps
Do study here
I prefer coke to coffee
Coffee ends a meal
Thus he succeeded
I doubt these generalizations
Ken lighted the candles
Mr Green keeps a little dog
Kumi made a box
Whales come under mammals
The captain commanded silence
Your knowledge surprises me
I bet he will get mad
To hear is to obey
Canada abounds in timber
It is hard frozen
I apologize for it
Good to see you
Mother bathed the baby
Please respond
Hold in your stomach
Dad is a hard worker
We should be kind to the aged
The weather is crook
It moves the bowels
You always sing
Beware of smooth talk
No gratuity accepted
No drinkers
Please leave some money
Money will do anything
Money answers all things
Money counts for little
I was nicely framed
I think what you say is true
Grandfather speaks very slowly
Wolves stalked the flock
Parrots imitate human speech
I smell smoke in the elevator
Tie the apron
AIDS has broken out
I know what
A good idea came upon me
Our dog has gone away
I heard a Japanese nightingale
India is populous
Potatoes give me wind
I have never been to Nikko
I write articles regularly
I always feel gloomy
Sleep stole over us
Some day you will regret this
The wind failed us
Quarrelling spoiled our unity
Take England for example
I come from England
Sure
Anne is patiently knitting
Ann was long coming
Hasty marriage seldom succeeds
I have allergic rhinitis
That is my overcoat
Those tears are artificial
We shot our wad
Arabia abounds in oil
Not too well
Look at that cat
He is done for
I cannot abide him
Tell me what that man is like
The sisters are quite unalike
Look at those cattle
That cloud bodes rain
Look above that building
I feel sick
Pardon all but thyself
I did not want to alarm you
Try staring at yourself
You must not play
You will study
You will banish him
You believe him completely
You know who he is
You make a box
You only have to work hard
You do not have to run fast
You do run
You can understand me
You speak my language
You are singing now
Have you ever climbed Mt
Your lies pain me
You can speak English
You must study English hard
You are beautifully dressed
You can speak German
You are liable for the debt
You have two flowers
Your hair needs cutting
Your letter crossed mine
Your hands need washing
Show your photograph
I hope your plan will work out
I tell you this
You are both in the wrong
You came out of the room
I thought you were Japanese
All around is silence
There is nobody about
He persisted in his opinion
The Irishman replies
He has more lives than a cat
We are ruined
Two pictures were doubled
I would like to travel alone
This is my first flight
I met nice people
Yes
Tony had it
You are pushing matters
You be quiet
We miss our dear grandmother
Business will recover soon
The policeman barked orders
The police keep order
Do not answer hastily
Feed chickens with seeds
Art brings bread
Art is my lifework
Never judge by appearance
Abide by your promise
Marriage proposals flooded in
Wedlock is a padlock
Blood will have blood
I passed clots
Blood will tell
I have bloody stools
The moon is risen
The moonlight shone brightly
Please cease from quarreling
Speak plain truth
The dog is a faithful animal
No dogs allowed
All dogs are faithful
The dog knows black from white
A dog is sensitive to smell
Look
This is natto
To see is to believe
The outlook was negative
You look down
Clear up the cause
We need no more men at present
Fall from reality
Settle the argument soon
Do as you are told
Words cannot express it
Words stand for ideas
I have hard stools
Know who you are
The door remains closed
The trouble lay in the engine
She implored for mercy
Please leave nothing behind
This is an operator
My tongue slipped
Cut and come again
Fortune beamed on him
Happiness lies in contentment
Hiroko has charming features
I have menopausal troubles
Every imaginable means
Cultivate the wilderness
Manners make the man
Catch a signal
Black becomes you
Love sees no faults
Set off right now
Start this moment
Matters are different now
We are in the black this month
I can hardly wait
We have an English class today
Another lonely day
The lines are crossed
Turn hard left
Keep the ball rolling
The worst situation resulted
Recently he bothers me
He died lately
Stick it out
The best is behind
Mark your maximum efforts
The year stole by
A fine rain was falling
Judgment requires impartiality
Composers create music
I had a good time last evening
I flew to Osaka yesterday
About three weeks
Garbage harbors vermin
Attend to your business
Just finished it
Kids can be kids
Children require much sleep
The child counted ten
Stop acting the child
Kids really want balloons
Thought is free
Never say die
Do or die
We get on and off the bus here
We are human
We are to get married in June
We will get married in June
We cannot thank you enough
We are awaiting your answer
We had a stopover in Chicago
We are surprised at the news
We have to think over the plan
We named the dog White
We were astonished at the news
We named the cat Mimi
We got on like a house on fire
We had to do without a TV set
We have yet to know the truth
We played all together
We were sitting comfortably
We learned how to read English
We are all born mad
We are crying
We named our dog White
We clean ourselves there
We hear with ears
We require much sleep
We prepared our meals
We reached London at midnight
We went to the Tama Zoo
We slept by turns
We appreciate his difficulties
We had six guests to dinner
Speaking
Play Chopin for me
I fail to see
I have some American friends
You are everything to me
I have a friend living in Nara
This aroused my fears
Teach judo to me
Speak in my behalf
My uncle gave him a present
My camera loads easily
My watch needs mending
My boyfriend seems serious
Please see my people
My happiness depends on you
My uncle lives in New York
My profession is policemen
My appetite was large
My heart stopped beating
My life seems unreal
History is my major
My foot is small beside yours
My skin burns easily
My hair curls easily
My father drinks daily
My reply was negative
My sister lives near Yokohama
I have been to Kyoto twice
I go to Kyoto
I lend money
I believe him to be innocent
I commute to work for an hour
I have been busy for two days
I quit smoking two years ago
I think that you are to blame
I had to go to America
I like reading American novels
I had a man build me a house
I lay on my face
I adore the opera
I have lived here
I know every word on this page
I bore this trial
I bought this car at a bargain
I collected this proposal
I often go to London
I was often seized by despair
I visited Paris long ago
I want to be a sport reporter
I met a Smith at the party
I approve the suggestion
I saw the movie five times
I saw the movie on video
I favored the hypothesis
I dismissed the protest
The car overtook me
I remember the word
I saw the man enter the room
I regarded the man as an enemy
I stressed the point
I named the kitten Tama
I bet five pounds on the horse
I like the actor
I know the whole of the story
I think it true
I unwillingly undertook it
I wanted to get a lot of money
I just followed convention
I was just going to leave home
I buy a tape
I was tired from watching TV
I feel below par
I know every inch of New York
I would like to visit New York
I go to Osaka by bus
I want a personal computer
I like green peppers very much
I buy a videotape
I belong to the brass band
I want to go over to France
I met a barking dog
I was about to leave my house
I cannot swim at all
I have another friend in China
I finally got through the test
I often catch cold
I have been to London twice
I climbed Mt
Aso
I have visited Kyoto before
I have visited Paris once
I have never been to America
I have never been to Kushiro
I like English very much
I like English better
I want to study English
I like to study English
I am forbidden tobacco
I received a welcome
I answered with joy
I spent my vacation in Hakone
I lived in New York last year
I went to America last fall
I have been to Kyoto
I firmly believe
I have never been to Kyushu
I want you to come at once
I want to make you work harder
I want to improve myself
I keep a female cat
I failed to go there in time
I believe I am in the right
I am content with my job
I loved my life and my money
I did not take many photos
I cannot help laughing
I experienced horse riding
I baptize with water
I intended to succeed
I practice early rising
I was seen to break the window
I was born in Osaka
I am going to Osaka station
I walked along the main street
I refused absolutely
I must get breakfast ready
I have been to Tokyo only once
I have a few friends in Tokyo
I want many books to read
I have been here for two hours
I waited more than two hours
I was traveling in Japan
I am pregnant
I respect elderly people
I expect him to come soon
I observed him stop
I suggested that to him
I impeached his motives
I second his nomination
I have no time to write to her
I had a good opinion of her
I excited her
I told Dad about it
I use money for buying clothes
I went to America to study
I spent ten dollars on books
I study English every day
I studied like anything
I realized I was off my guard
My heart failed me
I rent a car from my friend
I came upon a friend of mine
I study English after dinner
I have two children to support
Nor am I
Nor can I
I also stopped sleeping
You are wide of the mark
I entreat your pardon
I hope you will hear me out
I myself did it
I myself saw it
Our plans went wrong
Our thinking is flexible
Our ship touched at Marseilles
We meet sometimes at the shop
We are to meet at seven
We are badly in want of water
We are eight altogether
We had a heavy fog in London
We hope that you will succeed
We are in good condition
We must be healthy
We are dependent on each other
We provide for disaster
We went on board a ship
We got on the bus at Shinjuku
We closed the discussion
We must promote sales
We lamented his death
We believe him honest
We live on rice
We talked the night away
We cooked egg dishes
The examination is approaching
I have pyorrhea
Guard against accidents
As time goes by
Time goes very swiftly
Time went quickly
Time runs on
Set the clock right
A clock stopped
Put the clock right
I must adjust my watch
I sometimes see him on TV
Explain the following
I hope to visit Nara next time
I have hemorrhoids
My ears burn
Proper praise stinks
I got the bicycle at a bargain
I wish I were a stone
He fancies himself somebody
Go about your business
Show your own business
She maintains her innocence
Please take freely
Excuse me
Bold as brass
Youth has its advantages
The weakest go to the wall
Keep your hand still
The letter was written
The operation cannot wait
Learn a trade
Magicians use deception
He lives above his means
There was nobody about
Fall has flown by
Autumn weather is changeable
Habit is second nature
The boat is lost
I have soft stools
Spring has come around
Haruko likes warm springs
The heat has relaxed
God save the Queen
The wound discharged pus
Business is declining
We must preserve birds
Little birds sing merrily
Little girls sing merrily
The boy rolled downstairs
You had best agree
All right
I have gas indigestion
It is broiling hot
Laugh and be fat
Excellent putt
Some of the crew were drowned
Steam boilers may explode
The tablets took away my pain
I ate myself sick
I have little appetite
Good for Nobuyuki
You may as well go to bed now
Time for bed
My heart quickened
The heart works slowly
Anxiety lined his face
Worries aged him rapidly
Care killed a cat
I need a new pen
The newspaper supplies news
Act your place
Prices are lower in Kobe
The oracle was fulfilled
I want something dry
Shinko is kindness itself
People differ in habits
Speak kindly to others
All shall die
All men are fallible
Man likes bright sunshine
Man has two feet
People are bustling about
People waited for buses
Everyone laughed at the story
Behave yourself in company
Man would perish
Man is insatiably curious
My labor has started
The snowstorm held on
Water is strange stuff
Standing pools gather filth
We have water enough
Water changes into steam
The tongue stings
I bleed when I make love
My grades fell greatly
The government lightened taxes
The stars twinkled
Make a wish on a starry night
I think it will be sunny
I hope it will be fine
I think it will be fine
I wonder if it will be nice
I hope it will be nice
He came to himself
Justice will assert itself
Production is turning down
I missed a period
My period is regular
Thus goes the Bible
Spirit manifested itself
Western thought is consistent
Be utterly dejected
Pass the buck
Hold the baby gently
The baby lies sleeping
Circle in red pencil
Please reply by return
Better bend than break
There is no reasoning
Much snow has fallen
Snow is falling
Over my dead body
Wars bring scars
The ship struck northward
The ship touched ground
Thanking you in anticipation
Get ready in advance
I see a red car ahead
The good die young
Certainly
He is utterly impossible
Everybody took his position
Shoot your wad
Grandfather nodded toward me
The lawsuit remains undecided
Puppets work with wires
Keep early hours
Same as usual
Do not look out of the window
Frost touched the flowers
Frost is frozen dew
The noise lessened gradually
Choose a present carefully
My son asks for the moon
Soon gotten soon spent
Winds haunt the village
No other way
Nobody else can
Much time was wasted
The sun declined westward
The sun sometimes shone
I have hot flashes
Idleness leads to failure
Idleness leads to ruin
Skip the dull chapters
The typhoon is gone
No bones broken
They sweated gallons
It snowed in Osaka
The President desires peace
Bite down on the cotton roll
Everybody demanded happiness
Nobody bore me out
Hold onto your husband
Strength in unity
The bullet penetrated him
Boys will run risks
Ladies before gentlemen
Death is preferable to shame
We shall die sooner or later
Day alternates with night
Treat a decayed tooth
Post No Bills
I got five years in prison
The town slept
It wants looking into
It was long before he knew it
The empire strikes back
Surrender to the enemy
God above helped us
The weather turned fair
The train already starts
The train jerked forward
The telephone was still
Phone me the news
We take telephone orders
Effort produces fine results
I till the earth
They subjugate the meek
Winter is gone
Winter has gone
Tokyo was really wonderful
I would like to report a theft
Naturally
Give your papers in
My head hums
My head feels heavy
His head was gray
Overwork cost her health
Animals have no reason
Do not feed the animals
Like breeds like
Virtue is its own reward
Diamond cuts diamond
Reading has its rules
Reading affords us pleasure
The bell rang suddenly
Cloudy with occasional rain
Know thyself
The two buildings adjoin
Twice two is equal to four
Both are my colleagues
The meat cuts tough
The flesh is mortal
Sunburn irritates the skin
Japan is a beautiful country
You know some Japanese
All Japan is excited
I get nervous at immigration
Even a cat may look at a king
Cats are related to tigers
Cats like fish in particular
The cat continued to mew
Age diminished his strength
Dense bushes concealed him
Farmhouses have barns
Farmers produce crops
The waves are rising
The waves are subsiding
My water broke
Basho was the greatest poet
Shoppers crowded the streets
The sales are slipping
Sales are amazingly brisk
He may well get very angry
He won the race again
It was dark when he came in
He has two daughters
He has managerial talent
He lacks moral sense
He will answer for his crimes
He has a position
He is lacking in courage
Give him rigid training
I forget to telephone him
His nagging distressed her
His concert was unreal
His joke killed me
His affection is cooling
His opinion is for the birds
His opinion is reasonable
His opinions are variable
His wish was realized at last
His diet was abstemious
His behavior was theatrical
His life ran smoothly
His existence was recognized
His strength is waning
His strength slowly declined
His powers are failing
His speech irritates me
His efforts bore fruit
He is your lover
He likes a tiger
He is human
He is honesty itself
He is the eldest
He is always expressionless
He has various knowledge
He is easily flattered
He turned over a calendar
He will doubtless be late
He never tells lies
He is from this town
He is Mr Jones
He has gone to Switzerland
He lost no time coming back
He was all chocked up about it
He put the plan into practice
He carried out the plan
He concentrated on his work
He avoided the bait
He dismissed the employee
He lives in the town
He called it unfair
He was that angry
He usually succeeded
He looked back reproachfully
He knows whatever
His knee gave
He stood aloof
He deserves our reverence
He regretted his misdeeds
He took medical advice
I suspect that he is lying
He abhorred lying
He crossed the ground
He adores the movies
He vindicated his honor
He bade us welcome
He died from wounds
He choked with rage
He never lies
He declined in health
He enjoys good health
He forfeited his health
He succumbed to authority
His study absorbs him
He expanded his research
He is almost professional
He told deliberate lies
He met with a traffic accident
He grows a mustache
He is all curiosity
He is happy
It appears that he is mistaken
He raised a finger in protest
He turns a deaf ear to me
He is a man after my own heart
He crossed me up
He answered as follows
He argued as follows
He revised his opinion
He was happy being a Jew
He fancies himself ill
He performed high duty
He exaggerated his experience
He developed his business
He avowed his beliefs
He abandoned socialism
He lives beyond his income
He earns his bread as a writer
He sat up all night
He worked out a new formula
He excels in mathematics
He did right
He is justice
He is naturally clever
He was mentally troubled
He likes Western culture
He lives in peace
He prefers the quiet
He is attention itself
He kept early hours
He does run
He accumulated his library
He disdained bribery
He retorted immediately
He yawned widely
He yawned heavily
He advanced to colonel
He is a man of great wealth
He lapsed morally
He paid double fare
He acts his age
He received much applause
He was rightly punished
He is anxious for her news
He cursed her fate
He is all nerves
He cannot be ill
He pouted with dissatisfaction
He admitted himself defeated
He revenged himself
He is untidily dressed
He was at a loss for an answer
He attained his hopes
He put aside the book
He is very clever indeed
He professed himself satisfied
His pulse beats slow
He is just a Mr Nobody
He betrayed his promises
He is supposed to be guilty
He is a man of few wants
They are mostly polite
Their conversation went on
Their argument seemed endless
Their employees live in
Their hobby is fishing
Their effort proved abortive
Their opposition broke down
Their eyes pursued him
They wanted change now
They are human
They often invent stories
They broke into laughter
They go without shoes
They decided to marry
They have mutual respect
They entered into conversation
They watched their chance
They are after happiness
They robbed my orchard
They answered in chorus
They renounced their son
They pretended ignorance
They kept silence
They attended worship
You must not shout at him
What she says may be true
I bump into her
She shall serve tea
She has great charm
She has inherent dignity
I held the umbrella over her
Her skirt fits closely
Her face became pink
Whatever she says goes
I doubt her words
She went to Ibaraki
She is human
She likes Lake Mashuu
She achieved her purpose
She was weeping alone
She entered her twenties
She answered easily
She committed false acts
She cried for joy
She laughed in amusement
She looked at me angrily
She curtained the windows
She flatly severed it
She smiled her acknowledgment
She easily flames up
She gave milk to the cat
How kind she is
She is a pianist
She wept like anything
She was deadly tired
She has good footwork
She went by the name of Bess
She is above praise
She is chattering yet
She is all nervous
She scorns liars
She ran second
She covers Wall Street
She ached for home
She looked behind
She still alleges innocence
She sat and smoked
She left for Osaka yesterday
She answered me back
She helped me morally
She left home bag and baggage
She cursed the times

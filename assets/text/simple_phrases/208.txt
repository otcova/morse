Maybe not
Peter lives with his friend
You forgot a category
Stand by me
She is taller than you
Buy a book and read it
Ask Tom
Tell Tom
Thank Tom
Get Tom to show you that
Grab a broom and help us clean
I asked Tom to pay his bill
I can do more than just cook
I did all I could
I do a lot of things
I feel a lot safer now
I feel so helpless
I got my ears pierced
I had a mental breakdown
I had it all planned
I hardly knew Tom
I hate hospital food
I have a much better idea
I hope Tom can fix it
I hope Tom can sort this out
I hope you learned your lesson
I kept the seat warm for you
I learned a valuable lesson
I refused to believe it
I said I liked it
I said thanks
I still need to talk to you
I think Tom was drunk
I think we should break up
I think you did a good job
I thought it would be fun
I thought Mary was cute
I thought Tom was there
I thought we were happy
I told you I hate that shirt
I told you what Tom said
I understand your feelings
I want to see your house
I want to work with you
I wanted to hear you say that
I wanted to impress you
I wanted to show Tom your book
I was good
I was planning on it
I was trying to be supportive
I was watching
I went for help
I wish I could see you
I wrote the note
It could get complicated
It is possible
It looks really good
It matters
It sounds healthy
It was just a lucky guess
It was never like that
It worked perfectly
Just tell me what happened
Mary loves playing with dolls
Mary wants to buy a new dress
Maybe we should keep looking
My car is out of gas
My family loved Tom
Nobody else has a chance
Nobody encouraged Tom to study
Nobody knows it but me
Please hurry
His snoring was a deal breaker
I come from the future
This looks like silk
The sea is blue
I like to sleep on my stomach
Of course we will
This sucks
I can never forget my hometown
You are a living legend
I had a cat
You had a cat
I have a cat
Put the book on the table
There are two possibilities
I wash my hands of it
It was pretty neat
That was a long time ago
That was pretty intense
The concert was a huge success
The cops know who Tom is
The party was a big success
Tom and Mary are splitting up
Tom and Mary are still married
Tom asked Mary to wait outside
Tom broke out of jail
Tom broke up with Mary today
Tom came up with a better idea
Tom could be considered lucky
Tom could sell anything
Tom died trying to rescue Mary
Tom directed me to the theater
Tom fixed it with a hammer
Tom had a crush on Mary
Tom had a really bad day
Tom had tears in his eyes
Tom has a grown daughter
Tom has lots of furniture
Tom is a geek
Tom is a little odd
Tom is in the dressing room
Tom is like a brother to me
Tom is not as tall as Mary
Tom is not my son
Tom is on the back porch
Tom is really intense
Tom is the last person in line
Tom is the person to ask
Tom is willing to try anything
I thank you for your gift
Tom left because he was sick
Tom left his office in a hurry
Tom left home in a hurry
Tom left just as I came in
Tom left the room in a hurry
Tom likes to be spontaneous
Tom lives and works in Boston
Tom may be a thief
Tom might be all right
Tom pressured me to do it
Tom rode away on his horse
Tom said he felt a bit nervous
Tom seems nice enough
Tom seems to be ignoring Mary
Tom slept in this morning
Tom slipped on a banana peel
Tom spoke highly of you
Tom still scares me
Tom visited Mary
Tom wanted to marry Mary
Tom was a good friend of mine
Tom was like a father to me
Tom was scared of something
Tom went out to get groceries
We all need to stay together
We called off the wedding
We have not yet begun to fight
We know each other
I have three younger sisters
I did not check their mail box
We were children at that time
You have to do it today
I find you attractive
I ski
They ski
The sugar canister is empty
He drove the car
Perhaps you will seek his aid
I have one green shirt
Her expression softened
I want you to sing me a song
My father manages the store
He was wearing glasses
Tom wanted some alone time
Tom wants some alone time
Tom was very nervous at first
Tom wanted some time alone
Tom needed some time alone
I rented out the guest bedroom
I repeated my name
I require your advice
I require your assistance
I resent that implication
I respect you more than anyone
I respect your opinion
I respect your talent
I reviewed the file
I revised my theory
I rewrote my report
I ripped my pants
I rubbed my feet
I run a motel
I run a small business
I run a tight ship
I run five miles a day
I run my own business
I run this place
I rushed Tom to the hospital
Tom often cuts classes
Tom seems lonely
The cherry trees are in bloom
Real life begins after coffee
Tom might be wrong

I said it was an accident
I said keep your hands up
I said lay off
I said let Tom go
I said maybe
I said my piece
I said no
I said not now
I said nothing of the kind
I said open the door
I said show me that
I said shut up
I said sit down
I said stay here
I said take it
I said take your time
I said that as a joke
I said that wrong
I said Tom looked tired
I said too much
I said turn right
I said yes
I said you could go
I said you could leave
I said you were lucky
I sat and stared at it
I sat down on the couch
I save my receipts
I saved you a seat
I saw a lot of people get hurt
I saw a lot of things that day
I saw an explosion
I saw an opportunity
I saw how Tom did it
I saw it coming

I saw you snickering
I saw you spying on Tom
I saw you staring at Tom
I saw you with Tom last Monday
I say go for it
I say what I think
I scored a goal
I searched all over for Tom
I see a future with you
I see fear in your eyes
I see how you did that
I see I have no choice
I see I was right
I see I was wrong
I see no cause for alarm
I see no need to do that
I see no need to tell Tom
I see no need to tell you
I see no other choice
I see no problem with that
I see no reason to continue
I see nothing wrong with that
I see now that I was mistaken
I see something moving
I see Tom quite often
I see we understand each other
I see what you meant
I see why Tom dumped you
I see you are awake
I see you are ready
I see you everywhere
I see you found your bag
I see you found your glasses
I see you have been practicing
I see you remember me
I see you two have met
I see your problem
I started a new diet
I seem to have overdone it
I sense that I can trust you
I sent a message to Tom
I sent Mary some flowers
I sent Tom a note
I sent Tom and Mary home
I sent Tom back home
I sent Tom home to Boston
I sent Tom out of the room
I seriously doubt it
I seriously doubt that
I set my watch ahead one hour
I share an apartment with Tom
I shot the horse
I should be able to do that
I should be done in an hour
I should be on my way
I should be resting
I should be there in an hour
I should be there right now
I should be with my family
I should be with Tom
I should call a doctor
I should call an ambulance
I should check on that
I should definitely go
I should get back upstairs
I should get going
I should get home
I should get in touch with Tom
I should get ready
I should get Tom home
I should give this to you
I should give Tom a call
I should give Tom a chance
I should go talk to Tom
I should go there
I should go to Boston
I should go to the party
I should go warn Tom
I should jot that down
I should just go home
I should make a complaint
I should never have done it
I should never have let Tom go
I should probably get going
I should probably get home
I should probably go
I should probably help Tom
I should probably take that
I should remember that
I should start dinner
I should start packing
I should stay away from here
I should study French
I should sue Tom
I should take a look
I should take this
I should take Tom with me
I should talk to Tom
I should tell Tom to try it
I signed the lease today
I simply have to know
I simply must have it
I slammed on the brakes
I sleep in the nude
I slept like a log
I slept on the couch
I smell something awful
I sold my guitar today
I solved the mystery
I solved the problem
I solved the puzzle
I sort of liked Tom
I speak a little French
I speak French and English
I speak French every day
I speak three languages
I spent a lot of time with Tom
I spent all yesterday with Tom
I spent last year in Boston

I spoke to Tom last night

I spoke with Tom today
I started thinking about Tom
I stayed at home
I stayed up working
I stayed with a friend of mine
I stepped on a nail
I still believe you cheated me

I still go there once a week
I still have friends in Boston
I still have mine
I still have my dignity
I still have my doubts
I still have them

I suppose I should be grateful
I suppose it might work
I suppose Tom told you that
I suppose we could ask Tom
I suppose we could do that
I suppose we have no choice
I suppose you have a plan
I suppose you want me to help
I sure am cold
I sure could use a cold beer
I sure do hope so
I sure hope so
I sure wish you would leave
I suspect Tom is a spy
I suspect Tom knows more
I swallowed a bug
I swear it was Tom
I take a lot of pictures
I take care of the garden
I take it all back
I take it that means yes
I take it you disagree
I take it you disapprove
I take it you got my message
I take it you know Tom
I take it you like Tom
I take it you talked to Tom
I take my job seriously
I talk in my sleep
I talk to Tom all the time
I talk to Tom more than you do
I talked to Tom on the phone
I talked Tom out of suing you
I taught Tom how to survive
I teach French to college kids
I teach third grade
I tell Tom that every day
I bumped into the window
I had a good summer vacation
I had a great vacation
I tend to agree with Tom

Money will do nothing to it
Tom often skips class
I will gladly do my duty
I regret what I said
Please tell me how you feel
Not everyone can afford a car
None of these books are useful
The order is not fixed
They say you are what you eat
Tom and Mary appear surprised

I have two cats
The bread is fresh
I work in a factory
My night was amazing
The woman is in the room
The chairs are under the tree
The apple is on the table
The house is small
The shirt is dirty
He can get the crowd dancing
I can read thoughts
To wax and wane
Tom and Mary are both asleep
Both look a little tipsy
Tom and Mary are together

Tom and Mary both look up
Tom and Mary both make faces
Tom and Mary both smiled

Everything is logical
There are two thousand books
He likes to play football
Tom likes to play soccer
Tom likes to watch soccer
He teased us without end
She took copious notes
She sounded in a jocular mood
A moon is already shining
She acknowledged her mistake
This is rather expensive
She spoke in a querulous voice
They beseeched him to stay
They are older than Tom
I am not a philologist
I want to go out with him
I want to go out with her
My name is Theresa
I love languages
He drives fast
She knows where we live
I love studying languages
Those horses are yours
Racist people are ignorant
We almost missed the train
We nearly missed the train
We just barely made the train
He is lacking in decisiveness
There is no future for her
There is nothing to do here
Help is always appreciated
Sorry for the delay
This bolt fits this nut
I promised to obey him
You need to see the doctor
Wait until I get back
I had a rough night
He had a rough night
She had a rough night
Facebook is boring
Those are very big apples
These are very big apples
Those are really big apples
Sorry
I should move
Now it is his turn
You hold my fate in your hands
This is exactly what I want
We need them
I drank some wine
Tom felt an urge to kiss Mary
Tom drives the automobile
I am Gregor
This is a secret
The ruler is short
I want ice cream
You are in my spot
Please tidy up your bedroom
He lives a miserable life
The house got painted
He painted the house
She painted the house
He can speak French
The water is not drinkable
He is schizophrenic
She is schizophrenic
His father is a bank employee
Her father is a bank employee
You want to buy a book
Nobody can know this very well
We should keep our hands clean
Of course no
Boston is a dangerous city
I live in Miami
Emily is my girlfriend
Emily needs my help
Emily is busy right now
Emily is a student
Excuse me
I need to move
The glass is empty
I see a white lion
I was in the pool yesterday
Emily is very lovely
Laurie hates school
Luke is eating his sandwich
You left the iron on
I forgot that Tom spoke French
Mary ruined her clothing

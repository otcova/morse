You will find him
Yanni was denied by his father
Yanni is aging
Yanni has his quirks
Yanni was on the pier
Yanni told Skura not to worry
Yanni went into a rage
Yanni went on with his life
Yanni was so strict
Yanni was smoking cigarettes
Yanni missed the train
Yanni drank a few beers
Yanni kept walking
Yanni ran for his life
Yanni unlocked his car
Yanni bolted back to his car
Yanni was sitting by the fire
Yanni sat by the fire
Yanni went hiking on Thursday
Yanni had to get out of there
Yanni was concerned
Yanni went back there
Algiers is quite a unique city
Yanni lived on top of a hill
Yanni took a shortcut
Yanni had his own computer
Yanni was on his computer
Yanni wore a puffy vest
Yanni handed Skura a shovel
Yanni began to dig
Yanni knew what he saw
They started without me
Yanni was taking dictation
Algeria is stable
We were walking and we fell
People have variety
I am ashamed to beg
The shoes are worn out
Fish live in the water
The milk turned sour
He will wriggle out of the fix
You go to the Chikushi river
I barely missed being struck
The logs flamed brightly
The shouting echoes loudly
Shouts of joy burst forth
The cheers swelled to a roar
The Kamo runs through Kyoto
The band sprang to life
Students are apt to waste time
Admission to students only
Each man must cast a vote
It is getting dark outdoors
The sea was truly calm
The sea is far from calm
Turtles live to a great age
The Sphinx howled with rage
The company is in deficit
We are bound to obey the law
We believe in Buddhism
We must die sooner or later
We came upon them in New York
We just got to first base
I have diarrhea
Feathers are peculiar to birds
All are happy
Because he invited me
Tom liked his job very much
It tastes very great
At last a good idea struck me
Please share my umbrella
I beg you forgive me
Germans are a frugal people
I am not the least bit worried
They are merely different
A lot of fish perished
It has become very warm
It is absolutely impossible
It is a moral question
That is a matter of degrees
That goes against my beliefs
That is not much of a problem
It is a kind of orange
It is none of your business
That is what I want to know
He died three days later
The story is full of humor
The thief admitted his guilt
The man died a few hours ago
Birds abound in the woods
The girl had flowing hair
The deer fell prey to the lion
The poet wrote many poems
The poem worked on her heart
The work cost him his life
The dog went away like a shot
Those shoes are out of date
The boat is run by the dog
The cake tastes sweet
Such ability is native to him
Georgia is his native state
Jim mastered French and German
Dew has formed on the lawn
Shakespeare is a great poet
Computers are of great use
This is the first time
These are cakes of her baking
This is between ourselves
Answer me this
This is a false bottom pan
The new shoes pinch my feet
Commit this poem to memory
This poem is too much for me
The shoes are the same size
No one dwells in this house
Help yourself to these cakes
Sydney is far from here
You find koalas in Australia
The cake was alive with ants
The shoes are made of leather
I have a strained back
Mom alone can make this cake
I have got some money
Parrots imitate human speech
You shall have a nice cake
The hare hid behind the tree
I am always ready to help you
Nobody gives me anything
Those cats are liked by her
Africa has a lot of nature
Look at that flying bird
That lake looks like the sea
You will be able to dance well
You can speak German
Your hair needs cutting
There is nobody about
It will be fine tomorrow
He is a poet or something
The moon has gone down
The dog bit me in the hand
No dogs allowed
The dog is after the fox
The dog walked backward
The dog slipped his collar
A dog is faithful
The dog bit meat off the bone
A dog is a clever animal
Black becomes you
The lines are crossed
The confusion is all over
Mr Sato called at eleven
Mr Sato is on another line
Dissolve sugar in hot water
Keep the ball rolling
A fine rain was falling
Just finished it
This cake tastes too sweet
We let the bird fly
We saw Mr Sato leave the room
We are keeping a big dog
We wear wool in winter
We bagged a wild bird
Play Chopin for me
A good idea struck me
Half of my class like dogs
My knowledge of German is poor
My car is a Toyota
My hair curls easily
I lay on my face
I am engaged in AIDS research
I chose these over the shoes
I was moved by this movie
I am not liked by this dog
I am very busy these days
I am interested in computers
I am completely out of breath
I asked for Mr Smith
I like neither of the cakes
I want to buy the dress
I remember the word
I carried the message to him
I am not concerned with it
I am suffering from a bad cold
I want a Toyota
I am quite ignorant of French
I am going to be fourteen
I was within an ace of winning
I am majoring in medicine
I am very interested in music
I could not get out
I like sweet cakes very much
I like light shoes
I am blessed with good health
I am no better than a beggar
I am going out this afternoon
I am due to speak tonight
I am proud of my pretty cat
I smell with my nose
I am proud of being a doctor
I am living with my uncle
I met a novelist and a poet
I am engaged in a new business
I like Japanese dishes
I am pregnant
I am acquainted with him
I dislike how he smiles
I supposed him to be rich
I regard him as a poet
I took him for his brother
I wait here until she comes
I am tired of hearing that
I can read Spanish with ease
I stood all the way
Please leave me alone
I am busy
It is kind of her to help me
Poetry helps to interpret life
The poet and scholar is dead
The fact is that my cat is shy
Spring has come around
Spring came on
The birds are singing merrily
We must preserve birds
Little birds sing merrily
Just take it easy
Worry turned his hair white
God is
Man is a social animal
Man is part of nature
People are bustling about
The people cried for help
Life is full of adventure
A buffalo is akin to an ox
Nothing in the world adds up
Mr Hoshino is hard to please
Justice will assert itself
Snow is falling
The snow is melted
Do not look out the window
Frost is frozen dew
My son shall do the work
No other way
Maybe she is coming
It is in a kitchen
The typhoon hit Tokyo
No one can be a poet
No parking
The birds pecked grains
Birds have a homing instinct
The bird soared above
Birds fly south in winter
Birds fly with their wings
Mud clings to my shoes
Iron and oxygen are elements
Mr Tanabe is out now
It is getting on my nerves
Come with me
I will take you there
He loves dogs above all
My hair has grown out
I agree to his marrying her
I am to meet him at ten
He is taller than his brother
Her dog has poor hearing
His home country is Germany
His poem reads as follows
His hair stood on end
I remarked on his hair style
He set up a bundle of firewood
He came back from America
He arrived earlier than usual
He is as lean as a wolf
He read physics at Oxford
He has come down in the world
He has a smattering of Greek
He plays very well
He left the door unlocked
He is a German by origin
How unlucky he is
His knee gave way
He is a poet of a sort
He had little social life
He often plays the guitar
He became a great musician
He is not a doctor
He did justice to his talent
He fells trees on the mountain
He has three elder sisters
He is not so old as my brother
He is a poet and novelist
He thinks himself a great poet
He took pride in his dog
He abandoned socialism
He is aware of the danger
He cannot swim
He is justice
He is a poet by birth
He is a Greek by birth
He is conservative to a degree
He laughed a merry laugh
They go without shoes
They wear their hair bobbed
They bound him to a pole
They made a breach in the wall
They feared being overheard
I feel kind of sorry for him
She was heard to cry
I tasted the cake she cooked
I know nothing about her
She is nothing of a poet
She is dogged by misfortune
She gave birth to a baby boy
Her time is drawing near
Do not disturb her
Her hobby is collecting stamps
Her joke fell flat
Her jokes fell flat
Her hair feels like silk
Her father is Japanese
She made his hair curl
She has a slender figure
She had her bag snatched
She shuddered with cold
She did the job with ease
She is rich but he is poor
Her hair grayed with suffering
I wonder if she is married
She is of French birth
She smarted from the insult
Grief has silvered her hair
The scene shifted to Chicago
The wind abated a little
There is a picture on the wall
Mother is making him a cake
Choose a book carefully
He has books galore
Bring your books down
Let a sleeping dog lie
I will call for it tomorrow
I am seeing a friend tomorrow
The trees comforted me

This is not cool
I know everything
I saw him three years ago
Giraffes have very long necks
You seem distant
I love math

He often helps others
I went to donate blood today
He lost face
You might not find it
You have to wait in line
My brother is an idiot
Please eat something
He got a better score than us
I was really moved by this
No one is working
South Africa is far away
You must leave
We have two kids
My wife is cooking right now
The chance is gone
All three of us are students
I was a student at that time
These shoes are too small
It was a quiet winter evening
My dad bought me books
The ice melted
No one was late

Please sit down
We disturbed him
We only have tea
Everyone loves that place

I like tennis more than soccer
This is food
Give me a toothpick
This website is very useful
Put the carrots in the pot
This flag is very beautiful
There is one way
I saw a fight
This is unfortunate
The location has changed
I left my card in the room
The doctor gave me a shot
He just arrived
I forgot what his name was
No one lives in this building
I want to cry
He has blond hair
My cat killed this mouse
He has three daughters
The pie is delicious
I love apples
Follow me into the room
Cats have nine lives
Goodbye

The room smelled of tobacco
Bring the key
He went out to eat
All the students were there

What to do is up to you
I give my word
It will be snowing tomorrow

This gift is for you
The rules should be followed
Never lose hope
The pain was terrible
I saw a star today
She baked me a cake
Meerkats live in Africa
I do not accept your excuse
I took the bus back
We sat in the front
Walls have ears
Sliding paper doors have eyes
She has a cat
This cat is white

My son does not like fried egg
The prodigal son returned home
I was having lunch
I am Death
I washed my hands
I want to talk to you outside
She knows everything
She knows what you did
These boots are expensive
He was jogging down the beach
It looks good on you
This dress looks good on you
That looks good on you
I ran out of gas
Let me check my wallet
The chicken is overcooked
He lifted her in the air
We better be going
He laughed at me
She laughed at me
I never lied to you
He exchanges money at the bank
You look good for your age
He knows too much
She knows too much
I need you to do me a favor

Remember everything
Math is hard
I was not looking at that boy
Stop looking at that girl
His cheeks were bright red
Her cheeks were bright red

Good luck with that
Pack your bags

Learning a new language is fun
Get your priorities straight

It was delicious
The fish was delicious
I lost a lot of money
Keep it simple
You need to swallow your pride
That looks interesting
He nearly got away with it
She nearly got away with it
He almost got away with it
She almost got away with it
He tried to impress her

He broke the rules
I want to find true love
Try to explain this
You need help
We are very close friends
She got mad
I just told her
I just told him
She made a scene
At the library
She made a scene about it
People will talk
Alcohol took over his life
He was not happy about it
She was not happy about it
Get on your feet
Tuck your shirt in
Spelling bees are stupid
I want to check it out
This is your lucky day
I got used to the sun
I own this man
They are visiting relatives
She repaired my umbrella
Open at page nine
It can not be avoided
I would like you to be here
I saw a hut in the distance
I knew this would happen
You are a dream
Even this one can be an idea
The curtains are closed
She was afraid to catch a cold
You seemed to like that
He seemed to like that
She seemed to like that
Stop flirting with me
Stop flirting with my sister
The place was packed
God knows why
Please translate this for me
Please translate this
It was a big one
I hate dancing
Do what he says
Do what she says
Pope Benedict XVI has resigned

He asked her out on a date
She gave me her phone number
He gave me his phone number
I was too stunned to talk
He was too stunned to talk
She was too stunned to talk
He made no effort to apologize
We went to a movie
I gave him my phone number
We left the movie early
They left the movie early
If you insist
You look perfect

You should go talk to him
She asked about you
He asked about you
Grow some balls

You owe me the truth
You owe her the truth
You owe him the truth
We were meant for each other
They were meant for each other
I love her with all my heart
I could not believe my ears
She wants me to help her
He wants me to help him
His biceps are huge
He grinned from ear to ear
Lock the doors
This was your idea
It was your idea
I ran upstairs
I am going to have a nap
The plot thickens
This is a nightmare
I need some fresh air
His father was an alcoholic
It took him three tries
Spank the bank
Planets orbit the sun
I love him with all my heart
You need to get the job done
She stole my heart
He stole my heart
You stole my heart
My mother was furious
He tore his ligament
She moved to the West Coast
He moved to the East Coast
We kept in touch
We should keep in touch
He has a heart of gold
She has a heart of gold
Try and hurry up
Your plan worked
He went for a walk
My hair is too long
They glanced at each other
Klingons have ridged foreheads
Vulcans have pointy ears
Elves have pointy ears
Vulcans have pointed ears
I need you in my life
You are such a sweetheart
You look like Harry Potter
I got up very early today
The lesson has ended
My dad speaks English well
Let me kiss you one last time
She closed her eyes
Just tell me what to do
That sounds depressing
We used to be best friends
She always seems to be smiling
I should have told you before
He should have known
My feet are killing me
He kept staring at me
I was intrigued
He was intrigued
She was intrigued
She had tears in her eyes
The girls giggled
Go ahead
I brought one just in case
The nurse wore scrubs
He looks terrific
Please be honest
Old is eldest
Keep an eye out
Be a man
I want a boyfriend
He just wants to sleep with me
She confessed her love to him
Men cry too
She met the man of her dreams
The apples are red
He slipped out the back door
I must give it to him
I want to give it to her
I have eaten the apple
You must be in love
They won the kissing contest
I like being with you
I cried on his shoulder
I thought I was going to faint
There are rats in the kitchen
My sister is so annoying
He gave her a foot massage
Boys are stupid
Girls are crazy
He is very sick
I have another remark to make
Today has been extremely lame
His story was pretty simple
God does not exist
More of everything hurt
She hired a private eye
She sees her boss as a father
I shall give this dance a miss
I want to see your boss
You look just fine
I made them myself
Everything will be okay
It kept me from reading
I have no objection
He had no objection
She had no objection
You need to work fast
We broke up
Put some clothes on
Stop playing Minecraft
Mary is very beautiful
Mary is quite attractive
Mary is very attractive
Mary is quite beautiful
This may be correct
She always cried sheerly
He made a refreshing walk
Sugar is soluble in water
It made me very happy
He lay down on his back
I bit my tongue
I was tired from the work
I was tired of the work
That is you
The couple were the same age
I helped him cross the street
I gave my weapons away
I have some cravings
Welcome to my home
He runs the fastest
I have done a good job
He speaks Chinese
A golden key opens all doors
A fallen tree blocked the way
Peel the apples or wash them
The fog began to lift
He seems angry
My car is a piece of junk
I like my coffee weak
Life is full of ambiguity
He caught a big fish
I was sick
He left after lunch
Do not threaten me
Emily is thirsty
It turned out that she was ill
I want to go skiing with her
The leaves rustle in the wind

Call your sisters
The pain has gone away
She baked cookies
She baked brownies
He baked muffins
She baked bread
She baked a ham
She baked a pie
He was ambitious
She was ambitious
He baked her a cake
She laced the cake with poison
She baked an apple pie
I baked it for you
We baked it together
I baked it this morning
We never went to see her again
She teaches yoga
He came kicking and screaming
He has mutton chops
The only sure thing is death
We just cleaned the restroom
You need to hit the gym
She rides a fixed gear bike
She rides a fixie
Fate turned against him
It might rain this afternoon
My wife is the boss at home
My husband is a good man
This is how I feel
He is thick as a brick
I have two siblings
Maria needs to go shopping
My last name is Wang
I read the entire book
Try not to eat too much
He danced while naked
He walked with his wife
I visited him recently
He arrived three days ago
The mouse ran under the bed
He went to school
We met on May Day
They delivered it door to door
I want to learn to swim
I saw him cry
He pleaded guilty
He found the water boiling
Walking is good
The boy is tired
The boy was tired
Of course I like it
The boy draws
Everyone is different
Europe is not a country
Just ignore it
He has experience in business
It was a divine intervention
He never went out
Go back home
Go back inside
Go back outside
Go do something
Go find out
Go for help
Go get coffee
Go get help
Go have fun
Go help Tom
Go home
Go make popcorn
Go now

I waited for the bus
Show me the picture
I come from America
Now it is my turn to speak
The bug has been corrected
You were confused
You knew the alphabet
You drove a truck
I wanted a jacket

I was just joking
Do not blackmail me
Those are very famous people

She really turns me on
He really turns me on
Everyone was looking at me

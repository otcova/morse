He stopped drinking alcohol
He stopped drinking
I miss this place
I have a boring job
A month has already passed
I saw some birds flying away
You got what you wanted
Friday is the end
The coin is silver
I hunt after flies
This site is all about faggots
Please give me some analgesic
This is my worst fear
I know what makes me happy
I also like writing

Go to bed
This is just wrong

You can tell him not to worry
You can tell her not to worry
This place is great
No guy has ever asked me that
I saw him before he saw me
I saw her before she saw me
They tied him to a tree
We come in peace
I will not let that happen
He must have seen me
She must have seen me
He must have seen us
She must have seen us
They must have seen us
Tom must have seen us
Hate makes man cruel
I am thin
Surprise her with a nosegay
My grammar is poor
You are too young to marry
The candles lighted the room
She worked for several hours
This ring has lost its glitter
But I just did
She can play the guitar
I have the right to criticise
Try to be yourself
There was no need to worry

It seems the only option to me
I should have listened to Mary
Brain surgery is very complex
He asked for my resignation
She asked for my resignation
She was born in Ohio

He has a big heart
Pass me the pepper grinder
I think you know why
It gets boring after a while
This sentence is funny
This sentence is sad
This sentence is boring
This sentence is too short
We need to work together
My hands began to sweat
I think I know why
I could not help smiling
Tom could not help smiling
I like the Harry Potter books
It frustrates me to no end
Life goes by pretty fast
We got married a few years ago

No one cares about me
I met Tom there
He needs a taxi
She needs a taxi
I deserve to know the truth
She deserves to know the truth
Give me that book
I really like this restaurant

I was trying to talk to you
He regretted having been lazy
Free the animals from the cage
I can bake bread
You are the woman of my dreams
You must teach it to me
It was very sudden
I study mathematics

The moon was dim
I would die for you
Everyone has been there
Everyone I know has been there
Tom put some clothes on
All medals have two faces

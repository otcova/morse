I felt my face turn red
I promise not to bite
He gave me a big smile
I teach English in high school
Your order has arrived
Your order is on the way
Your order has been shipped
You must stay out of my life
I looked her up and down
His family is rich
You have a lot to learn
Shut up and let me do it
Tax the rich
Both my cats are dead
The cat liked it
Tom has a Turkish girlfriend
Tom named his goat Cookie
Tom has a Russian girlfriend
My mother went out on errands
She was happy with her work
I make do with what I have
I know nothing of all that
We have to do some shopping

They cook a lot better than me
A fly is an insect
He comes up with funny stories
He thinks up funny stories
He makes up funny stories
Let me give you a hug
I lost my phone again
Your supervisor just called
Typhoons can be very dangerous
People seldom do that nowadays
Tom always wears sunglasses
Man is a beast
Tom seldom walks to school
Tom rarely walks to school
Tom prefers to keep to himself
Tom arrived before us
Tom arrived before we did
Tom got there before we did
Tom got there before us
He walks into the kichen
You made me what I am
I am what I am
He opened a law firm
Get married and start a family
Our leader has many virtues
Take charge of your life again
My students adore me
I held her in my arms
This is the car of the future
A man harassed Mum
She continued to remain silent
I kicked him in the nuts
Pirates never drink water
He seemed to read my mind
All respect the emperor
He was crying his eyes out
We have talked about our past
He has me in a tight spot
You stink of sweat
He spat out a lump of saliva
He ran as fast as a hare
He put a bullet in his head
She felt relieved
He quickened his pace
Agitation seized her
He kicked my ass
Our relationship was sick
We broke up for good
This affair marked me deeply
This went on from dawn to dusk
I went to work
I understand you perfectly
We are swimming in this lake
I love having a footstool
I was wrong
Please forgive me
The key was under the couch
Economics is a social science
Egypt has a lot of people
Algerians need decent jobs
Venezuela is wealthy on paper
Cuba legalized US currency
Watch the video on Algeria
Cuba pays doctors so little
Algeria is getting richer

I have to overcome this
Matthew is still being stalked
Matthew is not gonna eat you
Matthew is now fourteen
Matthew got in legal trouble
Matthew is being stalked
He gave me food for thought
We teach in the same school
The TV turned off
Matthew booked it downstairs
I want to live in peace
I wish for a normal life
I like being close to her
He laughed and winked at me
She slipped into sleep
My grandma was a wise woman
My father published comics
She was crying with joy
He was forced to confess
He was in his early forties
Please pick up the phone
Become ungovernable
The drug lord kept four hippos
I was in indescribable pain
I melted into his arms
Take some time for yourself
You deserve it
Keep me apprised
Dunno
I have no idea how he did it
No idea
No one reads long texts
No one reads the texts anyway
No one reads those texts
No one reads the texts
You have to give him his due
You have to give her her due
My son is the apple of my eye
She gave him a pleading look
I stayed behind on my own
The risk is minimal
It has to come from the heart
It was he who spoke first
She was hot and fanned herself
Your Tom is a right one
Dark times lie ahead
I was sick
Your tights have got a ladder
I wear thick tights in winter
Tom drives a dustcart
There are dark times ahead
We have a hippopotamus
Keep it to remember me

Matthew follows all the rules
The night looked so beautiful
Matthew was actually very cute
Matthew was rebellious
Matthew had no mercy on anyone
The mansion was dead silent
Matthew knew he had a problem
Matthew wanted to start afresh
She was peering at me coldly
He took my hand and shook it
These writers are famous
I painted my house white
His strength impressed me
The cats are black
Humans are dangerous animals
I was over the moon
His phone buzzed again
Investor nerves are jangling
I saw the American stamp
I miss the way you look at me
It was you who opened my eyes
He brought it to him
You have waited a long time
We need to catch up
He fell asleep watching the TV
He took my face in his hands
He grabbed me by my wrists
I foiled the team
She is tall and slim
I held back a laugh
Now we can all sleep easy
I usually sleep on the floor
I tried to sleep
I managed to sleep a little
We must not fail this time
This is why they failed
We need to play it cool
Tom thinks this is cool
Tom drives a cool car
This is such a cool place
This is such a cool feeling
That would be cool with me
It was such a cool experience
It was really a cool deal
It was cool to work there
It gets cool at night
He was out of the house

I love this cake
It means a lot
I hope I was kissing correctly
Matthew was sad to leave Linda
Matthew was hallucinating
We were finally reunited
I beat the shit out of him
She sat at the table
I intend to cut and run
I need to know where it is
I threw a punch at him
He fucked my girlfriend
Weed is legal in New York City
I hate hearing my own voice
I have a bow but no arrows
Your expectations are too high
Try lowering your expectations
The heat has relented
The heat has eased off
The heat has subsided
The heat died down
The heat subsided
I did her
My wing mirror needs adjusting
She stood fumbling for change
I was agitated and confused
This pear tastes of soap
Everything is as it was before
What an honour
A note came through our door
The ink has leaked from my pen
My fingers are all green
We pumped the tank dry
Criticism just bounces off him
He really should know better
He really ought to know better
The stench is unbearable
Watch some telly if you like
Do what you want
Call me on my home phone
Over there is the lift
I walked into the lift
Her face lost all color
People will choose you or me
They say opposites attract
I turned towards him
It goes against my principles
Our union was forbidden
Whatevs
He seemed impassive
His reasoning was watertight
It easily jumped the fence
She dressed up and went out
We thanked Tom for coming
I settled into a chair
I thought it was going to snow
I threw myself into sports
I collapsed on the floor
He was a damn good cook
I was completely out of shape
We were thick as thieves
We were inseparable
I felt on top of the world
My cat is an adamant Maoist
I put the washing machine on
I need another tin of paint
It was Christmas
We were drunk
Matthew was home for Yennayer
Matthew was also from Algeria
Matthew finally fucked off
Matthew was mentally exhausted
Matthew had a key on him
Matthew nodded knowingly
The bar was really crowded
The sound was really strange
It was a fairly cool night
Business was really slow
I punched him in the arm
I could never ask that of you
I was absolutely flabbergasted
He abruptly put down the knife
He looked at me sharply
You made me feel like shit
I brought Tom some wood
He looked up at me
I love you above all else
Volcanoes are dangerous
He struggled to stand up
She came in at that moment
A car came hurtling towards us
He was mangled by the machine
No
Tom was lying
Blood is mostly water
Please roll up your sleeve
I bumped my head
I want you to see a specialist
The doctor says Tom is better
I have a rash on my left leg
It hurts when I breathe
The water was sweet and pure
He continued staring at her
He changed his expression
I was in serious pain
Matthew ordered his coffee
Matthew got very quiet as well
Matthew was acting so strange
Matthew was rambling

Matthew was walking home
Matthew shut the curtains
Matthew peeked out the curtain
Matthew closed his eyes heart
Matthew ran into the room
Matthew opened the curtains

Matthew jumped out of bed
Matthew watched Linda sleep
It was a long journey by train
Matthew visited Algiers first
Matthew boarded the car
I was lucky to have her
Come have some fun
Matthew slowly opened the door
Matthew made a break for it
Matthew got bored and left
He kissed me intensely
The compartment was occupied
Matthew walked past
Matthew did not return
Matthew feels safe now
Matthew produced his ticket
Matthew will have to leave now
I quickly recovered
Matthew kept watch on Linda
Matthew tried to appear calm
Matthew is ready to check out
Matthew sat on a stool
Everyone else went out
Matthew returned home at night
Matthew never saw that happen
Matthew had no clue what to do
Matthew would never knock
He had a house key on him
Matthew was extremely thin
Matthew looked towards his dog
Matthew let his dog out
Matthew ran to check on Linda
Matthew was with Linda inside
Matthew tried to get up again
Matthew loves to go camping
They let Tom out
My love life sucks
It was a week before
Tom was canceled
Tom got out
Tom broke out of prison
Taiwan is a part of China
There is one China
China will invade Taiwan
This is inevitable
China will capture Taiwan
The weather became colder
It could have been even worse
She dumped me for someone else
Love is a very strong feeling
He looked down the street
That apple is still green
I lost my shoe
I savoured the sensations
I proper hate dreams sometimes
The doorbell rang
Anna answered it
The doorbell rang
Anna opened the door
The restaurant was very clean
I saw straight through her
I saw straight through him
Tom does that nearly every day
Tom told me where to find you
Tom has been sick for a month
I told Tom to be a good boy
We should kill them all
Tom was wild
I hear footsteps
I had totally forgotten
Tom has bought a new yacht
I think I can manage on my own
Winters are quite cold here
No one says that these days
Mary sets the pupils exercises
The salad counter is this way
You drive me mad
You drive me round the bend
No progress was made
No progress has been made
Tom crouched on the ground
No
Tom ate the crackers
Tom loved the crackers
Tom enjoyed the crackers
Your windshield is dirty
I was revealing my secrets
Your windscreen is dirty
Your windscreen is icy
There was lightning
Put the light on
The baby is only a month old
Tom has hardly eaten anything
I want to mop the floor
I lost one of my shoes
I pulled my hand back
He tentatively broke the ice
Go and bring her back
Beg her if necessary
He looked up to the sky
He hurried into the house
I rushed to my car
No one was hurt seriously
No one was hurt in the fire
They just want to talk to you
No one in my car was hurt
It hurts pretty bad
No women or children were hurt
Thank God nobody was hurt
Use your time wisely
My father drove me home
I got up early
It was still dark outside
All our books are on the floor
Tom found peace there
Tom was severely hurt
Tom wants us both
Children grow up really fast

Michael retold the story
The entire camp was canceled
The noises were getting closer
Michael saw Linda walk off
Michael went back to the camp
Michael turned the lamp off
No one was hurt in the attacks
No one was seriously hurt
There is a customer car park
There is parking for customers
No one other than Tom was hurt
Michael abruptly turned back
These talks bore me
Cookie sure is a chatty cat
It was so strange
He has got problems in school
I keep my problems to myself
We only have three days
I like a smooth chest
My mind started racing
My mind began to wander again

My throat suddenly was dry
Neither Tom nor Mary was hurt
That hurt a lot
Tom is hurting for money
That hurt like crazy
Tom got hurt in a fight
Tom hurt his back at work
That hurt quite a bit
Tom got hurt skateboarding
Tom is afraid of getting hurt
Tom is scared of getting hurt
We had sex
Everyone is busy with himself
Tanina had a miscarriage
We have a very tight schedule
It was a really tight finish
It was a really tight race
We were in a very tight spot
Money is tight at the moment
Mary was wearing a tight skirt
This fabric has a tight weave
Make a tight fist

Forced detransition is murder
I wanted to return the favour
This is double Dutch
I will never study Esperanto
He was about to faint
I asked him if he knew her
I have never played cricket

She controls my every movement
I was nervous as fuck
The air was warm
Anything is possible in life

A lot

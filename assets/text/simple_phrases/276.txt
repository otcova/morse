There was nothing to celebrate
The water is beginning to boil
The waiter brought me my drink
The trial will continue Monday
The treasure could be anywhere

Some customs will never change
Please read my reply carefully
Parents were invited to attend

Life has become very difficult
I think that would really hurt
I think Tom enjoyed doing that
I learned how to cook from Tom
I know only one way to do this
I helped Tom clean the kitchen
I could feel the house shaking
French is not an easy language
Everyone is concerned about it
Everyone has a signed contract
Everybody seems to be confused
Everybody is invited to attend
Both of us will have to change
Ask Tom what we should do next
A background check is required
You should write Tom a letter
You should clean up this mess
You should ask Tom to do that
You certainly deserve a break

This looks really complicated
They came to an understanding
There should be a celebration
There really is no comparison
The process has already begun
The jury found Tom not guilty
The economy continues to grow
The details are still unclear
The company continued to grow
The budget is extremely small
That would violate our policy
That would defeat the purpose
That would be somewhat ironic
That would be a wise decision
That could happen at any time
Thanks for catching the error
Some things just never change
Several things need to change
Safety is the primary concern
Parents are invited to attend
More challenges may lie ahead
Maybe you can get Tom to help
Maybe we should eat something

I wonder what this could mean
I wish everyone would go away
I was bored and I fell asleep
I want to be a French teacher
I think Tom will probably win
I saw where Tom hid his money
I lived there for three years
I like our new French teacher
I grew up eating Mexican food
I enjoy collecting rare coins
I came here today with my mom
Everything comes down to cost
Everyone knew what was coming
Everyone except Tom ate pizza
Doing that would be a mistake
Both statements could be true
All we can do is wait for Tom
Your anger is understandable
You need to drink more water
We stayed at home last night

This perception is incorrect
This could hurt our business
This always makes me chuckle
The referee blew his whistle
The policies are quite clear
The hotel is completely full
The campfire has burned down
The area looked pretty clean
The Jacksons moved to Boston
That would violate our rules
That would explain the delay
That would be almost perfect
That was completely my fault
That noise is driving me mad
Thanks for returning my call
Take control of your destiny
Somebody else could get hurt
Safety is always our concern
Not everyone was celebrating
Nobody ever calls me anymore
Nobody can compete with that
No machine could replace you
It could take a while longer
It could be too overwhelming
It can be a little confusing
I think this might be caviar
I think Tom is just confused
I skipped French class today
I plan to come back tomorrow
I personally could care less
I love being called Grandpa
I helped Tom paint the fence

The gate needs to be closed
The biggest concern is cost
The audience began to laugh
That would be very exciting
That umbrella belongs to me
Tell us about your new book
Tell Tom to quit doing that
So many things have changed
Security is still a concern
Sales will continue to grow
People are afraid of change
Nothing seems to bother Tom
No one said this would work
My grandkids live in Boston

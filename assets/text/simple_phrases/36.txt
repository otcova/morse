Ziri noticed Rima notice him
Ziri went to check with Rima
Ziri should call the cops
Ziri made Rima feel better
Ziri was sleeping in his bed
Ziri has already gone home
Ziri entered the shack
Ziri was scared to death
We go there every year
All you think about is eating
Mary is an excellent student
Tom is a yokel
The rules need to be relaxed
They starved the dogs
Your idea inspires me
I was inspired by your idea
Mary is making the beds
You attracted customers
You brought in customers
You attracted clients
You brought in clients
You were going out
You were leaving
You were on your way out
Back up and wait
I need medical help right now
I need urgent medical help
I should cancel everything
He teleported
I know she had things to do
I know she was busy
Mary needs to pee
He left and never returned
It hurts when I pee
It hurts to pee
Tom cries over everything
Tom will cry about anything
I knew I could count on Mary
We took a taxi and came
He liked you a lot
My dad had a heart attack
Tom healed them all
You should wear a jacket
I recently quit smoking
Tom is yours now
Pigs eat slop
It is not nice
I have a witness
We are still going in circles
That was my first kiss
This barn was built by Tom
This heat is killing me
Tom and Mary got a divorce
My dog is missing
My dog has run away
Tom drinks tea every day
Let me make dinner tonight
Use the fork
Love your parents
Find out what is happening
Show us how to do it
Let your children play
Prejudice is a disease
I got bitten by a snake
I was bitten by a snake
He sure knows how to eat
This is not easy for me
Geniuses make mistakes too
They could barely see anything
I made pancakes today
Call your sister
Ziri was jogging in the forest
Ziri never camps in that area
Ziri is a backpacking expert
Ziri loves relaxing in nature
Ziri hiked to a remote area
Ziri returned the greeting
Ziri took a logging road
Ziri needed some solitude
Ziri settled into his tent
Ziri made noise
Ziri was wide awake
Ziri lied silently in his tent
Ziri was making that noise
The noise ceased
The sound ceased
Ziri heard it
Ziri heard leaves rustling
Ziri decided to leave us alone
Ziri screamed in horror
Ziri got close to his car
Ziri inched closer to his car
Ziri cleaned the car
Ziri took a trip to the woods
Ziri loves camping
Ziri came home from college
Ziri was actually at school
Ziri called for help
Ziri listened to those stories
Ziri laughed at himself
Ziri started hearing footsteps
It must be that gazelle again
Ziri slept with one eye open
Ziri was joking with Rima
Ziri freaked out
Ziri ran out of the tent
Ziri sounded ridiculous
Ziri was camping in the area
Ziri looked totally ridiculous
Ziri was wearing boxers
Ziri brought Rima back
Ziri never caught the guy
Ziri loves the forest trail
Ziri can run there any time
Ziri was camping nearby
Ziri was always on his own
Ziri hesitated to talk to Rima
Ziri decided to go on his own
Ziri did some stretching
Ziri was in the shadows
Ziri was running like a robot
Ziri tasted blood in his mouth
Ziri reached the parking lot
The dark was a protection
The light switched on again
Ziri could hear the traffic
Ziri had bad intentions
The air was crisp and cool
Ziri was in a remote location
Ziri was out of the tent
Ziri took off into the woods
Ziri returned to the camp site
Ziri drifted off to sleep
Ziri was inside his tent
Ziri shushed Rima to be quiet
There was someone out there
Ziri heard branches snap
Ziri just stood there silently
Ziri was extremely exhausted
The meadow was perfectly flat
Ziri drove through the meadow
There was someone in the tent
Ziri observed the tent
Ziri felt completely on edge
Ziri left that strange area
The tent was full of backpacks
Ziri turned to leave
Ziri was in the back
Ziri came closer
Ziri touched trash just now
Ziri kept insisting
Ziri agreed to a DNA test
Ziri went with that woman
Something about Ziri is off
Ziri is just being paranoid
Ziri was happy for Rima
Ziri needs to believe it
Ziri heard Rima singing
Ziri is paying Rima well
Ziri is treating Rima nicely
Ziri lifted his shirt
It was hard to let Ziri go
Ziri could no longer sing
Ziri can speak
Ziri spotted a dolphin
Ziri started mocking Rima
Ziri let Rima use his ship
Ziri is not to be trusted
Ziri remained still
The shark swam away
Ziri eventually reached home
Ziri still wants his money
Ziri is breaking up with Rima
Ziri turned and smiled at Rima
Rima went to prom with Ziri
Ziri preferred Rima to Walid
Ziri gave Rima his room
Ziri limped down the hallway
Ziri can come live with Rima
Ziri kept rubbing his eyes
Ziri will tell Rima his story
Ziri was paying off his debts
Ziri wanted to strangle Rima
Ziri brought his dog with him
Ziri tore off his mask
Africa is for Africans
I like the color of your lips
Buy a toy for your child
Tom visited me yesterday
My shoelace broke
Follow my instructions
I saw three men chasing Tom
I saw three men beating Tom up
I saw three men attacking Tom
I never leave my house
How you treat people matters
Tom asked me for a favor
Tom asked me to do him a favor
Tom called Mary that night
I hate you all so much
The medic cauterized the wound
Tom has designed a new engine
Belynda is my little sister
We need to dig a little deeper
We all felt happy that night
Saadia is my aunt
Tom heard Mary calling him
Tom heard Mary leaving
Tom heard Mary leave
An old man approached
They always cry
Think before you jump
Let me win
I thought it would be easy
I thought this would be easier
You never know what may happen
The dog farted
Sure
Blame it on the dog
Tom found a nice flat for me
Tom found me a nice flat
She has a superiority complex
Everything is going as usual
My fridge is faulty
He just appeared from nowhere
Stop being naughty
We let ourselves down
Mary has little to say
Snow is still lying in places
War creates uncertainty
I read a book yesterday
He came fifth in the race
She came fifth in the race
His handwriting is really nice
Her handwriting is really nice
We were the first
He was the last customer
Tom works at the town museum
Your vocabulary is good
You have a good vocabulary
I feel cold without a jacket
Sit closer to me
Sit further away from me
Ziri went into the woods
Ziri was in a sleeping bag
Ziri was an overweight teen
Ziri loved hiking
The buck was grunting
The gazelle noticed Ziri
Ziri touched the gazelle
The gazelle did not move
The dog did not follow Ziri
Ziri watched the sunset
Ziri took breaks
The gazelle opened its mouth
Ziri sat there in disbelief
Ziri shouted a curse
It is a star in its prime
It is a star in its prime
The gazelle was dead
Ziri stepped carefully outside
Ziri simply drove home
Ziri wants to stay safe
Ziri was in quarantine
Ziri picked us all up
Got to go
Ziri brought his rod
Ziri went on his own
Please ring me back
We all heard the sound
Ziri was quietly talking
Mary is indecisive
Ziri was so startled
Ziri told Rima not to move
Ziri heard the voice again
He searched the bin for food
Ziri continued down the road
The bird was changing location
Everything was eerily quiet
Ziri heard the bird again
Ziri explored the beach
The landscape is vast
This area is for cattle
Ziri watched the lights
The lights moved
The lights started moving
Ziri followed the lights
The lights got closer
Ziri reached that spot
The desert gets cold at night
The lights came back slowly
The light disappeared
Ziri wanted to be left alone
Ziri was on time
Ziri was so angry
Ziri was angry as well
The sky started to turn orange
Ziri got back to the car
Ziri started the hike
It started drizzling again
Ziri set up a hammock
Ziri got settled in
Ziri got into his tent
Ziri went back to sleep
Ziri turned on his headlamp
Ziri drew his knife
Ziri stopped for a bit to rest
Ziri headed up the mountain
Ziri heard absolutely nothing
Ziri should pick up the pace
Ziri felt normal again
Ziri turned off his light
Ziri bolted back to town
Ziri readied his knife
Ziri ran back to town
Ziri went hiking at night
Ziri is addicted to hikes
Ziri is always energetic
Ziri has no hunting license
Ziri went off trail
The sheep were panicking
Ziri walked towards the pen
Ziri felt more frustrated
Ziri was on edge again
The bear stood up on two legs
Ziri tried not to look scared
The leopard looked defensive
Leopards are very territorial
Ziri started shivering
Ziri came from behind Rima
Ziri walked back to his bike
Ziri finally calmed down
Ziri loves stargazing
The stars looked wonderful
Ziri became concerned
Ziri was traveling by foot
Ziri travels by bike
Ziri immediately looked up
Ziri looked at the sky
The lights were moving so much
Ziri was a curious child
Ziri became afraid
Ziri got out to inspect
It does rain in the Sahara
Jinns are invisible
Jinns live in the desert
Jinns can talk to people
Muslims believe in jinns
People in Siwa speak Berber
The Numidian horsemen returned
Ziri pampered Rima with gifts
Ziri is pressing oil
Islam is a world religion
My father is very strict
You have to ask Tom
It is over
I want somebody to love me
Tom blew his fuse
My grandfather had a big nose
Tom is really into doing that
Tom was our platoon leader
This is a very common mistake
I had all my money stolen
All my money got stolen
I watch this movie every year
Thanks for doing your part
Two squared is four
Dad wants to see us
He came from Lagos
We are Americans
I want trousers
That was such a good show
Tom Jackson must step down
My English is not feminine
He lost his parents
Ziri took the video down
Ziri never forgets to do that
Ziri enjoyed working with Rima
Ziri got confused in the woods
Ziri made it back
Ziri waited for four minutes
Ziri inspected the camp site
Ziri tried to radio Rima again
Ziri began to get worried
Ziri ran up ahead
Ziri was on the trail
Ziri pretended to be a robot
Ziri was walking weird
Ziri continued to ignore Rima
Ziri just stared at Rima
Ziri was relieved
Another forty minutes went by
Ziri was oddly quiet
Ziri is not under arrest
Ziri found the missing person
Ziri locked the truck
Ziri unlocked the Jeep
The man was gone
The driver side door was open
Ziri will tell Rima later
Ziri got back to the station
Ziri suddenly interrupted us
Ziri is done with this
Ziri had a pepper grenade
Ziri heard shots ring out
Ziri started hiking south
It was just an antelope
Ziri went on a hike
This ended up being a bad idea
Ziri spotted a gazelle earlier
The hike was ruined
Rima saw a hyena and screamed
Ziri went into his tent
Ziri saw Rima go into her tent
Ziri had a nap there
Ziri was completely silence
Ziri was dozing off
Ziri was trying to keep watch
Ziri fell on Rima
Ziri tried to wake the kid up
Ziri tried picking the kid up
Ziri was not moving normally
Ziri came in that truck
Ziri tried to get in the truck
Ziri was bruised up
Ziri got back to camp
Ziri was taking a piss
Ziri was a weird kid
Ziri resumed his watch
The light was going on and off
The forest was silent again
Ziri got in one of the buses
Ziri made it to the camp site
Ziri began to run at Rima
Ziri quickly pulled his pistol
Ziri killed a man
Ziri is a forest ranger
Ziri carries a weapon
This story is from Ziri
Ziri began looking around
The picnic tables were broken
Ziri heard and saw nothing
Ziri went back to his vehicle
Ziri headed out into the woods
Ziri recoiled in disgust
Ziri slowly walked backwards
Ziri left to come back home
Ziri called the park director
Ziri cupped his hands
Ziri finally made it there
Ziri was still close by
Ziri brought his bear spray
Ziri was still a bit on edge
Ziri also wore a black robe
Ziri accelerated even more
Ziri was in a cult
Ziri never goes there alone
Ziri is a former Green Beret
Ziri listened to his instincts
Ziri was wearing earbuds
Tom is a multifaceted player
I like these apples
It was Tom that did that
Ziri told Rima not to worry
Ziri heard a fire siren
Ziri went on the porch
Ziri pulled up his covers
Ziri ran towards the window
Ziri froze in horror
Ziri smelt the rotting odor
Ziri looked back to the window
The creature had a spiked tail
Ziri heard that story
The Tuareg women were dancing
The camel reached the stream
He lives in the countryside
Get back in bed
The waiter screwed up my order
Two cubed is eight
I knew her pretty well
Pour the man some coffee
Pour the woman some coffee
He was starting to get upset
He was starting to get annoyed
The shirt is too tight on you
I love shrimps
Thank you
Sleep is precious
Lend me a pen
Clear up your toys
Clear your toys away
Today is a quiet day
I peel potatoes
He goes to our school
Even my nan speaks it better
He is waking up
France should leave NATO
That shocked Ziri to the core
The night has gone well
Ziri could drive
Ziri was still excited
Ziri set off to the forest
The drive to Chrea was long
Ziri drove home on Thursday
Ziri set up his tent
Ziri is not welcome here
Ziri stopped and blinked
Ziri realized Rima was correct
Ziri touched the hood
Ziri retired to his tent
Ziri rolled his window up
Silence fell over the camp
Ziri woke up again
Someone has perished
Ziri was allowed to leave
Ziri lengthened the journey
It was about four years ago
Ziri owns this land
Ziri was very interested
Ziri walked to the car
Ziri went to the cops high
Ziri went to the cops drunk
Ziri got it all wrong
Ziri got a new ID
Ziri knows who Rima is
Ziri wanted to go as well
Ziri sat in the back
Ziri was coming as well
It gets dark here at about six
Ziri had to go and see
Ziri has lost sight of Rima
The hyena cowered away
Ziri tried to cover his wound
Ziri packed up fast
Ziri got Rima to the hospital
Ziri decided to go camping
Chrea is a popular place to go
Ziri made a fire
Ziri decided to take a walk
Ziri has been staring at Rima
Rima likes it rough
Ziri still felt watched
They were all staring at Ziri
Ziri only smiled
Ziri was dazed
Ziri saw Rima standing up
Ziri caught up to Rima
Ziri had confidence in Rima
Ziri has brought his dog
The rustling continued
Ziri saw who was there
Ziri has a colorful uniform
Ziri stepped out slowly
Ziri was around four years old
Ziri quickly dozed off
Ziri crawled over to Rima
Ziri needed to go pee
Ziri did his business
Ziri walked back to the tent
Ziri always goes camping alone
Ziri was looking at the sunset
It was already getting dark
Ziri went to the camping area
Ziri set up his camp there
My back feels fine
Ziri heard a deep raspy sound
Ziri sat right up
Ziri immediately jolted up
Ziri peeked over the hill
Ziri had to do that quick
Ziri started opening the bag
Ziri went rock climbing
Ziri unzipped the tent
Ziri zipped his tent back up
Ziri was screaming for Rima
Ziri listened for a while
Ziri looked up from his pillow
Ziri fell asleep eventually
A campfire will keep you warm
Ziri has to deal with the kids
My mouth feels great
Ziri licked his lips
Pour Tom some coffee
Pour some coffee for Tom
Lend me one of your pens
Lend one of your pens to me
I hope we fly today
A black cat crossed our way
Tom wanted to study geography
This is my favorite bar
She was safe
I encourage you to participate
I hear a baby crying
I auditioned for the lead role
You have to forget her
We must understand each other
I drew a caricature of Tom
Tom drew a caricature of Mary
They took a ritual bath
Typhoid is a scary disease
Go get Tom right away
My brother has been mistreated
My brother was mistreated
The coward ran away
Hit a home run
Parties are for fun
Pencils break easily
My disease is congenital
Go ask Tom right away
Go tell Tom right away
Ziri slept in a large cabin
Ziri pretended to be asleep
It was past four am
The door to the cabin opened
There were no more footsteps
Ziri came outside
Ziri just opened the back door
Ziri got off the bed
Ziri woke everybody up
Ziri was a camp counselor
Ziri was defeated
Ziri was in a red cap
Ziri cowered in fear
Ziri actually fell asleep
Ziri went to a summer camp
Ziri was very shy
Ziri said he had no idea
It took a while to get out
The bouncing sound stopped
Ziri was hiking along a trail
Ziri was alone in a cabin
Ziri is in a cabin
Ziri felt alone
Ziri began telling the story
The area is full of woods
Ziri was a skeptic
Ziri heard a loud growl
Ziri had to put his dog down
Ziri heard an aggressive growl
Ziri was a little scared
The dog loved everyone
The dog loves everyone
The dog was never aggressive
Ziri lived there
Ziri visits Rima
Ziri grew up in a cult
Ziri wanted to keep out bugs
Ziri was crawled into a ball
Ziri picked up the drawing
Ziri handed Rima the painting
Ziri did just as Rima said
Ziri lost all his paintings
The force let Ziri go
Ziri ran over to Rima
Ziri sounded crazy
Ziri was at the rescue
Ziri left the cult
Ziri practices witchcraft
Ziri has become paranoid
This is why I hate Halloween
This took place on Halloween
It was getting darker out
Ziri went to look for Rima
Ziri had no one to go with
Ziri was too curious
Ziri looked around some more
Ziri soiled himself
Ziri hid behind a thick brush
Ziri was getting sugar high
The creature left
Ziri was a man in his forties
The wind was wicked
Ziri went back out
The lights went out for good
Ziri was wearing a long coat
Ziri flipped the switch again
Ziri got Rima out of the house
Ziri was in the bedroom
The fire never reached Ziri
Ziri misses Rima terribly
Ziri got dressed
Ziri went into the garage
The dog bolted after a gazelle
Ziri moved through the area
The jackals were out
Ziri was moving much faster
Hyenas live in these woods
Ziri walked past a house
Ziri heard that ungodly roar
Ziri left for the party
Ziri was a little bit shaken
Ziri knows a forest ranger
Ziri is feeling all better now
Ziri got out of the dark
Ziri left the light on
Ziri came out of the house
Ziri turned around quick
Ziri made it back to his house
Ziri bolted inside the house
Ziri found no footprints there
Ziri was also concerned
Ziri related the story to Rima
Ziri and Rima had great jobs
Ziri has been awakened
Ziri has not moved
Ziri attempted to flee
Ziri had to do that smartly
Ziri had to do that quietly
Ziri had to do that carefully
Ziri started firing blindly
Ziri hit one of them
Ziri scanned the room
Ziri was next to his wife
The creature came into view
Ziri received no response
I hope Ziri sees this
Ziri tried again
Ziri hoped it would work
Ziri is no longer welcome here
Ziri told the ghost to leave
Ziri felt like a hero
Ziri passed the leaving room
Ziri went back in
Ziri saw that thing
Ziri walked back to the house
Ziri has just moved
Ziri was getting pretty tired
Ziri froze in fear
Ziri has a black Lab
Ziri hated the cold
It happened when Ziri was here
A fence surrounded the house
Ziri was preparing his laundry
Ziri had a flat screen TV
Ziri began to listen
Ziri was acting like a dog
Ziri sat in his room still
Ziri was just watching TV
The creature spotted Ziri
Ziri looked freaked out
Behind that house was a forest
The knocks came in fours
Ziri was born this way
Ziri has hurt people
Ziri was raised up in that
Ziri is still sticking around
Ziri still covered his face
The car was pulling a trailer
Ziri checked on Rima again
Ziri owned the car
Ziri was unaware of the place
Ziri felt fine
Ziri looked still tired
We elected to go to Algeria
Ziri saw little white flowers
Ziri saw a leprechaun
Ziri said he saw a leprechaun
Something bit Ziri on the leg
Ziri glanced at Rima
The nurse took care of Ziri
Ziri was feeling alright
Ziri felt followed
The dread returned
Ziri made Rima go in with him
The walls were torn down
Ziri walked back downstairs
Ziri is gonna miss a thing
Ziri went up back to bed
Ziri followed Rima outside
Mary was scratched
Elon Musk invented Twitter
A bird sings as its beak grows
I solve the task
Our comrade is reading a novel
Not all men like short women
I usually sit over there
He thought he was lost
Leave the badgers alone
Cookie is purring loudly
They did so
You misunderstand me
Only six people are here
Mary only drinks chamomile tea
That makes twenty euros
Wash your face regularly
The weather is getting colder
The weather is becoming colder
Tom was drunk when he did that
Open the door
I want to get out of here
Come back tomorrow
Come and sit down to eat
Parties are supposed to be fun
Parties are meant to be fun
Bring me the book
He was nowhere to be found
I asked her to do that
That helmet saved your life
Your luck just ran out
We go to church every Sunday
There is no life on the island
I lost the key
I remember how it happened
My phone was on silent
They blamed Tom for everything
Tom was blamed for everything
Eat more fiber
This is a warning
Geniuses make mistakes as well
I tried calling Tom
Tom lost his parents
Show everyone what you drew
Dry your client with a towel
I bought this vehicle
He had nowhere to live
He had no roof over his head
Tom had nowhere to live
The battle is lost
She ignored me in the street
Come and sit next to me
Everyone likes chips
Get that thing off me
She dared never go back there
She never dared go back there
This is my favorite show
Tell me what you really think
My head is full of school
Tell me if Tom is in
Tell me if Tom is home
Tell me when Tom gets home
Let me know when Tom gets home
I like that restaurant
I say that for you
Ziri makes great videos
Ziri hiked at night
Ziri has moved
Ziri hiked every other day
Ziri only hiked by day
Ziri heard the girls leave
Ziri gathered his stuff
It was dead out there
Ziri resumed his hike
Ziri managed to make it up
Ziri decided to head back down
Ziri ran down the mountain
This is where the trails merge
Ziri told Rima to do that
Ziri stood silent for a moment
Ziri spoke for the group
Ziri was raising his voice
Ziri would have told Rima
Ziri told everyone to hurry up
Ziri lost all sight of the dog
We scattered
All of us were in shock
It only got worse from there
Ziri came back in a panic
We all said no
Ziri needs that phone
The creature was still there
Ziri got back to the house
The creature was watching us
Ziri ran back to help Rima
Ziri eventually made it back
The path leads to the tracks
Ziri ran back urgently
Ziri was quiet for a while
Whatever was in there ran away
I hope it was just an antelope
Ziri was falling asleep
Ziri loved where he lived
Ziri loves the outdoors
Ziri eventually agreed
Ziri grabbed his binoculars
Ziri was visibly shaken
Ziri started to turn around
Ziri heard a loud yell
Ziri turned to see a huge dog
Ziri will catch up to Rima
Ziri was absolutely silent
Ziri headed down to the creek
Ziri was wearing overalls
Ziri knew what he saw
Ziri explored those areas
The pond was forty feet across
The area was entirely dark
Ziri went through that tunnel
Ziri found a tree to climb up
Ziri was completely alone then
Goosebumps covered my body
Ziri had to get out of there
Ziri helped Rima locate Walid
Ziri looked just like Walid
Ziri made his way back home
Ziri stayed out overnight
Ziri woke up some time later
Ziri took out his large knife
Ziri searched the area
Ziri decided to head back home
Ziri has some back issues
Ziri made a camp fire
Everything went dead quiet
Ziri got close to his tent
Ziri went back into his tent
Ziri got back into his tent
Ziri was waiting for dawn
A yeti chased Ziri
Ziri owned a tobacco farm
Trees surrounded the pond
The cave was a mystery to Ziri
Ziri was an amateur explorer
Ziri got an eerie feeling
Not at all
Ziri nearly gagged
Ziri went for the creek
This time was a close call
Ziri smelt that same smell
Ziri grew up and moved on
Bigfoot smells awful
Ziri camps often
Day four was very normal
Ziri heard those cries
Ziri continued north
Ziri stopped for lunch
Ziri decided to pack up fast
Ziri was sitting on a log
Ziri stabbed himself
Ziri left right there and then
Ziri jogged for forty minutes
Ziri walked for four hours
Ziri heard a plane
The helicopter landed
The helicopter picked Ziri up
Satanists worship the devil
Ziri visited a satanic temple
Ziri lives incognito
Money comes in and goes out
My thoughts are with you
Tom shot at a bird
We were praised
Put away your books
The boys are here
I told Tom that story
Tom found a knife
I knew both of the boys
I know both of the boys
Tom knew that I did it
I myself wrote that letter
Tom is quite sick
The boys are in the pool
It snuck up on people
India plays cricket
My husband works in a bank
The release should be tomorrow
India is playing cricket
Fagun plays cricket
He confessed his love
Tom was threatened
You have to get in my car
We went to bed late
No one is even listening
We close in an hour
Tom is a really private person
The park is not your property
I have a dozen cats
Tom was home all alone
She is too young to go to bars
Read the footer
They ran out of gas
I have a big problem here
You have to tell her
The hotel is on the coast
I like this photo
I like this picture
Take the money and go
We have eight grandkids
We have eight granddaughters
We have eight grandsons
My father bought me a horse
This letter was written by Tom
We ought to help Tom
Tom emerged from the grave
Tom is a powerful sorcerer
That day was a black day
Tom is a classic tsundere type
She will eat it
Chlorophyll is green
Japanese is just this way
The others are coming later
A lion is stronger than a wolf
The flowers are dead
They hit the dog with a broom
This catalogue is obsolete
France is scared
They found me by mere chance
Now I know who you are
Shake well before use
Ziri unpacked his stuff
Ziri set up camp
Ziri fired off a warning shot

Elias stood up on the stage
Let me take the lead on this
He came towards me
Islam is an evil religion
His departure made me sad
I sat next to him speechless

His eyes look like fireballs
Bill me later
Things are not as they seem
Come with me to Australia
Please sing with me
I should reword that
Let me rephrase the question
One plus one is equal to two
So much of it is so good
I knew what that look meant
The thief managed to escape
I stepped out of the shower
I lift weights regularly
I take good care of my body
My son has my genes
He looked a little sad
He has zero interest in sports
Nobody told you to leave

The trial was postponed
I wonder what it is
My legs felt limp
I wrote you a sonnet
There was no reply
Thank you for your quick reply
We only got one reply
We got only one reply
There was no time to reply
I never got a reply
I got absolutely no reply
Tom was the first to reply
Tom was the first one to reply
Nobody replied
Nobody has replied yet
A reply would be helpful
Tom replied with a nod
Tom gave a prompt reply
Stop teasing each other
She was fast asleep
It can kill
It is a merciless beating
Good luck
I knew we should have a talk
He was about to get into bed
We must suffer to be beautiful

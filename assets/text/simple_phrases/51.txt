I receive disability
We frequently skip class
They took drastic measures
Start from scratch
The robbers were pros
He only wants a little love
He only wants some attention
I saw nothing more
I go to bed at sunset
I get up with the chickens
He only wants to be noticed
I hardly remember my dream
I like his mother a lot
News nowadays spreads quickly
She travels a lot for work
He was an extremely good liar
We may never find the answer
I could do much more
The content was quite thick
I like potato crisps
I like Pepsi more than Coke

You need to leave
Thank your for saving me

She is a celebrity
It is better to come earlier
Many disagree

This house is my own property
They were walking together
I enjoy listening to old songs
The past no longer returns
I walk around the house naked
I would like a window seat
This is a private chat room
This house is entirely mine
He flung a pen at the teacher
Even not doing anything at all
We should strive for peace
My nose is blocked up
My nose is blocked
That man looks Chinese
I liked him from the start
He answered without doubting
Nothing ever goes my way
Fuck you
This is my opinion
The thought itself disgusts me
Come and have a seat
I was forced to go back home
I detest having to eat quickly
A lifetime to master
Algiers is growing steadily
Algerians like to be cautious
Algerians consume more water
The towel is red and white
So you understand what I mean
I had to wait for Tom again
This beer is a little heady
Tom has a rapacious appetite
Tom is acting fiendish
You show up in my dreams a lot
The judge is unfair
Winter will arrive soon
I hate when my house is a mess
A police car sped by
I recognize the problem
We recognize the problem
I recognise the problem
I wish I would become a doctor
Scotland voted against Brexit
I wanna go to the beach
I wanna go to the bitch
He tries again and again
I did some quick sums
I did some quick maths
I grew up in this area
I grew up near here
I know all my neighbours
I was never good at maths
No one had a torch
Have forty winks on the settee
Only Tahmid can do that
Only Tahmid is able to do that
They all sing together
Everyone sings together
Friendship means a lot to me
Friendship is everything to me
Genuine friendship is uncommon
True friendships are rare
She showed me to my room
Politics is like a curse
Not all jokes are funny

Your dog looks thirsty
Tom struggled to his feet
Take each day as it comes
A storm is on its way
He decided not to reply

Tom grew up in a broken home
She said nothing more
Every day is a challenge
I demand quality work
I want a job well done
Throwing up terrifies me
He had no hopes of winning
I dislike asking for attention
I loathe begging for attention
I made my way down the street
Everyone you talk to is an ape
Tom wanted it for free
Control her
His attitude annoys me
He fired up the stove
Lots of people call me Tom
He did it out of good will
Try calling her again
He used to call me every night
Always eat healthfully
Remember to eat healthily
Never forget to eat well
The likelihood of war was low
Do the work right away
Go ahead and finish the job
Everything frightens me
The cord rotted out
He offered her a ride home
Job loss can lead to insanity
Excuse me
My neighbour is a gossip
My neighbour spreads rumours

Check your watch
You asked
You write a lot about that
Hold this open
Humans are the worst apes

It upset Tom
Tom repeated what Mary said
I know almost everyone here
Play a tune for me
Play me a tune
I got turned away
I ought to have done that
Tom sobbed again
Give me the other one
The rumours spread quickly
The test was really easy
Please put it away
Please put that away
Tom knew it was true
Tom is a snorkeller
Tom made a paper aeroplane
Tom sighed uneasily
You know I love Tom
I go there sometimes
I hope Tom was civil
I want it done quickly
I want it done right away
This is my last time
I gave my consent
Come and see me again
I hope Tom was pleased
I think I ought to go
I think I ought to leave
I think I ought to help Tom
It was a bad marriage
It was enough for Tom
Tom breathed uneasily
The truth is the truth
Tom has gone to bed early
I know where I left it
Tom looked distressed
Perhaps you were right
I wish I could get warm
You can see well enough
I meant to do that
I was there a short time
I was there for a short time
Tom lapsed into silence
I wonder if Tom is the same
It was a funny story
This is the only obstacle
I must tell somebody
I love you as much as ever
I suppose we must go on
Tom seemed not to notice
I was going over to see Tom
Tom was just a child then
Tom is paying for everything
That sounds like what I want
I think I could get a day off
I want you to let me kiss you
It was necessary to act alone
I feel exactly the same as Tom
I see marriage differently now
There was long silence
There was another long silence
Tom looked down the street
I ought to have waited
I wish you were happy
Tom shook his head hopelessly
Tom began unzipping his jacket
I suppose you want to know why
I saw Tom in the crowd
I thought you might do it
I hope Tom will forgive me
I make a very good living
I must go and see how Tom is
Tom asked me to live with him
The design is very human
The door magically opened
He was the only one who spoke
He spoke at length
I miss my daughter very much
I miss you dearly

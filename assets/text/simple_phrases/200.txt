I want to play with the snow
They were thrashed
You may take the stand
It has a leak
It has a gap
It has a flaw
It has a seepage
It has a chink
Nobody ever does anything
I want her on my jury
Yana lives in London
She is nice
Tom sometimes goes to Boston
I have a twin brother
I am a twin
I have a twin
Tom and Mary are twins
The crowd applauded
The crowd cheered
The crowd clapped
The crowd groaned
The crowd laughed
The crowd moaned
The dog barked
The dog growled
The door squeaked
The noise continued
The noise stopped
The soldier ran
The soldiers laughed

The students applauded
The students left
The students snickered
The suspect confessed
The team waited

There are conditions
There are consequences
There are discrepancies
There are limits
There are risks
There are rules
There are similarities
There are survivors
There is hope
There is more
There is nothing
There is silence
There she stands
There was music
There was nothing
There was someone
There was something
There were enough
There were survivors
There were witnesses
These are counterfeit

These are fresh
These are good
These are gorgeous
These are great
These are heavy
These are marshmallows
These are mine
These are new
These are nice
These are ours
These are perfect
These are real

They arrested me
They believe me
They built it
They called you
They felt menaced
They have escaped
They have families
They have information
They jumped me
They missed us
They want this
They wanted me
We acted in good faith
She reads nothing but fiction
I only know a few words
He gave me a fierce look
She has a nice figure
This pen has a very fine point
Grind this coffee very fine
This table has a nice finish
Wait until I finish eating
That man was fired last week
Wait until they open fire
He has very firm convictions
We had to take him by force
The door has been forced
He kept walking back and forth
It was a foul play
The air in here is foul
That man has a foul mouth
He has a heavy frame
This is a free sample
My feet are freezing
He has a very friendly smile
I just came from my house
Take a book from the shelf
I live ten miles from the city
I saw it from the window
Give me a full glass of water
That book is full of mistakes
The dress has a full skirt
I have a funny feeling
The short circuit blew a fuse
Try to do better in the future
This job has no future
We found him bound and gagged
Their loss is our gain
We have seats in the gallery
I saw through his game
He plays a good game
The car slowly gathered speed
Things are changing
Things are fine
Things are normal
Things are quieter
Things are tense
Things got heated
Things got violent
Things got worse
Things happened fast
Things look good
Think about that
Think about them
Think about this
Think about tomorrow
Think for yourself
Think happy thoughts
This changes things
This disturbs me
This explains everything
This feels good
This feels right
This feels weird
This happened before
This is humiliating
This is intolerable
This is permanent
This is remarkable
This is shocking
This looks awful
This looks bad
This looks delicious
This looks fantastic
This looks great
This looks interesting
This looks wonderful
This makes sense
This might do
This might hurt

This must stop
This one works

This stuff works
This was fun

Throw them away
Tom is paying
Tomorrow is fine
Tomorrow it starts

Use them all
Use them wisely
Use your head
Use your brain
Use your charm
Use your feet
Use your fist
Use your gun
Use your imagination
Use your key

Use your weapons
Wait a sec
Wait a while
Wait for me

Wait in here
Wait one moment
Wait out here
Wait over there
Wait right there
Wait somewhere else
Wait until dark
Wait until tomorrow
Wait until tonight
Wake the kids
Walk towards me
Walk with me
Walk with us
Wash the car
Wash the dishes
Watch and learn
Watch me now
Watch the door
Watch the prisoner
Watch them closely
Watch your head
Watch your mouth
I moved into a new apartment
The attempt failed
That dog is very gentle
He gestures when he speaks
They got him elected Mayor
Wait till I get my hat
He gets around a lot
She gets around him
Get in touch with me
Please get off the couch
I got over my cold quickly
Get it out of the house
They got to be good friends
He got off to a flying start
I got angry
I worked a bit at my computer
He has a gift for drawing
Please give me the letter
I gave my old clothes away
Please give me back my pen
Our supplies are running out
The maid gave up her job
The bridge gave way
The crowd gave way
This elastic has a lot of give
I must finish in a given time
He is given to lying
I recognized him at a glance
Welcome to Australia
The lights glare terribly
The woman glared at us
I bought a glass vase
Water glitters in the sunlight
Go slow
That chair goes in the corner
I am going to go right away
The train is sure going fast
The brandy is all gone
Whatever he says goes
Let him go hungry
In Spain they speak Spanish
You were at home yesterday
We stayed in a chalet
Wish me luck
Women frighten me
Women hate me
Women loved it
Wood is flammable
Wriggle your toes

Finish your work quickly
He betrayed my confidence
He bores everybody
He has a good accent
He left his wife
He was petting the dog
I bought it from Tom
I have to button my jacket
I ran out of money
I want to see Boston
She bought a Chinese fan
The argument became heated
The fender was badly dented
The house burned to the ground
The letter was written by hand
The lower floors are very dark
The plot develops rapidly
These blankets are very warm
They wiped out the enemy
We gave it to the man
We left four days later
We went on foot
My father works at a factory
My father works at the factory
I appeared on television once
I sang on television once
It makes me feel sick
He has a large truck
He has a big truck
The beauty of the seasons
Choose your weapon
Hold it there
Let me look
Pick that up
We are listening to the radio
Good medicine tastes bitter
The music stopped
The phone rang
They all yell
They both laugh
They both smile
Think it over
Tom looks older
Tom loves me
Tom loves you
Tom will dance
Tom will follow
Tom will hurry
Tom will last
Tom will scream
Tom will share
Tom will shoot
Tom will sing
I suffer from melancholy
He led me to financial ruin
He is quite tall
A heavy rain fell
All the benches are taken
An automobile ran over him
Ask the waitress for the menu
Business is in a mess
Do it carefully
Do it right away
Encourage him to do it
Everyone paid for his own meal
Give me a dozen oranges
Give me that iron ball
Good morning
He agreed to what they said
He always tells vulgar jokes
He approached the door
He armed himself with a pistol
He assumed full responsibility
He bent over to tie his shoe
He can hardly walk
He carried a cane
He chose them at random
He cut him short by saying no
He defeated his enemy
He did it right away
He dislikes me
He dropped out of the club
He dropped to his knees
He eats too much
He gave her a box
He gave her a diamond bracelet
He gave it to me willingly
He got ahead of me
He got very mad
He gripped my hand
He had to face the music
He has a lot of poise
He has a swelling on his head
He has become fond of sports
He has brown hair
He has too much pride
He kept the truth from us
He likes games of chance
He likes to talk of love
He lives in a very small room
He looked him up and down
He looked very tired
He looks like a millionaire
He made friends with Tom
He makes fun of everybody
He married a very young girl
He never loses his head
He pricked up his ears
He puts on airs
He reached the rank of general
He returned very late at night
He says we should go that way
He sells radios
He speaks broken French
He spoke very well
He started swearing
He stole the money
He takes everything lightly
He told a very funny joke
He told him right to his face
He took out accident insurance
He tried to choke him
He visits us now and then
He wants a glass of cold water
He was eager for news
He was in his shirt sleeves
He was lame after the fall
He was lying on the bed
He was lying on the couch
He was peeved by what you said
He was ruined by that business
He fell ill a few days ago
He wrote it hurriedly
His birthday falls on Sunday
His creditors are after him
Hold the rope tight
Hunting is forbidden now
I bet I get there before you
I caught an awful cold
I got it right by accident
I have a pebble in my shoe
I have great respect for him
I have to brush my hat
I like folk songs
I like her an awful lot
I like horse races
I need a leather briefcase
I need help with this
I need to rent a room
I second the motion
I told you that before
I usually eat meat once a day
I want a can of tomatoes
I want a low table
I want to learn that song
It cost about thirty pesos
It gets dark at five now
It was a good opportunity
It was an act of courage
It was out of his reach
Jot it down in your notebook
Leave this sheet blank
Light the candle
Look how that ball bounces
Loosen the bandage a little
My watch is five minutes fast
No one supported his motion
Nowadays coffee is scarce
People died by the hundreds
Please bathe the children
Please beat the eggs
Please heat the water
Please make my bed
Put it over there
Put this package aside
Read the article on page two
Rest your foot on that step
Send it airmail
She carried a silk purse
She fell down the stairs
She found her first gray hair
She gets tired quickly
She has a lot of gray hair
She has a small waist
She has a very quick mind
She has beautiful rosy cheeks
She has three kids
She likes to attract attention
She lives far from there
She needs a little cheering up
She turned him down
She wears her hair loose
So much noise rattles me
Some people have no patience
Some people like it
Stand the book on end
Stick to the facts
Take this junk out of here
Tell me frankly
That classroom is too small
That cloth is very rough
That news got around
That rope has to be coiled
That strong light blinds me
The baggage is insured
The balloon went up slowly
The battery has to be charged
The bullet pierced his arm
The car moved very slowly
The cavalry charged the enemy
The child is going on seven
The coal bin is full
The explanation is clear
The floods ruined the crops
The garden has a wooden fence
The letter was written in code
The lights went out
The news moved him deeply
The patient got worse
The profits were very high
The storm let up
The suit becomes him
The temperature fell
The temperature is forty below
The train began to move
The train is passed the switch
The two cars crashed
There was a dance at our club
These oranges are very sour
These pills will ease the pain
These ties are very expensive
They adopted a little girl
They agreed to it unanimously
They all applauded his success
They armed the people
They bought a basket of fruit
They came to an agreement
They caught up with us quickly
They crawled out of the cave
They crushed all resistance
They drained their glasses
They flattened his nose
They flunked him in geometry
They hit the mark three times
They hit the target
They left before we arrived
They live in the suburbs
They live on Third Avenue
They live two flights up
They loaded the truck
They made a terrible racket
They paid customs duties
They received a box of books
They rented a house
They rushed to his aid
They sat by the fireplace
They sell sporting goods
They shot him yesterday
They soon became friends
They were cracking up
This belt fits me too tightly
This bucket leaks
This is not to his liking
This makes the situation worse
This matter must be clarified
This suit is too big for me
This would embarrass anyone

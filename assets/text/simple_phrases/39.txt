Ziri was just lucky
Ziri found Rima dead
The park is not so big
Ziri was very badly hurt
Ziri was too tiny
Ziri turned in concern
Ziri walked quite a lot
Ziri went sitting with Rima
Ziri acts like a sociopath
Ziri never found the four kids
This is very easy for me
Tom needs to deal with that
We had too little time
No problem
I can sleep on the couch
That seems to be the case
I feel so old
The wheel revolves
I remember how it started
Please enjoy
I borrowed some money
I borrowed something
We hope the nightmare will end
I want to watch Greek movies
I want to watch Greek films
They saw a rat
His methods are obsolete
His methods are outdated
It stops here only on request
We live there
The lifts are out of order
The lifts are out of order
Oh
The wind became stronger
Walk to the end
He wears good shoes
She wears nice shoes
He picked up a piece of chalk
I personally killed Jesus
I hid under the desk
There is water in the glass
I will give her a pen
I work at a cram school
She met him with a smile
We worry about the future
They met us with a smile
We met each other in Bejaia
Ziri entered the wooden cabin
Ziri feels extremely depressed
Ziri worked in other parks
Ziri has his own phobias
It all seemed good at first
Ziri decided he would go pee
Ziri was being paranoid
Ziri knew he heard footsteps
Ziri tried to push Rima down
Ziri heard Rima go away
Ziri entered the forest
Ziri was lucid
Ziri tipped his head at Rima
The park never closes
Ziri asked around about Rima
Ziri had very long legs
New footprints appeared
Ziri should try praying
Ziri overthinks everything
Ziri was acting weirder
Ziri replied with nonchalance
Ziri told us something new
Ziri got down to fix the wheel
Ziri turned to his left
Ziri was working at the park
Ziri had light brown hair
Ziri looked quite pale
This confused Ziri a lot
Ziri was waiting for an answer
Ziri ran quickly towards Rima
Ziri turned pale as paper
Ziri was dressed in all black
Ziri truly knew everything
Ziri truly risked everything
Ziri started having nausea
Ziri walked for a few meters
Ziri was basically lost
Ziri got lost at night
Ziri massaged his head
Ziri was stuck in the forest
Ziri was glad it was dark
Ziri probably fell asleep
Ziri took Rima to the base
Ziri really hates being alone
Ziri needs to go to work
Ziri went to work anyways
Ziri sounds like a lunatic
Ziri was found dead up there
Ziri died on the impact
Ziri twisted in pain
Ziri hates the job
Ziri still kind of feels bad
Ziri seemed uncomfortable
Ziri can sense things
Ziri reached his truck
Ziri felt his throat going dry
Only Ziri is aware of that
Ziri took off his sunglasses
Ziri interrupted my thoughts
Ziri felt disgusted
Ziri waved and left
All the rangers should leave
This will be the last update
Ziri is done working here
Ziri decided to check on Rima
Ziri blames himself for that
Ziri started this blog
Ziri hanged himself on a tree
Ziri may look childish
Ziri is not healthy
Suicide is hard to commit
Ziri knew who made Rima do it
Ziri should have been on alert
Ziri still needed answers
Ziri stared at Rima once again
Ziri would have killed Rima
Ziri felt his heart jump
Life is not fair sometimes
Ziri made Rima even angrier
Ziri was there for Rima
Ziri will keep his promises
Ziri will help Rima heal
Ziri waved Rima goodbye
The dolphins swim with us
The Greek doctor was very nice
The two vans collided
I saw an owl at my window
Greek cooking is interesting
My dog is a Greek Shepherd
The oil comes from olives
We remembered Berber spring
They have found you
They killed me
They protected them
Many doctors have been sick
I concentrated
It entertains me
It annoys me
They robbed me
I feel sexy
Someone followed me
Somebody followed me
Nothing impresses me
You infuriate me
Reality is fake
The whole crew is on board
You seem to get on well
I liked it from the start
We drank ourselves silly
I bought a sponge from Greece
Ziri studies crop circles
Ziri works at a bigger park
The light was going off and on
Ziri had light again
Ziri got up to check things
Ziri turned off his walkman
Ziri was wearing a dark hoodie
Ziri opened his eyes again
It was there
The mosquitoes were relentless
Ziri drove a limo
Ziri lived a humble life
Ziri got closer to his father
That year was a cold one
Ziri decorated his room
Ziri replied with a smile
Ziri settled into his new room
Ziri slept in his new room
The moon was incredibly bright
Ziri stepped inside
The clawing sound stopped
Ziri brought Rima with him
Ziri was alone in the cabin
Ziri went outside to check
Crete is a big Greek island
Ziri slept better
Ziri screamed at the screen
Ziri will soon see why
Ziri exhaled
Ziri almost laughed
There was a face in the ground
Ziri stretched the pizza dough
Ziri wanted to hear more
Ziri drowned in the rapids
Rima was the only girl
Ziri stepped towards the cabin
Ziri ordered a whisky
A few other rangers came in
This really freaked us out
Ziri ended his shift early
Ziri began to take Rima home
Ziri was so bloodied
Ziri was up there
Ziri was glad Rima did that
Ziri loves nature
Ziri was replacing Rima
Ziri got very quiet
Ziri has seen the devil
Ziri paused and looked at Rima
Ziri loves these woods
Ziri loved ranger life
It happened late one night
The ranger station called in
Ziri lied to the rangers
Ziri said he saw a hyena
Ziri lived in a haunted forest
Ziri lives in Algeria
Ziri enjoyed hiking outdoors
Ziri saw the ghost for himself
Ziri was just right here
Ziri did that quite a lot
Ziri went to the rescue
Ziri heard the crying
The trees began to thin
Ziri ascended the rock
Ziri was a fully grown man
Ziri laid the baby on a rock
Ziri left without a trace
Ziri called for backup
Ziri was greatly relieved
Ziri came along with Rima
Ziri never got scared easily
Ziri made some sick bike jumps
Ziri picked up his machete
They were very tall and thin
Ziri heard a cat hissing
Ziri ran hard
Ziri was being attacked
Ziri called in animal control
Ziri was no longer alive
Ziri was lying against a tree
Ziri was just scared
Leave it at that
Ziri continues to go hiking
Ziri rides his bike at night
There were no people out
Ziri rode along the dirt path
Ziri got his flashlight out
Ziri was not right in the head
Ziri was scared away
Ziri was too scared to move
Ziri got back on his bike
The cops checked the area
Ziri saw beavers occasionally
The grass was extremely thick
Ziri should investigate
Ziri drove by the parking lot
Ziri was riding his bike
Ziri let the truck pass
Ziri kept seeing that truck
Ziri got to the park
Easy for you to say that
Ziri drove to the parking lot
Ziri rode slowly
Ziri waved in a creepy way
Ziri waved in a friendly way
The truck just drove past Ziri
A truck followed Ziri
Ziri bolted down the road
Ziri was lying on the ground
The truck was out of sight
Ziri heard the door creak open
Ziri peeked out of his blanket
The dog stopped and growled
Ziri went straight outside
The blood was attracting flies
Ziri nearly threw up
Ziri entered the pine thicket
The hyena was absolutely gone
Ziri seemed spooked
Ziri was a little creeped out
Ziri could see no one
Ziri felt there was no hope
Everything felt right again
Ziri knew the hyena was hurt
The creature was thin and pale
The creature had hollow eyes
Ziri opened fire on the hyena
Ziri made it back to town
Ziri was a veteran
Ziri looked so pale
Ziri only had that to say
Ziri got lucky
Ziri scoured the woods
None of that matters now
A fire swept through the area
Ziri went out hunting
Ziri heard Rima on the radio
Ziri immediately got chills
Ziri went hunting again
Ziri was loading his weapon
Something followed Ziri
Ziri thought nothing of that
Ziri paid no attention
Ziri likes guilting people
Ziri likes shaming people
Ziri is extremely selfish
She wants to learn
She tells you that on purpose
Tom will never stop us
She can play the harmonica
Feta cheese has a lot of salt
This is the end of the world
Tom only needed some time
It will require money
She got angry at me
He got angry at me
It broke
I owe it to her
I owe it to him
They started arguing again
You go on ahead
Not all birds can sing
This might be useful to you
They cannot do any harm
This fabric is made of cotton
It got cold yesterday
We were too late for dinner
Look at those gloomy clouds
I ran out of room on my phone
She was very mad
Please undress to the waist
I want you to come at nine
The dog only bit him
I managed to answer them all
We became friends with Jane
I learnt to get up early
I think you are wrong
She sent me to call you
Courage grows with danger
We worked so hard
Today will be a difficult day
The connection is very slow
Teach me everything
Tom cannot have known it
The boy is getting taller
We cracked up
We burst out laughing
Justice is a hoax
Prices are going up too much
I want stability in my life
It takes time to monetize
Chase your dreams
I heard that Tom died
Stop believing in me
This is all I can be
I wish I knew how to fix this
I had a sad dream
Our friendship died
Yesterday you broke the window
Ziri wanted your cooperation
Rima wanted your cooperation
She wanted your cooperation
They want your analysis
We want your analysis
They want your advice
They want your recipe
We want your help
They want your help
He called Mary
Winter continued
The exam was in two parts
Remember what you said to me
Remember what you told me
I can barely read her writing
Even mum knows
This happened every autumn
We really missed you yesterday
Summer in Buenos Aires is hot
Summer is hot in Buenos Aires
Please ask at reception
A car arrived
I wish it were all a joke
Many people were queuing
This song reminds me of Tom
I come from Canada
The world suffers a lot
But the silence of good people
Bananas are phallic
The sand is really hot
Saturday morning
I always pray for world peace
He muted me
My phone is always on mute
I want to show you too
I did what I could to help you
Actions say more than words
Search for my dream

Another woman is holding a bag
These books are boring
Give me others
His prestige is fading
I deserve to be despised
Ziri is peeling the apples
Her husband is a happy man
You eat slowly
Turkey is east of Greece
She ordered a pizza
Neither of us knows
Just thought you should know

Cash means freedom

Make sure you come on time
Cops love doughnuts

She never loved me
I knew Tom biblically
We knew each other biblically
It needs charged
The battery is just about dead
The battery needs charged

The news is always the same
You threw me for a loop there

Not everyone needs friends
Friends are overrated
She runs a lot
He runs a lot
He still runs
She still runs
He made me run
Running keeps him young
Run a little each day
My big sister runs every day
Tom tried but he failed
Words are weak
Actions are strong
She left a little while ago
This guy is disgusting
This guy is gross
You lent out a book
Lying is a different concept
Put the plane in the hangar
That book is on my desk
Call the police immediately
Society is rotting
I need to keep my hands clean
I love them all equally
My clothes became dirty
Come here
Do it over
Redo it
I made a new friend today
My nose is stuffy
It still is your turn to play
John will come with us
My parents loved you
This one is even worse
These ones are even worse
Mine is even worse
Mine are even worse
Yours is even worse
Yours are even worse

Neither you nor Mary
Passion keeps Esperanto alive

Light destroys darkness
Darkness rots earth
Earth blunts metal
Metal reflects light
Or maybe next Friday
Autumn begins in October
Six plus two is eight
Six plus two is equal to eight

This clause is null and void

Life is meant to be lived
She is the youngest between us
He only wears sports clothes

He is close to us

Our director is a Canadian
Our manager is a Canadian
Write legibly
The rats flooded the city
My mother is shopping
They blew up the ATM
Her parents are dead
I will like that
Tom saw how you did it
A child called for help
Fish was our next course
Tom will do it for you
Tom says help is on the way
Tom is one smart cookie
Tom is a smart cookie
I will visit Australia
We sat near the fire
You need to talk to Tom now
I know Tom can do this
You have no idea who I am
You better stop messaging me
I had Tom do it for me
This is a great place to live
Thank you for your donation
No one but Tom does it
Yanni was hit on the head
God will show you the way
Pray more
Pray more
This is going to help you
You need therapy
Come to the mosque tonight
Come to the mosque today
I saw how Tom did this
This is a secret you must keep
I can help Tom do this
Yanni lived a painful life
I could help Tom do it
Yanni went out for the evening
It means a great deal to me
Yanni is struggling with life
Maybe Tom should do it
It seems Tom does this
Maybe Tom should go visit Mary
Yanni had a perfect life
This year has been tough
I know Tom could do it
Tell the kids I love them
I urged Tom to do this
He lies through his teeth
Humans belong to the mammals
Your call is being forwarded
I know Tom would do it
I land on my feet
That may not happen soon
This last trick is a tough one
I hear that a lot
We might never find Tom
That would make me feel better
I heard Tom doing this
Please keep up the good work
I am glad to be back again
I believe Tom did this
Imagine how that made me feel
We talked about Tom last night
Help me carry the suitcases
These are fish
I had to talk to Tom myself
Traffic has increased here
We need to make sure Tom knows
The next test will be harder
You need to call Tom right now
That would be too much to ask
I plan to sit with Tom
I know Tom sat with Mary
I have four cats
I asked Tom to do this
Be careful what you ask for
We want a little time to plan
He dragged me into it
She put away her phone
This piano is heavy
I knew right away it was you
I caught my finger on the door
My windows are fogged up
They fined us
He loves the easy life
Maybe they should change it
I missed the bus
We went to the countryside
He screamed a lot
I watched Tom doing it
Children have fewer teeth
You like sleeping
Just shut up and come help me
Tensions are rising
Lightbulbs run on electricity
I simply added some sugar
I want to sleep a ton
I want to sleep a bunch
They prefer to stay
I really like drinking
Come to the table
He likes filming
Tom drank something
I showed him the exit
I showed him the way out
Training is really strict
That timing was almost perfect
Just bring me what I ordered
Composing poetry is an art
You can only buy it here
One can only buy it here
She dreams about an automobile
I detest money
He concisely answered me
His plan is utopic
She needs to rest
He is an expert fisherman
Tom was overwhelmed by emotion
Saddle my racehorse
Saddle my riding horse
The doors are made of bronze
That is not acceptable
She asked my permission
Drive more slowly
The groom is thirty years old
I really wanted to kiss you
She no longer knew what to do
I am very nervous today
I am studying languages
I greeted the police officer
The parents die
This is a black olive
Everyone knows about that
He is a very good musician
Talk about your favorite film
We are eating more vegetables
There is a cat on my table
Those cats are kittens
That music is very beautiful
I think I saw her there
It was a pleasure to help them
One of my shoes is here
Here is one of your gloves
This airplane is big
They are very famous here
Go by taxi
Read a book
The kitchen is full of smoke
We prefer silence
I know they will try again
The sun is hot
You will soon know
No
That is the sun
I was born in that hospital
My childhood was good
This used to be a golf course
Find out how to deal with it
I ate the last slice of bread
I left my gloves in the taxi
It was nice to meet you both
They want to steal the car
His words hit us deeply
The truth is unthikable
I asked you a question
Answer it
We all have to do that
He brought a friend
Yanni is having an affair
He is a reasonable person
We thank you for your guidance
That means a great deal to me
Being there changed my life
We should have another party
We have so much to live for
I ran without a second thought
Tom keeps bothering me
Please do what you can
He came to ask us for a loan
All dogs are good dogs
That made me laugh out loud
Come on
My previous boss was a woman
That was a big deal for me
Thank you
We appreciate it
That was a very bold move
I drink ouzo every day
He showed me many card tricks
Everyone seems to be working
Tom was supposed to help Mary
You should not go
You should not be going
It had snowed the day before
I still cannot forgive Tom
I met her the day before
Tom was sure he should do that
I lied in behalf of her
My parents expect me to study
The foxes are in their den
I do the same with them
My first boss was a woman
That almost sounds like a plan
Mary has PTSD
He painted the sitting girl
I regret doing this
She painted the sitting girl
I have ten cats
Tell me how you can help me
We found that very easy to do
That cat really likes you
Our cat really likes you
Her name is very beautiful
My son is being toilet trained
My son is being potty trained
My kid is being toilet trained
My kid is being potty trained
Try to understand my position
That ATM is out of order
We all have deadlines to meet
We just need some more time
Tom was an excellent singer
Ask him when he comes back
Nobody wants to buy this stuff
I made an account for Tom
I set up an account for Tom
They removed a kidney
They took out a kidney
She looked out the window
Put it on however you want
Mix the ingredients well
Tom gives Democrats a bad name
I showed her the exit
We imitate the same behaviors
Careful with the bleach
The potatoes are bland
Show me tangible data
The flag was raised
I always get dizzy when I fly
Sign it before sending it
Say as much as you want
She goes to our school
We have to drain it a bit
The future began
I hate him so dearly
He hurt me so bad
Yanni wanted the good life
Yanni will take it from here
Yanni was a ticking time bomb
Yanni is away from Algeria
Nobody asked me any questions
Yanni is a very strong Muslim
I just want some space
I have egg on my face
They fired him from his job
Yiddish is not Hebrew
I often sit in the back
Just leave that in your car
Not everyone can buy a house
Nobody can run faster than Tom
He was in really bad shape
He blew the house down
Everyone farts
Our problems had just begun
They wanted Tom to leave
Tom should be at home by now
It would take time to do that
This last month has been tough
Thanks
No one can run faster than Tom
You and I need to discuss this
Let me get back to work
I cried many nights
I cried for many nights
I was sharpening the knife
The nurse vaccinated me
I want Tom to be with me
There was nobody in the hall
The water in the pool is cold
It could be a serious problem
I like the smell of your hair
Classes start tomorrow morning
Hippos live in water
I can see your rubber
I suggest we go for a walk
I woke up earlier than usual
Tom did the best that he could
I just bought a new laptop
No one likes losing their hair
This is a shady garden
You can also pay in euro
I am a busy man now
The bandit shows up
Practice makes the master
These books are the best
I wonder if Tom slept with her
Get this out of your mind
We have to find the accomplice
Korean is easy
I urgently need some money
I always talk to them
You can keep your name
The snow started to melt
Tom blackmailed me
I was blackmailed by Tom
I eat eggs every morning
I cut my hair before the trip
Christmas is near
That is not a game for kids
You said that you were eating
He himself never had children
To be good is noble
And easier
I forgot my backpack somewhere
I want to call someone
All of my friends forgot me
I prefer dogs over people
I asked him how his day was
I want to buy it all
I seriously do not like kids
Tom hugged his father
He knows I know that he knows
Everything she says is true
They should arrive by noon
They ought to be here by noon
No
He was destined for greatness
Tom bought a new robe
Those two guitars look similar
I was happy to help
Tom has PTSD
Tom just turned the radio on
Tom just turned on the radio
I always put my family first
He died in an airplane crash
The sun is melting the snow
They have a big brown dog
They have an orange cat
They have a brown cat
Writing poetry is an art
Please stop messaging me
We talked with almost everyone
That was electrifying
You seem edgy today
We held our breaths
All I ate was a banana
I bought it in Australia
We both know how to drive
Both of us know how to drive
I drove to work today
Please leave the door unlocked
This pillow is too soft
All you do is eat
They are the strongest
I have to learn to play chess
I travel by metro
Nobody heard it
Charge the phone
It has to start sometime
We did what had to be done
Taste this sweet
I understand them now
I want to spend less money
Maybe we have to cook it
Remember to close the windows
His eyes revealed his fear
The factory closed yesterday
Your armpits stink
What a cold spring
The girl was in the incubator
He took it from us
She reads the letter at home
It bothers me having to go
Metal melts with the heat
Cut the meat into strips
He gets in her way at work
I want to get a lot
He prefers to travel than work
I had to lend him a shirt
You swore to me
Tom hid from me
One of your shoes is untied
He showed elegance
The kids ran into the room
He has a really bad headache
Parking is free
That parking lot is free
I have a really bad headache
Meeting Tom lifted my spirits
Yanni spends exorbitantly
Yanni saw no other way out
Yanni pushed Skura too hard
Yanni had an eagle eye
I only ate one banana
This is final
Yanni was thirsty for blood
Neither of them is pretty
Yanni is beyond suspicion
The wall has a crack in it
That artist is very popular
Tom is very embittered
Yanni was in the spotlight
Go clean the toilet
Last month was very rainy
Tom caught a small fish
You know my address
Come if you dare
Put another plate on the table
We have a guest
That artist is in high demand
Turn the radio off
Nobody came to help us
I only saw him briefly
Yanni died at the crime scene
I want something to write with
My heart belongs to England
This needs to end
Try not to drink too much
Only Tom is capable of that
I love swimming in this lake
Sunday is his day off
There was a run on the banks
It took me a while to get here
Tom has started smoking again
I was having a dream
He invited a pretty girl
I only know a little French
I wonder how you found it
This was a big deal for me
They were following him
Just sit there and be quiet
Cats have their eccentricities
No students arrived on time
Our day was incredible
Tom is pretty tan
Nobody has done it yet
There is some fish there
I named my hamster Tom Jackson
No one got arrested last night
I read the letter at home
I started already
My birthday is soon
Hand me my glasses
Teaching begins in April
Wait here until he comes back
The bridge is open for traffic
A cold wind blows
People kill people
The data supports the theory
I enjoy reading crime novels
No one will believe his story
Those are beautiful pictures
I work here
I am not a guest
There lies the problem
I live in Koenji
Now the vacation is over
The house is unoccupied
She was in handcuffs
I advise you to go home
She loves to cook food
She found a dead person
Be so kind as to let his speak
The books belong to my sister
We enjoy playing soccer
I am just visiting
I am just here to visit
The shoes are too small
I ate too much
Ask for help if you need it
We had to cancel the meeting
I took off my sweater
I took my sweater off
My laptop is being repaired
Tom fell asleep at the table
Weaving baskets is easy
The ball bounced off the wall
You should ask Tom that
Buses leave every ten minutes
I will go to Italy
Kabyle is your culture
I said not to do that
Tom wore jeans
Tom put away his phone
Get someone to read it to you
Nobody asked me for anything
Eternity lasts so long
Tom just sent me a text
I wonder where he was
Lincoln himself was taciturn
I spent all my money
We need to get together soon
This is as close as we can get
I know how to use a computer
You will dance
I have casts on both my arms
You jumped
Ears are necessary to hear
Many people need help
Tom asked for my permission
Tom was in really bad shape
Skura got life
I talked Tom into helping us
Yanni was in luck
Yanni spoke very poor Berber
Yanni could not take rejection
Yanni was in deep trouble
Yanni turned himself in
Yanni was flying into trouble
Yanni was crazy like a fox
Tardigrades are adorable
Tom has an alibi
That is kind of sad
Just grab your coat and leave
Maisie lives in Manisa
Maisie will go to Izmir
Ankara is in Turkey
That could happen here
Tom and I wear the same size
The cicada never meets the ant
I could probably help you
Tom is very tan
Tom lives in the village
He insists on his right
I wish you a good summer rest
You have a frog in your throat
I blasphemed him
This might be your own fault
I came out in a rash
We need to be more reasonable
You never wash the floor
He left a few minutes ago
No one answered him
Tom would prefer to stay
He has to learn to relax
You need to learn how to relax
Maybe I can help you do that
Tom gave the beggar some food
We live in different universes
I sent Tom a letter
Tom likes to read tabloids
I believe it
Sell it to Tom
Tom is yellow
Lies are inexcusable
Our work is never finished
You look to be an honest man
I go to Turkey tomorrow
My watch is right
Get somebody to read it to you
The cat sleeps on the couch
I am shivering with cold
This meat is raw
We may need help
Not everyone got here on time
Not everybody got here on time
I am very sad now
He married for the money
It is a prison in Denmark
All for love
It proved that he was a thief
I watch TV daily
I own three dogs
One male and two female
I looked for him all morning
I ask for your forgiveness
I take my words back
Tell me the truth
We have something for you
I love our soccer boys a lot
You shall not worry about us
My success is thanks to her
My house faces south
She enjoys Russian pop music
All of you passed the test

Tom went by bus
This painter lives in London
A cat sat on the chair
Her beauty was indescribable
You paid too much for that

Tom threw a rock at the frog
Nobody was arrested last night
I like to drink tea
Yanni miscalculated his move
Yanni is always on the run
This coat will keep you warm
We have to see Tom
No one can stand Tom
Tom is ahead
I sent a letter to Tom
Tell us how we can help
Tom will have to walk home
No one can stand against Tom
I rarely go shopping
That makes me feel really safe
Tom can go with me
You accept me for who I am
You need to keep your balance
No one except Tom survived
I can hear
Kabyle is my mother tongue
I want to live by the sea
The glasses are pretty

He is drowning
We need a backup plan
Tom has a new hat
Her concern is just for show
Tom is forced to do the work
That is just a dream
It lacks nothing
I am smaller than him
I am shorter than him
His book comes out next month
I own the book
She is a young girl your age
One should obey their parents
We should follow the rules
Helen screamed in fear
Good evening
We heard him call for help
Come as quickly as possible
Come as quickly as you can
Freud was an original thinker
I hope that you call again
Good evening
My house is on the riverbank
My house is beside the river
Penguins are strange birds
Thus he lost all of his money
My university is international
This path is very dangerous
No one but Tom survived
Let me get you a cab
They have their rights
He must stay
Tom got married recently
The choice is difficult
Tom is eating bacon and eggs
We moved away from each other
We backed away from each other
Step away from the prisoner
Have some juice and wine
My canteen is empty
My thermos is empty
Tom killed the light
Language is beautiful
Get over it

This box is a little too small
It seems nothing has happened
They said that it was urgent
You have to protect Tom
Skura is no ordinary girl
She practices typing every day
No one knows why he escaped
I miss the cool winter days
I showed him some music
My wife has a sweet tooth
Electrons like to move
We have to move on now
I eat in the company cafeteria
Few people speak Spanish there
No one can hear you here
Careful
Tom made a wrong move
Yanni showered Skura in luxury
Tom thought my idea was crazy
Tom thinks a lot of you
Just throw it in the back seat
I live close to Harvard
We have to protect Tom
I prefer singing
You are no relative to me
He treats me like a daughter
That happened just a year ago
Bye
The days get longer in spring
Yeah
Very well

He was constantly hesitating
We always argued
I take a short nap every day
Tom drowned in this lake
You could sit on that log

What size is his girlfriend
No one is allowed

There is nothing she can do
Tom found the treasure
There was a party last night
There are lots of ways to help
Tom may need some assistance
You need to protect Tom
Tom made me feel great
I looked for Tom all afternoon
Tom goes to our school
I lied for Tom
People ask this question a lot
Learning German is tough work
I should get a new backpack
He told me already
The baby was born healthy
He abuses his position
I replaced the toilet
The plant is dying
These plants are dying
This plant is dying
The governor governs
I prefer arriving early
The law prohibits it
Watch out
Your shirt is soaking wet
You were lucky to find this

Nobody sits in the front

This meat smelled awful
They behave like children
I expected more of Tom
Tom watched Mary closely
It was a lot of fun to do that
I wet myself
Thank you for taking my call
But this is obvious
All in good measure
He is one of my colleagues
She is one of my colleagues
These rocks are angular
I corrected the translation
She usually travels abroad
Tom told Mary what he did
No one cares how you feel
Politicians are clowns
You are in luck
Three halves is six quarters
They changed the meeting room
Tom may need assistance
Anybody may sit on this bench
She can speak ten languages

Just leave it on the table
How I envy you

Yanni tried to drug Skura
Yanni felt nauseated
Yanni is on his way over
Yanni went inside the home
Tom picked some apples
Yanni was high on drugs
We need to remember all this
Yanni was off the hook
Yanni was finally off the hook
Time for plan B
Yanni is pushing boundaries
Nobody is above suspicion
Yanni paid that no mind
Tom looked disheveled
Our plan was simple
That morning changed my life
Tom is alive to this day
You can do without this
You can turn off the radio now
Yanni has started pumping iron

You had it all
You look unhappy
You ought to see the doctor
Tom seems really pleased

Nobody is interested in that
No one is interested in that
Tom was running the show
No one asked me for anything
One of my tires is leaking air
Few people speak French there
Few people speak French here
The situation is horrible
Tom was with Mary all day
Tom thought for a moment
Tom enjoys walking to work
No one was arrested last night
No one will hear you
Nobody will hear you
Tom got here late last night
Perhaps I could help you
The army is in charge now
I peed myself
I read newspapers
I got an unexpected lead
People follow their lead
You seem irritated
Watch your tone of voice
Tom talked to the teacher
Tom lost his mitten
That is so much fun
These mittens are very warm

Tom seemed dangerous
We need bandages
I hope you can join us
Tom was on the pier
Tom has the answer
You need to get a job
The dog bit me
Tom fed the animals
I happened to be nearby
All we need is a little luck
Tom was a thief
I went out last night
Tom started unpacking
Tom has a handgun
I saw a fox
I forgot to enter
Tom spoke to me about you
Tom has skipped town
Their fate is still unknown
Tom just nodded yes and smiled
There is a huge need for that
He can speak Spanish very well
Yanni was a native of Algeria
Tom went to lunch
We never lock our door
Yanni flew back to Algeria
Yanni invited Skura to Algeria
Yanni got off the bus
The air is clean
We screamed
Yanni yanked the door open
Yanni looked inside his bag
Yanni heard knocking
Yanni drove past Skura
Stand back and stand by
Yanni was made fun of
Tom skipped town
Peter has brown hair
I know how to outsmart Tom
These flowers smell good
I need you to be brave
Tom rarely goes there
Only Tom has stayed there
He suddenly died
They ate caviar
We are prisoners of time
Tom had a cup of tea
I really need more time
Tom drank a few beers
He rose slowly from his chair
Tom was in the store
We all live on the same planet
Do this

One step was not enough
We may be there

Yanni had his life planned out
Yanni lives in Algeria now
Yanni now lives in Algeria

Yanni was cursing in Berber
Yanni was singing in Berber
We were last
We try hard
Tom sat on the grass
We cried
I was told to be very careful
They strive to go to the Moon
I had a fever
Wolves live in large forests
The laws of nature are immoral
You were lying to your wife
The house was yet to be built
This is all you need to know
Cut into thin strips
And then the war began
He appreciates your help
Marie eats quickly
Tom sat near the door
I got a good grade
She was overcome by giggles
She had the giggles
She may end up in prison
Moonlight flooded the room
I hear him singing
I hear her singing
I can hear him singing
I can hear her singing
The stores are open
The shops are open
Close the doors
That cake looks just as tasty
Tom has given me something
I wanted to get your opinion
The snake bit me
Not everyone has had a friend
I share her opinion
Tom heard a gun go off
The horse is in the barn
The horse has left the barn
There was no need for concern
That sounds like a fun idea
A word is like a bullet
Tom found his car keys
Tom entered the cave
Tom is in the store
Tom needs a desk
I heard Tom was sick in bed
Tom got help
I need that weapon
In Amenas is so far away

Time is life

We panicked

Yanni answered the call
Yanni went back to studying
Yanni left a message
Yanni is new to Algiers
Our teacher is quite witty
He is clumsy
My teacher is very strict
We were here
Yanni woke up to pee
Yanni was slurring his words
I speak French pretty well
I hate you
I see the sea and the river
Tom handed Mary a shovel
The nurse gave me an injection
They did it on a whim
I need to pay for that
Tom should still be there
We need to reinvent ourselves
Tom has been doing well
I have to pay for that
Come inside
I bought what you needed
Tom never had a choice
Tom is feverish
I overtook Tom
Get busy
Tom bribed the policeman
Tom and Mary took risks
Tom and Mary both took risks
This bed is hard
Julia is a little girl
Your dress is very pretty
We hate bugs
Your dress is gorgeous
Yanni hopped out of the car
Yanni tried to run Skura over
Yanni made up the whole thing
Yanni jumped back into his car
I know this game
Yanni took pity of Skura
Yanni puked up the vodka
I can help Tom do it
Yanni spoke in plain Berber
Yanni tried to calm Skura down
We got stuck
Algiers is forty minutes away
Yanni was barely breathing
The lyrics were in Berber
Yanni smiled and nodded
Yanni was obviously drunk
Your hard work is paying off
Tom wanted to buy a new phone
Practice always pays off
We made that
I still need this
I fear the worst
We saved Tom
Tom lives in downtown Boston
I have to pay you
Show Tom how to do it
We felt safe

Praise the Lord for that
Yanni got that raise
Yanni contacted the boss
Yanni has huge eyes
Skura is just the babysitter
Yanni took a step back
Yanni is a horrible person
A human life is precious to us
Life is pretty unpredictable
I made the soup
No one saw Tom do it
Either friendship or death
We love golf
I speak a few words of Cat
I loved my job
The garage door was locked
I have to wear socks
I called Tom last night

I might change my mind
Prices will be going up
I just had dinner
You do deserve it
I urged Tom to do it
Tom took care of my dog
Tom kept Mary informed
All of us are students

This toy costs a lot
Mary ploughed her land
Mary was ploughing her land
Mary worked her land
Mary was working her land
Tom hugged Mary goodbye
This story is dead boring

She was at home
He took out his fountain pen
He likes to buy notebooks
He likes buying notebooks

This was handcrafted by Tom
Always trust your instincts

It was blistering cold
I did what I wanted
I bet Tom could do it
I arrived before Tom did

I am an unimportant being
This shop is narrow
The television is brand new
Tom is playing games
They arrested the criminals
He tickles my feet
My handkerchief is blue
I borrowed the car to them
She pets the horse
The spoon is bent
I was losing
Listen to your own voice
I eat pasta with a fork
She is making the beds
The streets are calm
May peace find you

I made an appointment
Amplicons are pieces of DNA
I need a toothpick
Tom said Mary drove to Boston
I am learning Toki Pona
He is coming tonight
Tom may want to do it
Please bring me the menu
I need a highlighter
I doubt that this is true
Tomorrow will be colder
I know my future
This is an old friend of mine
I picked a daisy for Mary
Tom gave Mary some daisies
Tom gave some daisies to Mary
I met Tom one winter day
I met Tom last winter
Yanni smiled creepily at Skura
Greetings from Algeria
Yanni tried to break in
Yanni was spooked to the core
They were speaking Berber
Skura has a gigantic purse
Skura has a cluttered purse
Yanni drove out of there
Yanni has just moved in
Yannu ushered Skura out

Yanni was talking animatedly
Yanni heard the door open
Yanni got kicked out

Yanni lied down in bed again
Yanni read the book aloud
I am French and he is American
Yanni jumped backwards
This cat is gay
This tomcat is gay

These are the trousers I want
His mind wandered
They washed the dog
He ended his job
This room is frozen
She is drawing his house
He owes a lot of money
A bird flew into the room
Tom is the village idiot
Marie speaks French well
You were undressed
You were naked
I love baked potatoes
Marie is pretty
She has beautiful eyes
Cycling is a great sport
You woke up in a sweat
I looked for a suitable answer
Matisse is a famous painter
The book is on the TV
Tom promised me the world
Take off your glasses
I want to see your eyes
You should be a model
I wish I had your hair
My sister lent me a headband
Donald Trump sucks
He took the subway
He is here for people
We were fooled again
Call back later
The dog burrowed underneath it
We got nothing on him
Just hurry
Make your presence known
He can be quite petty
I lived there alone
She does everything fast
She will never forget that day
These damages are irreparable
Beer is free on Thursday
He was very lonely
She was very lonely
You say that to everyone
It took me an hour to get here
Leave a message after the tone
I was almost late
Everyone sang the refrain
He clicks his tongue
She crocheted herself a jumper
She tends to talk in riddles
I pulled a face
I ran a bath
No one lives in this house
My bike needs repairing
My bike needs mending
My bike needs to be mended
My bike needs to be repaired
It gets dark early in winter
We heard Tom shouting for help
Dogs have remarkable noses
Dogs have very good noses
Tom is selling his car
I wish I were Canadian
I like my nephew
I immediately agreed
Tom had a lot of great ideas
Love just knows the number two
I had a horrible nightmare
He treats children well
Tom pulled Mary to him
It had been snowing all week
I like my aunt
Even Satan rebukes you
I want some advice
I hate this heat
Tom said nothing else
My grandson needs eyeglasses
I hope this is a joke
Tom pushed Mary out of the car
I prefer not to go
I can talk to Tom if you want
I often visit exhibitions
We saw Tom at the airport
My pain is chronic
Warn Tom not to do it
I needed a loan
Tom promised to do it
You should help them
Tom always speaks so vulgar
I messed up again
Tom wanted to do this
Look at them
That would ruin my marriage
That would destroy my marriage
That would ruin my wedding
Try this shirt on
My father has eaten
I was the one that paid
I was behind the wheel
You are very shameless
Take your jacket with you
Too much work killed him
Working too much killed him
Excessive work killed him
We will teach Tom some manners
They were originally farmers
The wall has ears
She found it extremely scary
This job pays well
He is blackmailing you
I drove the car out
He stayed with his aunt
The berries are very sour
He went on the carpet
The party was very boring
The noise keeps getting louder
We have a lot of fun chatting
We are studying
He is friendly towards me
The battle seemed lost
The battle seemed to be lost
His health is unstable
They elected him mayor
He ate cheese and bread
She gave a sign as a farewell
She gave a sign as a goodbye
He needs to control himself
I was cooling down
He is independent
He has no pride
He is discouraged
I am her friend
I live in France
She is a superstar
I plan to live in this city
I plan to go live in this city
I have an open nature
She opened his eyes
They appear to be having fun
It seems they are having fun
Tom and Mary were injured
No crying outside
Go wash yourselves
Her intentions are pure
There is always a way out
I am trying to do my job
I despise classical music
I abhor classical music
He will do the dishes
He could only speak German
Welcome
We do not know where she is
I am glad to hear you
We ate lunch together
I ate your lemon
They are babbling
You have a grape
He screamed for joy
She screamed for joy
She is important
I hate to be late
Summer is nearing its end
He turned his head
She turned her head
He let me work in that office
Romania is a beautiful country
He pushed against the door
He smiled nervously
She smiled nervously
You need to change
You have got to change
My bike disappeared
My bicycle disappeared
Tom is thinking
He needs to come back
He needs to return
He took my wings
Get under the table
He messed it all up
I messed it all up
I totally messed it up
I completely messed it up
I messed it up completely
I know who can help
Tom hugged Mary passionately
Hope is certain
I fear the raised seat
Everybody but Tom came
I know you resent me

I like my last name
Tom is cooking today
I suspected Tom rightfully
I have a little stash
Tom glanced sideways at Mary
Nobody asked me if I wanted it
Tom probably did this
This restaurant is in Algiers

Skura opened the doors
Skura hates dogs
I never get bored

Tom will be invited
It will be easier this year

I just need a chance
Stay away from my dogs
Tom stayed for a long time
It could stay that way
Tom let me stay
I should stay home
I think I should stay home
You should stay home with Tom
Please stay right there
You need to stay sharp
I miss you so much
Tom goes to bed very early
I use laundry detergent
I knew both of them
Ask Tom how to do this

This hypothesis is unproven
The crisis was predictable
The crisis was foreseeable

Repair the tap in the kitchen
Fix the tap in the kitchen

It has backfired
It was an own goal

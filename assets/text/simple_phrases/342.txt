Send me your changes
I have no energy left
We are waiting for comments
Her eyes blazed at me
Mary is more flexible than Tom
Tom is less flexible than Mary
Mary blushed a little
I just need some fresh air
Their eyes locked for a moment
We are all alone
The fire is dying out
Stir the fire
I told you that he liked you
I told you that she liked you
The girl is in school
Mary dyed her dress red
A wolf is howling
No pun intended
There is no hope for humanity
Humans are doomed
Humankind is doomed
There is hope for humanity

That was classic
The flight number has changed
We are taxiing in the tarmac
Hail a taxi
Hail a cab
Order a couple more tons
It was implied
Your dog has spectacular hair

Just buy her flowers
Your legs are ripped
Bring a hat

I caught a trout
Prepare the meal please
Adjust your visors
March downstairs right now
I need a bath towel
This towel is sour
No wonder it tastes horrible
Time to milk the goats
I miss Paris
The butter shortage is over
There is a way
For a limited time only
Call now
No salesman will call

Your move

There are other means and ways
Trust in the process
Modern medicine is a scam
Make a left at the light
Processed meats are toxic
The strap broke
I have binoculars
Look at this snail
Such soft ears
Duck and take cover
No one has called
Hide your valuables
Our problem is the opposite
It happened two separate times
There is a fine line here
The premise is ridiculous
Eight minus four is four
Officers are responding
We are trapped at the airport
All the planes are grounded
There is no escape route
The route is cordoned off
My face is freezing
Get his glove off carefully
I broke the key in the lock

Cover up
Your elbows are dry

That was the master stroke
That solves everything
Cut this in two
I bought a new jigsaw puzzle
I broke one of your mugs
They were sentenced to death
The rebels took them away
They spared no one
I was interrogated
There was a border skirmish
Dig faster
She has the flu
Scalp wounds bleed a lot
The stars are coming out
Watch his hands closely
She went home
She had a family emergency
She has altitude sickness
Get the first aid kit out
I dropped my phone
Set up a crossfire
Flank the machine gun nest
The miners are on strike
Take the liquor away from them
His ancestors are from here
Find some clean silverware
They broke into the cabin
The cabin burned to the ground
The tent is leaking
We have a few miles of portage
There are spiders everywhere
Play it backwards
Rewind the tape
Save a potato for me
Call the press
Best coffee ever
She went to the mall

Tom only uses archaic language
Your ox is gassy
That was an understatement
I like sweet and sour soup
That cake was a load of sugar
What you did was very brave

Soup should not be flammable
Men are idiots

Tom grinned at her
Mary curled her hair
Tom pulled out his telescope
I never should have left you
Tom was sentenced to exile
Mary swallowed hard
Tom swallowed hard
She swallowed hard
Nobody had to wait
Go straight

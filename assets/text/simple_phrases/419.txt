I see great potential in Tom
He lives a carefree life
Keep your guard up
We want to stay alive
Beer is drunk cold
Thanks for being so kind
This is my little friend
I added it to my favourites
I tried not to freak out
I am a Jew
Revenge
No one seems to have an answer
We tried doing that once
Tom tried to fix the gate
We need to find a car
I lost contact with Tom
I like your flat
Tom disguised his voice
I watched it in one go
We tried to help Tom
He was born to be an engineer
Living is not thinking
Americans are uneducated
Americans are dumb
You will die in your sleep
Nothing is true
Newts are amphibians
I want to make love to you
Fuck me in the ass
Say hello to my little friend
The car has broken down
The motorbike has broken down
I do drugs
Tom tried very hard to do that
Go on until Tom says to stop
It was a promise I made to Tom
We had to put Cookie to sleep
Come in
Anger is poisonous
It was definitely on my mind
We tried to speak with Tom
Cheese is my favourite food
Cheese is my favorite food
She limped
Maria limped
We limped
The color is beautiful
The colour is beautiful
The color is nice
The colour is nice
The color is lovely
The colour is lovely
This will take an hour or so
We drank coffee after dinner
The criminal is tense
We never knew what to expect
I possess this sentence
Windmills do not work that way
Miles piles files
His shoes are small
Call the fire brigade
I love Trump
Trump is such a great guy
I will kill all of you
Welcome to Hell
You are a fucking slut
The weather forecast was wrong
I could hear the dog barking
I heard a dog barking
Tom stopped yelling
Character limit exceeded
Both sides suck
She was really mean to me
She was very harsh with me
Tom will try to manipulate you
Eat me for dinner
This sweeper is awfully loud
I have to try to find Tom
Tom snitched on me
Tom blew on me
We sat together talking
The food is excellent there
America never loses
The side of my tongue hurts
Tom has hyperthyroidism
Mary has hyperthyroidism
Children need to learn to read
I tried to persuade Tom
Tom stopped to buy beer
I know those three girls
He arrived on Tuesday
The ambulance has arrived
One cannot live without eating
Arrive as early as possible
Get there as early as possible
Get here as early as possible
She arrived very late
He arrived last Saturday
I arrived by bike
I arrived after them
They arrived before me
They arrived after me
I arrived early this morning
Now we come to our topic
This brings us to our subject
Tom arrived unannounced
We never know what to expect
A bus is coming
This should stop Tom
Mathematics was never my forte
Ziri comforted Rima softly
Ziri wanted a clean slate
Ziri set the room ablaze
Offer it to Tom
He might use it
We need to review this
Tom secured his house
She lives far from here
She lives far away
Welcome to paradise
I keep forgetting about it
Choose your character
I sold my soul to the devil
I talk when I want to talk
So now we know where we stand
Something strange happened
Something weird happened
I missed my stop again
This door leads to the balcony
Tom tried hitchhiking
He was born in Russia
Mary tried on several dresses
You have to stop doing that
Tom fixed the light switch
Today is a very beautiful day
Tom tried on the suit
That was all I could learn
I propose to simplify it
No one will be able to stop us
You keep lying
You keep telling lies
Soon you will change your tune
I had to share my joy with Tom
You should tackle it yourself
I can take on this task
Tom walked toward the shack
I used to be a nihilist
Tom can burp the alphabet
She runs every day
She is very healthy
It was a good lesson to learn
A milky way
I tried to talk Tom out of it
Pour me another one
People used to be on time
Sorry
A triangle has three angles
Happiness is a state of mind
Tom has stopped texting Mary
It seems strange to me
Promise me now
The apple is an edible fruit
I prefer action movies
It is a real problem
There was no one here but me
Tell Tom to stop right there
The coffee is waking me up
We love our job
Tom tried to call Mary again
Maria wants to continue living
Maria arrived at the hospital
My grandma loved me a lot
Stop and get your breath back
The war seemed endless
Ask Tom to walk you home
I see Tom
Read the poem again
Press Enter
She swims really fast
She swims very quickly
I see Tom
They did that on purpose
They need to have a haircut
You need to have a haircut
Today they are not coming
I will find another job
I am nothing without her
Tom runs rapidly
Now only you can save her
Tom tried to steal a car
This hat fits me perfectly
Gas prices keep going up
Tom got off at the next stop
Tom has tried doing that once
You took a nap
I took a short nap after lunch
Get ratioed
We heard him cry
Tell me about it
It is my mouth
This is my mouth
This is the song
Welcome to puberty
I have zero chance to win
I bought myself new shoes
I never meant to be a bully
He is the tallest in the class
He listens to the radio
She listens to the radio
They look like father and son
They are like father and son
Tom asked me to stop by
It smells like lemon
It tastes like lemon
It contains lemon
I will ask that
I will ask it
I put the spoons on the table
I laid the spoons on the table
I laid my cards on the table
I put my books on the table
His car broke down
The goddess exists
Tom tried knocking on the door
This is here for a reason
He came out on TV last night
Tom swims like a dog
There is a goddess
Azad forgot the sentence
His mouth filled with saliva
Her mouth filled with saliva
Tom is drooling
Tickle him so he laughs
Tom tried doing the same thing
He may get angry
I can read you loud and clear
Tom bared his soul to Mary
Be happy with your lot in life
The Westerners are crying
Tom is a cheap skate
No one will try to stop you
Your city is being bombarded
Thank you for your compliance
Some Hispanics are Jews
This suit seems very expensive
Everybody seems homeless
This world is an illusion
The curtains will go down
The illusory show will finish
Stop horsing around
I could read Tom like a book
Tom tried to shut the door
Tom is one of our neighbors
Tom lives in our neighborhood
Stop spending so much money
Owls are nocturnal creatures
Listen to your parents
Hitler committed suicide
I swim like a cow
The answer is still a mystery
Tom made excuses
The ambiguity is beautiful
Tom can do all sorts of things
Tom used to be called Mary
Tom is antifa
Mary is a lot cuter than Alice
I like you
Tom is harassing me
Resistance is futile
You will be educated
Thanks for making Tom smile
Thanks for making me laugh
Most people drink beer cold
Tom really loves chocolate
This dessert tastes good
Pee your pants
I like warm ice cream
I had no idea I was stupid
What a great day to do nothing
He was ugly
We came to a split in the cave
Thanks for the laugh
Tom tried the key in the lock
Tom tried to take a nap
I want to learn Sorani Kurdish
This is my colleague
His colleague was from Kaluga
Buckle up and enjoy the ride
Cover me
Regroup
Regroup on me
Affirmative
Enemy spotted
Need backup
Sector clear
Negative
Enemy down
Hold this position
Get in position
You are so sexy
You are hot
I love the way you are
I want to fuck you so much
I love your legs
I love your hips
I love your stomach
You are so fucking sexy
You make me so horny
Send nudes
Tom tried his best to win
She makes me hard
I have a boner
You never listen to me anymore
Kill yourself
Kill yourselves
God is dead and so are you
You are next
Just mind your own business
We stayed at another hotel
She stayed late last night
No one was sitting at the back
We tried to stay calm
The tumour seems to be benign
There seems to be no one there
No one seems to be there
Your son seems ill
Your son seems to be ill
He collapsed on the pavement
The sun is shining again today
All the pieces fit together
You wrote all these letters
Sam asked flatly
Beer is usually drunk cold
We may never know the answer
My life is full of regret
My life is full of regrets
This sort of thing has to stop
I got Tom to stop smoking
Check his vitals
I really need help
I really need some help
The cat will sleep
This woman has mental problems
A boy plays and falls down
I loved speaking French
They still have a lot to learn
I smiled and waved at Tom
I think Tom is a good man
That horse belongs to Tom
Tom got hurt playing rugby
Always fasten your seatbelt
Maybe you should learn to read
She loves old fairy tales
It would give people ideas
Tom deflected my question
Maybe I should grow a beard
Knowing this is important
I like cheese for breakfast
Bring me my petticoat
Tom is unique
You are unique
I need a female interpreter
I used to do drugs
He could be telling the truth
She feels uneasy
We tried to outrun the bear
Tom tried to conceal his fear
They went in search of Tom
This food is unhygienic
I read all her books
I read all his books
I read all of her books
I read all of his books
Tom has stopped gambling
I want whisky
I eat one bean
I want some whisky
Tom is out looking for a job

Tom counted on Mary to do that
Tom just hired Mary
Tom was beside Mary
We need to talk with you
We need to get back home
We need to get this done
We need to know for sure
We need to get groceries
Mary tried on a dress
Tom is truly very bright
Tom headed towards the exit
I want some whiskey
This is no way to treat people
Socks are feet pants
We love our jobs
Australia is now my home
Spiders can have arachnophobia
Monday is a good day for that
Tom depended on Mary
Tom did that to Mary
Tom got to know Mary
Tom was chasing Mary
Tom was hugging Mary
Tom already paid Mary
Tom has already paid Mary
Tom stood up for Mary
Tom almost kissed Mary
That was far from my mind
Tom tried to figure it out
Stop this music
We all put on our seat belts
Tom is still stalking Mary
Ziri has no living family
They are like conlangs
We stopped dead in our tracks
Do it tactfully
No one is dead
To understand is to forgive
Tom seems to be ready to learn
I like your way of talking
I left the group by mistake
You are not alone
I am here with you
Three plus two is six
My math error is on purpose
You look sick
I love birds
Get lost
Tom rose up
We all would agree with that
Tom wants to try that again
Good boy
I think Tom has lost his mind
Grab a cart
I have a big Johnson
I have a big penis
I have a big cock
I have a big dick
I have a big banana
I have a big joystick
I have a small dick
Call me if you learn anything
You seem very pessimistic
Nothing here is left to chance
Her mind seems to be elsewhere
It might not even be necessary
We showed him the door
We ushered him out
Mary is in his good books
Stick around
Maybe you should learn French
We had to learn to be a team
A group of horsemen rode up
I made spaghetti for supper
Tom headed toward the exit
You should also learn French
That was a very lucky guess
Try it today
Maybe you dreamed it
Wake up early tomorrow
Stop being so childish
Turn on your fog lights
Give your mother my best
Get straight to the point
Let that be a lesson to you
Come with us
Her jealousy kills me
Tom tried to leave Mary
Ziri spoke in broken Berber
Ziri saw Rima in her underwear
Ziri was driving a silver car
Ziri was crossing the bridge
Stop talking so fast
Ziri was a little off
Ziri and Rima met eyes
Ziri had severe autism
The road clear off
Tom has lost his eraser
Ziri needed to act fast
Ziri is just being a father
Ziri decided to make a move
Ziri said that in a firm tone
Squirrels love birdseed
They drugged me
Someone stole my purse
It sounds like a real treat
This has a fair price
This is fairly priced
This house is yours
It can be done
No problem
I want a better price on this
Tom should stop smoking
Mary never argues with me
There are some advantages
Eat like this
Tom tried to write a novel
My hands are freezing
The tea was barely warm
This is our only chance to win
Your language is not sober
Here we go now
Please stay on the line
Please hold
He did us a disservice
The desk looks tidy
Someone might have helped her
The windows must remain closed
The windows need to stay shut
Prices are rising every day
The result was rather modest
Ali was credited with the goal
Your advert will appear here
We plan to stay for a week
A storm seems to be brewing
Looks as if a storm is coming
His jokes fell flat
We should decide that soon
He felt as if he was floating
He did her a good turn
He did her a favour
He was doing her a good turn
He was doing her a favour
The moon is shining tonight
The moon is out tonight
His parents run a hotel
We wrote the report
He stayed awake at night
He would stay awake at night
This typewriter is too old
He stayed in bed
I really love flowers
They said it was a rush job
Maybe
Nothing will stand in our way
Others seemed to agree
I told Tom to try it
Come and support a good cause
Tom tried to fool everyone
That brings to mind a question
The truck ran a stop sign
Tom never changes his mind
Tom just smiled at Mary
Tom is here to speak to Mary
Tom is counting on Mary
My hands are tied
Please pay attention to me
Tom tried his best to be happy
I like to support good causes
Tom fixed the stove for Mary
Tom probably tried doing that
Tom tried to unclog the sink
You can stop doing that now
I really appreciate that
Tom probably tried to do that
All the eggs are in one basket
I sense that you are religious
We value your privacy
I want to grow a mustache
It will be possible
You feel discouraged
I know
Ziri got his tonsils out
Ziri drops people off there
One of you has to get out
Tom only tried doing that once
Tom was smitten by Mary
Tom repeated his request
Tom is here to talk to Mary
The least we can do is listen
Tom gave Mary the book
That was a real treat
Tom has to stop that now
We had to put a stop to that
We must stop that madman
Tom tried calling Mary again
I know Tom is going to do that
I can feel it in my bones
We were all fit to be tied
Tom tried to close the door
Grapes are like eggs
I sent you some more exercises
We climbed the highest hill
I have become an old wreck
I feel like an old wreck
You are a moldering wreck
You are a mouldering wreck
You are a rotting wreck
Give me back my pants
My uncle lives in a mansion
We need to review the budget
The odds are against him
The patient remained in bed
The patient stayed in bed
There needs to be a decision
We may still coexist
Please write a reply soon
Please reply soon
Come and enjoy the sunshine
He made up his mind to go
They quickly climbed the tree
He stands by his assessment
He stuck to his opinion
They were just too different
The board will decide that
His plans seem utopian
Her efforts were to no avail
Her efforts came to naught
Their endeavours bore no fruit
Their attempts came to nothing
All is forgiven
She quickly learnt how to type
They described the scenes
He avoided the problems
It seems easy enough
They would prefer stay
They would rather stay
It seems totally impossible
It could prove useful
Write the postcode correctly
The result was modest
It was a modest outcome
Sam had to prove that
Sam needed to prove that
She makes a living writing
Tom got on his bike
You need to change at Shinjuku
Our arrival drew attention
The difference is striking
We need directions
String is sold by the metre
The rumours were unfounded
Tom tried stealing a car
Your hair will never grow back
Tom tried texting Mary
Tom set traps to catch foxes
We learned to work as a team
Tom occasionally stops by
It was like a gold rush
Tom is going to give it a try
My pupils are in love with me
I told her I loved her
Tom changed my mind
Rima has a petite frame
Rima has a petite build
This freaked Ziri out
Ziri is a year older than Rima
Ziri ran out of the bathroom
Ziri was getting dressed
Ziri went to the locker room
Berber is our next class
Ziri said Rima flipped him off
Ziri forgot his keys at home
Ziri slept on the mattress
I suggest that he go study
Ziri dozed off peacefully
Ziri was full of bravado
It might be raining right now
We could be doing sports
Tom thinks Mary likes him
Maybe we should stop the car
Ziri took his shirt off
She wishes she were on holiday
It does not taste good
I have worked for twenty years
I worked for twenty years
Now I am a retiree
I have been waiting for you
I am waiting for you
He is travelling tomorrow
I am busy tomorrow
He shall travel tomorrow
What a blow
His back hurts
He will travel tomorrow
He is looking forward to it
Tom is willing to help Mary
You need to keep an open mind
After my task is to wait

Stop pounding on the wall
Now my task is to wait
You have the option to refuse
Tom can stop doing that now

Call in the cavalry
You are dumb
I am dumb
Tom is doing this for Mary
Tom came over to talk to Mary
We divided the catch equally
Health before wealth
Tom never tried to get help
Math is my strong point
Attentiveness is not my thing
Patience is not my specialty
Flattery is not my thing
Flattery is not my specialty
The narrative is nonlinear
Sweep the terrace
Every action evokes opposition
Tom shook his head in grief
Rage and greed are dangerous
Fury and avarice are dangerous
Tom walked back to the stables
These trees will grow back
The pandemic is far from over
Tom stopped his car
Become yourself
Tom tried to cheer me up
The cake is about to be cut
The article has a lurid title
Take some warm clothes
Take some warm clothing
The train is about to leave
An appeal may be lodged
Streams are becoming torrents
Think it over a bit
She hurried along
She walked briskly
She walked at a quick pace
Progress comes at a price
Her dress is long
The food is about to be served
Ring me when you get there
Phone me when you get there
Tom tried the same thing
A group of men walked by
Tom left before Mary saw him
Tom is stuck here with us
You need to put a stop to this
Get out of here

Be a good kid

The bus slowed to a stop
Their demise is inevitable
They intrigued me

That cat is swag
Vane and vain are homophones

She ably handled the situation

Sorry to interrupt
Sorry for interrupting
We went to bed very early
Its beauty is unparalleled
The campaign ends at midnight
Some of them went into a skid
She exceeded the speed limit
Nan is making some eggy bread
Our fridge is on the blink

Give it here
Think of me now and then
Go to see a doctor immediately

None of us think like that

Go look for it
It seems that he is fine
Please talk to me
I am not available

Stay here with me
Save me some of that mutton
I want something to eat
Thanks

I had nothing left but misery
She spoke relatively quickly
The water was lukewarm
They kissed for a long time
It has been such a long time
I was bored to death
Tom took me under his wing
I have a horse
Tom pointed the finger at Mary
Tom has a thick skin
Stay here with me
She was exactly like a child
Indeed
Nobody walks in LA
I knew you were OK
Please tell me Tom is OK

Tom sat up in bed
Tom was in bed
Tom felt snubbed
Tom was easily influenced
The carts were being loaded
Tom smiled and nodded
They succeeded
You come highly recommended
Tom was dumbfounded
The prison is heavily guarded
They all applauded
This is serious indeed
They might have what you need
They might sell what you need
I can be exactly what you need
Tom kept me up to speed
Tom scoffed
Tom casually shrugged
Blows were exchanged
You will be charged
Tom looked up and laughed
Tom never laughed
The girls laughed
Tom was genuinely astonished
I have to be punished
Tom looks a little flushed
You very nearly died
Tom was by no means satisfied
Tom was perfectly satisfied
The baby just kicked
The clock ticked
The crowd looked shocked
The jury looked shocked
Tom also talked
Nothing has been overlooked
Not all cops are crooked
You sound terribly overworked
The leak has been sealed
Tom is deeply troubled
The game got canceled
Tom was baffled
Tom leaned back and smiled
Tom sat back and smiled
Tom seldom smiled
Tom also smiled
Please forget I called

My husband was killed
I could have you killed
Tom tried to have Mary killed
You sure had me fooled

Tom was a little startled
Tom whistled
I know what got Tom rattled
Tom was completely puzzled
Tom was alarmed

Tom stiffened
The kitchen door opened
A lot has happened
Things happened
Tom was very frightened
Tom quietly listened
Tom was ruined
Tell me what Tom has planned
Tom was mentioned

The group was impressed
Tom was deeply impressed
Tom looks distressed
Our paths have crossed
Tom was a little confused
Tom became confused
Tom is now genuinely confused
The report may be exaggerated
Tom was irritated
Tom might not even be infected
Tom objected
I know Tom is connected
It was just as you suspected
It was to be expected
Tom was delighted
They were discontented
Tell me you were adopted
I always knew I was adopted
Tom began to get downhearted
The office was deserted
The office is deserted
Tom was momentarily interested
You should have Tom arrested
We should have you arrested
Tom protested
Tom never even knew I existed
We all want to be rescued
Tom looked pale and fatigued
The static continued
You must be deeply relieved
Life needs to be lived
Tom arrived
I know Tom is involved
Tom and Mary never moved
Tom bowed
You never showed
Tom followed
Tom was overjoyed
Tom was extremely annoyed
You just need to be organized
Tom was terribly afraid
We had to do as they said
We had to do what they said
Tom confirmed what Mary said
You never said what you did
Tom was mugged as a kid
Tom lifted the lid
Tom is hardly a child
I must be getting old
I suddenly felt old
Tom suddenly felt cold
Tom is still out cold
The water was icy cold
Tom was very cold
Tom is on hold
Tom did what he could
Tom held up his hand
Tom put me in command
Fire on my command
None of them could understand
Tom seemed to understand
This road is a dead end
We want that to end
I can make you a legend
I said Tom is a friend
I can be your best friend
Tom snuck up on me from behind
This is the good kind
I know your kind
Try to have an open mind
Put it out of your mind
Tom is clearly out of his mind
Tom has a brilliant mind
Tom never even entered my mind
Tom is a mastermind
I need you for just a second
They were nowhere to be found
Tom is nowhere to be found
I glanced around
Tom is hard to be around
Tom has been looking around
Quit screwing around
We were just screwing around
I quite like having Tom around
Tom loves having Mary around
Tom stomped on the ground
Tom looked at the ground
There was no sound
I felt like God
This ought to be good
I have to say you look good
This is for your own good
That was no good
It feels so good
That feels so good
That massage felt so good
I think ambition is good
It would do you good
Tom was really good
That sounds really good
That would be very good
Tom is looking pretty good
That sounds pretty good
There goes the neighborhood
Tom is my flesh and blood
I wish I understood
Tom maxed out his credit card
Tom had to shout to be heard
You look positively haggard
Tom is trying real hard
They branded you a coward
I leaned forward
It feels weird
This is off the record
I have a juvenile record
Tom has no prison record
I eat what I can afford
You said the magic word
You need only give the word
I just got the word
Tom unsheathed his sword
Tom lowered his sword
Tom pulled Mary out of the mud
Tom laughed aloud
Tom chuckled aloud
Tom pushed through the crowd
Tom emerged from the crowd
Tom finished drying his face
I knew I recognized that face
My jeans ripped at the seams
Tom looks out of place
I gave at the office
I can be nice
That might be nice
It felt nice
You had to make a choice
Tom clearly has no choice
That leaves us no choice
Tom will have no other choice
We all have a price
Every dream comes at a price
You were wrong about the price
Everything has its price
You can ask any price
We value your advice
Tom jumped at the chance
There is but one chance
You were my last chance
I had my chance
Tom was in a trance
I know how to make an entrance
We require no assistance
Tom got rid of the evidence
Tom was on the fence
Tom wanted an audience
There was a dead silence
There was dead silence
There was an awkward silence
Tom broke the silence
There was complete silence
There was a brief silence
There was a long silence
Tom broke the long silence
They ate in silence
They went on eating in silence
Tom motioned for silence
Please forgive my impertinence
I put Tom down as a reference
That makes all the difference
Tom never knew the difference
Tom meant a lot to me once
I must leave Boston at once
The choice has been made
The bed is unmade
Tom was held back a grade
Tom teaches the third grade
That would help me decide
You have one minute to decide
I know all the places to hide
You better hide
I suggest you hide
Thanks for saving my hide
We took a ride
Mary was such a lovely bride
The law is on our side
Look on the bright side
Tom was right by my side
Tom is still parked outside
Tom opened his eyes wide
You just need some coffee
My services are free
Tom was happy and carefree
I heartily agree
I climbed a tree
I can see what I need to see
This I have to see
It was a sight to see
I can only see what you see
That much I guarantee
We have no guarantee
They were safe
Tom always plays it safe
I have a life
I want a life
Tom is in the prime of life
Tom was scared for his life
Tom is fighting for his life
You were my life
You were the love of my life
I trust Tom with my life
I have to go on with my life
I have an understanding wife
I felt like a bird in a cage
I need to change that bandage
I know all about marriage
I think we can manage
Tom printed out the page
Tom turned another page
You made the front page
I need you in the garage
Tom handed Mary the message
Call when you get this message
I checked the gauge
I had no such knowledge
Tom leaned over the bridge
I might be ready for a change
I can feel the change
You need to make a real change
Some things will never change
Tom is really acting strange
It feels strange
Tom rose to the challenge
I gladly accept your challenge
The group was too large
Tom had a bad headache
Save yourself the headache

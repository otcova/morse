Give me something to snack on
The crowd is jubilant
The crowd is going wild
The shirt is tight on him
The shirt is pulling on him
My swimsuit is very tight
They are afraid of publicity
The affair was made public
Tom could hardly speak
She has a quick grasp
She understands things quickly
That sounds pretty mediocre
Tom does not look scared
We began to dance
Tom knows just what to do
Start with simple sentences
Measles can be very dangerous
But reading is pleasure enough
Try to sleep if you can
The sounds are too difficult
We held our fire
It was not a mere coincidence
I teach students Russian
Sasha the Ukrainian enters
People are more negative now
Marijuana is prevalent today
I saw Tom standing all alone
The sky is grey
There is a musky smell
He has blue eyes
Handle it with care
It has a chemical taste to it
I practice every day
Tom is the best dancer here
Orientals did gardening
Your feet smell pretty bad
It rains cats and dogs
Bring me the bag
I wonder why Tom left me
Today is hot

I have some petrol
Someone stole my hubcaps
The author is my friend
We have a very good boss
I heard Tom singing a song
Tom thought he was special
Tom stumbles and falls
Only Tom can save us
Everyone knows what Tom did
The businessmen like this city
The enemy defense was broken
He walks on hot coals
Tom can see this
I just saw Tom yesterday
Bring that back to me
Tom can go there
I know why Tom lied to you
I will check this
Put on your blue dress
Put your blue dress on
Tom smiled at everyone he saw
Stop playing a fool
Winter had been easy
A cup of tea awaits me
It has been a long winter
Winter has been long
Your arguments are stupid
They called again
Nobody is evil
A bat flew past
A bat flew
My apartment is tidy
They are in town
They are in the centre
Those are my grandkids
My house is near the park
She gets off the elevator
The personal is political
Martha is a talking dog
Yesterday there was sun
Ziri learned how to talk
I will go to the theater
The thief broke the lock
The water is calm
Summer was beautiful
I am so very picky
He started with me
They understood why
He locked the door
I love little girls
The money is dirty
I wish we could do that again
Tom can afford it
We relish the challenge
Soon it will rain
Tom rose
I see no need to do that again
I know many words in memory
This is a book about animals
Tom returned to his home town
A nail punctured the tyre
That way is how I feel today

The results were very bad
The process will be messy
The procedure is the same
They jumped
My mother prepared breakfast
My cheeks were red
The sun caressed her body
Try to look confident
Tell your grandfather I say hi
Judge by the result

Cyrus he sends for
With these we will fight
I shall not let him go at once
They have left us
Thou hast sight and seest not
An army was being gathered
He kept finding many pretexts
Thou shouldst not be silent
There he remained
He paid the army wages
I have often wondered
He did not adopt the view
Hippias received the rule
Would that Orestes were near
Would that I had met you then
O that I had never seen thee
Cyrus ought to be alive
O that I had never left Skyros
Let me not be wronged
Leave me not thus alone
Let no one speak
Let this occur to no one
I would not yield the chair
Let them go
Let no one of you speak
Let it be otherwise
No one shall ever say
Do not in any case flee
He will never yield
I will never follow thee
Thou remindest me of sorrows
Toil to toil brings toil
Things will come of themselves
Here come the boys
He had nothing to tell
I am about to suffer

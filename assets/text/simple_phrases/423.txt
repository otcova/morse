I will prepare grilled fish
A dam broke
He never learns
Tom gets paid more than Mary
Tom is afraid of being hurt
Tom is expecting Mary to help
A tranquilizer dart hit Tom
She asked me to give you this
Avoid the obstacles
I found a mouse in the attic
The governor has pardoned Tom
The governor pardoned Tom
The FBI has questioned Tom
Ah
You have enough to do
He was totally silent
He was completely silent
He was silent as a tomb
Marie never mentioned it
I need good vibes
He is in a long tunnel
The view is impressive
He was executed at dawn
Hard work beats natural talent
I want the real deal
I pumped up my tires
I pumped my tires up
Stop the car
I need to get out
The fire is spreading quickly
I ache for your pain
It hurt all over
My heart ticks me
My head is pounding
He judged me negatively
I always speak my mind
Lie down on the couch
He was a cool guy
I like to dress well
You will nip it in the bud
Bleach is a caustic substance
The ball hit the post
Singing is really part of you
He suffered from scurvy
Scurvy raged on board the ship
Scurvy raged aboard the ship
The plow is plowing the soil
The church feeds the pastor
He was sure otherwise
He likes dirty phrases
Together we burst out laughing
I have to take Tom away
I have to drive Tom away
I have to kidnap Tom
I love pine woods
I love coniferous forests
The dark side of love
This lake is greenish
Seawater is greenish
The wind never stops
We are incredibly lucky
You acted wisely
Push the ship
Her hair was shaggy
He gets off with little girls
You mock my intelligence
It tickled
I listened to your bullshit
She has big apples
She has very big apples
He solved the conundrum
That law is still in effect
The truck is on the scales
That merchant is a scoundrel
They walk in a line
Use what you need
Greed is always a bad adviser
He is a true son of his father
We both love licorice sticks
He stood at the window
The filters need changing
Tom broke wind
Tom passed gas
I will be at home at five
The wastebasket is full
Please read this book
It will make you feel better
I saw bear tracks in the snow
We can only go so far
Ziri collapsed onto his bed
Ziri took pictures of Rima
Ziri took photos of us
Ziri was walking to his room
Ziri was walking on a carpet
Ziri broke into a house
Ziri wished for that to stop
The movie ended at four
Ziri decided to give up
The SD card got corrupted
Ziri had the volume off
Ziri vacated the lease
We are at the beach
My parents think I am at home
I saw her in their yard
Loyalty begets loyalty
A spoke on my bike has gone
My bike has a broken spoke
Your tyres have had it
The government keeps lying
Is there a road to Kg
War is the cause of many evils
Rima has an ass like a mare
Ziri has an enchanting voice
Ziri has an amazing voice
I need it for an exam
They do not nap
They did not nap
They have not napped
Tom is a master of sarcasm
I smell gasoline
I often have hot flashes
You have a nice ass
We saw you at the beach
He has a spirited look
I woke up in a bad mood
This saddens me deeply
I had great parents
Retreat is not defeat
They always want to turn right
I thought you were a big kid
My left ear lobe is swollen
Blow up the balloons
Cookie is a pretty cat
Tom laughed without thinking
Tom stuck with his plan
Tom lives in an enormous house
Tom never shrinks from danger
Tom looked at us expectantly
It looks like a partridge
The partridge is clucking
I like dried sausage
They went to get dried sausage
The tapestry is a little old
There are no separations
He came to apologize
He grabbed him by the lapel
I got rid of them
I congratulate you
He swallowed his pizza
I heard about the incident
He took a crush on me
He eats breakfast there often
They headed downtown
Tom agreed to do the job
They attended every meeting
Take this medicine every hour
I wanted to read them all
The cat licked its paws
This plate is damaged
I bought a new sweater
This plate is broken
Wipe them out
Tom has two moms
Little things add up
Economies go in cycles
Tom swung the bat
She only needs your money
My name is Jules
There are many possibilities
My name is Lucy
Our dog is so funny
He is much better now
The news made him dizzy
I met him three hours ago
I give lessons on Skype
He writes poorly
He bit more than he could chew
My mom made cakes to sell
He really deserves it
He left the keys on the table
Tom lived in a cave
This is a very important role
He is speaking Russian
Ziri was breathing a toxic gas
Ziri unlocked the door
Ziri is a drug dealer
Zir found the key to the door
Ziri found the key
Ziri found the needle
Ziri threw Rima into the pit
Ziri threw Rima into the hole
Ziri has to act fast
Ziri tried to anger Rima
A random door opened
Ziri got out of the box
Ziri got out of the room
Ziri was stuck in the box
Ziri pushed the door open
Ziri could have found the key
Ziri grabbed the key
Ziri started beating up Rima
Ziri arrived at the house
This already happened
Ziri found Rima still alive
Ziri will die in a dungeon
Ziri escaped the house
They all agreed
They all came
They all heard that
They were all dead
They were all worried
They all stood still
They all answered
They all replied
They all passed the test
They all saw that
They all took the test
They all grew up in the woods
They all camped there
They all ate sausages
They all ate marshmallows
Tom ate all the marshmallows
They all used the restroom
They all stood up
They all donated money
It really hurt my feelings
My favorite fruit is a banana
I have a burden on my heart
I began to brown the meat
He gave me a great price
Tom is an eccentric
Tom is a kook
Tom has two loaves of bread
Many people are saying this
He finishes eating in silence
I witnessed the whole thing
I snuck out of the house
It took me over an hour
You told them not to do that
I know everything about Tom
I know everything about Tom
The sailor fears a shipwreck
Mary gave me a friendly nod
He knows him very well
Mary has a dimple in her chin
He was a very technical man
The sky was a deep blue
I just wore my bathing suit
Tom has two mothers
You destroy everything
Vaccination works
Ziri has an epidermoid cyst
Mary is my first love
Those who marry want a home
You have gone to bed
You are a showy person
Wedding asks for a dwelling
The morning air is crisp
He looks relaxed
Beauty is everywhere
I retranslated the English
I only see the flaws in people
He kissed the tip of my nose
I just want to be understood
The temperature went up
She tried to seduce me
I have noted it
She has a milky complexion
She has a voluptuous body
He uses a lot of honey
He has a nose for business
He knows the territory well
The evening went smoothly
You are not a woman
Melanie eats pizza
She writes
He writes
They are writing
They read a book
They are cooking
We are cooking
She is cooking
You cook
They are cooking now
He is cooking now
She is cooking now
There are islands in that sea
Welcome to the Wikipedia
I live in a flat in the city
You are kindy
Rain is rare in this country
Tom died from dehydration
He seemed genuinely surprised
His concert was awesome
Sami tried to sell her car
I am quite busy right now
He sees
He smiles
He dives
Tom has no bicycle
The woman is a teacher
I would like a ticket to Trier
That is no problem
I love that game
Tom has a black bike
I need some blue color
Tom love chocolates
They are cousins
He is clever
Tom cannot read
The sun shines
I gave him some books
I live in Luxembourg city
I study German and biology
My mum lives in Dudelange
The girl has seen it too
It is hidden under the bed
My snorkel is dirty
I go to Paris
Forgotten is my favorite movie
Tom hates raw onion
I like to go for walks
We are already coming
That I can not imagine
We are closed tomorrow
We want to stay what we are
I order a lot on the internet
I hope that you can come
I saw you in the park
My husband is Luxembourgish
My aunt is living in New York
Canada is bigger than Japan
I eat berries
They live in the Crimea
He is their father
I ate a breakfast pastry
Maria kneeled
In Spain you speak Spanish
Tom is a Jew too
That I ask myself too
I am a dentist
Tom and Mary have a girl
I am using that
Tom is a little boy
Tom loves cheese
It is a Christmas tree
Not everyday is a funfair
I set out to help her
He has class
Silly you
Tom got the same gift as Mary
Tom shaved his beard off
Tom lay on his back on the bed
Tom went somewhere
Tom has been in many movies
Tom always stays up late
Tom ran water into the bathtub
Tom has gone abroad by himself
Tom filled the bathtub
It never ends
He could be in the sports hall
He might be in the sports hall
Tom is a rival of mine
Tom was reluctant to go there
Tom was excluded from the club
I felt the need to apologise
Tom was kicked out of the club
A friend of mine speaks it
I met Tom on the way here
No
Tidy your desk
Tom is hoping to get promoted
Please take a look
He finally came to his senses
That person is pretty tall
I might have forgotten the key
Its symbolic colour is orange
I had a light supper
The houses were sold
This is my humble abode
He kicked the kitchen counter
He was sipping lemonade
She is completely drunk
She saved her friend
He showered me with gifts
I like to make snowmen
Tom fights for human rights
Say this in English
It was a good party
The gray cat purrs
He never missed a parade
We wrote a report
Try to be the former
I love your purse
Today was a lot of fun
There are many such cases
The waves are enormous
I think Tom was in Australia
Hang the towels up
Everybody was dead
I expected to be busy
Tom switched the lights on
Tom may have left Boston early
I was about to marry her
I was about to take that
I intend to pay for it
I wake up early to go to work
I play sports on the weekends
His hair was messed up
Everyone succumbed to panic
I just have one condition
Go to school or get a job
Let him concentrate
I write in correct Italian
I brought a sandwich for lunch
Shove that money up your ass
We want to see these movies
He got down on all fours
I lost my fountain pen
I dropped my fountain pen
She is a chemist
He is a chemist
He emphasized its importance
He was blown up by a land mine
Go and play outside
We were
Linda is meeting him tomorrow
Linda will meet him tomorrow
Anyone can say that
Come on
There was no one on the pier
There was no one on the dock
I left the ship
This is an anthology of poems
The reward is enticing
Things went well for him
This is an ice pick
Tom is on board with it
The goldfish are all dead
All of the goldfish are dead
I seldom speak French with Tom
I rarely speak French with Tom
He left me for no real reason
I went through months of hell
Tom is a nutcase
Tom is a leech
Tom is just a leech
Tom is a bit of a kook
We need to nip this in the bud
Just a minute
I need to put on some clothes
Many people have said that
I felt the need to apologize
Go and play outside
We make out for a few minutes
I like you too
Two months later he relapsed
She was buried by an avalanche
My dog is afraid of thunder
I want to see the sea
We were incredibly lucky
My problems seem to never end
Fake it until you make it
You are just a soulless doll
You are just a soulless puppet
He remained indifferent
She remained indifferent
They discredited themselves
You discredited yourself
They falsify the numbers
He first worked in the village
He is wanted
He has been declared wanted
He sounded very tired
She sounded very tired
I return her smile
Tom wore thermal underwear
Tom wore a parka
Tom wore warm clothes
Tom wore a hoodie
Tom wore a coat
Tom wore a warm coat
I wish I could ski like that
I am about to leave
The world is mine
The world is yours
The city is noisy
He lives far from here
He lives far away
They live far from here
They live far away
We live far from here
We live far away
They look horrifying
You must be asleep
This is just a temp job
I washed your clothes for you
I washed your clothes
The cinders are still smoking
Those were her last words
Those were their last words
Vacation is over
Juan colored his house black
Florencia comes from Chile
She is Chilean
Leo is making leche flan
The blanket is red and green
Ziri has a lot on his plate
Everybody smiled but Tom
Ziri ate one of those fruits
She has beautiful hips
Ziri went foraging
Not for me
Ziri has an orchard in Tigzirt
Stop shitting yourself
She pulls off her boots
She removes her bra
His behaviors spoke volumes
Ziri was on the roof
Ziri turned on his flashlight
Ziri ran toward the ladder
Ziri ran toward Rima
The log was rotting away
Ziri got close to the log
Ziri wanted to threw up
Ziri walked along the ditch
That noise woke me
That sound woke me up
I lost my husband so early
You betrayed us all
This did not bode well
This was not a good sign
The man looks down on me
I need you right away
There are four of us in all
Tom waited for them to leave
I stayed hidden in the trees
Every detail is important
His wish was granted
The wind tousled my hair
The clientele seemed satisfied
They lowered the radio volume
Tom was playing tennis all day
This statement is not official
I tried to get Tom to laugh
You should probably leave
It looks like a fox
Tom saw you there
Tom bent over in pain
I need to talk to you
My son is about your age
Go ahead and do that
Quite a few people do that
He plays piano and guitar
Ziri is such a nuisance
Ziri came to see us once
Ziri already has Rima
Ziri took the box back
Ziri slammed the door shut
Ziri looked all over the house
Ziri has gotten rid of the cat
Ziri ran out the front door
Ziri was never going back
Ziri was perfectly fine
Ziri is not fine
Ziri was evil
Ziri never walks under the sun
Ziri is just curious
Ziri is the meanest boy around
Ziri picked on Yazid
Ziri was returning to his seat
Ziri went too far
Ziri has found his new target
Ziri is a janitor like his dad
Ziri must have done it
Ziri has no proof
Ziri hates rich people
Ziri felt worried
Ziri was running towards Rima
Ziri felt betrayed
Ziri just ignored Rima
Ziri looked horrified
Ziri is a liar and a thief
Ziri needed the money
No one knows how I feel
Ziri was angrier
Ziri is still a freak
Rima is gorgeous
Rima is our prom queen
Ziri was super nice to Rima
Ziri came back to work soon
Ziri pinned Rima to the ground
Ziri pinned Rima to the floor
Ziri pushed Rima away
Ziri cried like crazy
Ziri hugged Rima tight again
Ziri started to cry
Ziri never expected that
I wish you told me sooner
Ziri kept behaving that way
Ziri was whispering
I feel so darn lonely
Ziri sat outside on the porch
Maybe mine is just an illusion
Tom went to bat for me
Grab me if I feel dizzy
I know the restaurant
Give me time to get there
I began to feel some anxiety
You have evicted us
You evicted us
Your family is looking for you
Put yourself in my shoes
He had a bad night
The sun had just set
I was seized by a sudden fear
My feet hurt like hell
The canteen was packed
Wait a second
Wait a minute
That was Mary
I want to take care of you
Now I see how right she was
Tom was far ahead of his time
You saw that yourself
She got Tom to change his mind
Try the other one there
Put on your dress shoes
Put on your dressy shoes
I need another pillow
I know how I can do this
War is show business
I always tell the truth
Even when I lie
Tom was sitting on the bench
I love weed
I love grass
Electrons orbit the nucleus
I have a good visual memory
Tom would do that all the time
I can express myself just fine
Sit wherever you want to
Sit where you like
Ziri peed in his new pants
Ziri had a math test coming up
Ziri was terrible at math
Ziri was burning with jealousy
Ziri sucks at math
Ziri expected better from Rima
Ziri snuck out of the window
Ziri laughed and walked away
Ziri rushed here to see Rima
Ziri left Rima at the carnival
Ziri snuck into the attic
Ziri can fake a Kabyle accent
Ziri walked back into his room
Ziri got a black eye
My pack is very heavy
My backpack is very heavy
My knapsack is very heavy
He was all full of blood
My rucksack is very heavy
I was thinking what to do
He was walking at a good pace
The young woman sighed
I am looking for my cat
You screwed it up
My hands are tied
It was a sunny Sunday morning
I need to go at it harder
I love cats more than people
Arm yourself
Arm yourselves
She knows neither me nor you
Huh
My schoolbag is heavy as hell
Our cause is just
The enemy will be routed
Victory shall be ours
Yup
All I did was think about you
Your mobile just rang
Tom is an old school friend
I learned nothing at school
He invited me into his home
I decided to trust him
They are on your side
Sunset is round about five
He swears like a trooper
He swears like a sailor
He left the room unnoticed
I live in this neighbourhood
I live in this part of town
Moli knows some Hindi
He has a disastrous past
Panic swept over her
He was watching it
Spread your arms apart
No one witnessed the scene
She was watching it
Everyone has those days
His birthday is tomorrow
They have no credibility
The filters need to be changed
I wish for more wishes
That machine is bad
The computer is red
I need a tool
Open the machine
Use this tool
The worker is using a tool
The computer is off
My computer is broken
I hate people cutting queues
I like November without you
Winter is on its way
It does not turn him on
We had a hell of a good time
He is a chicken
Out of sight is out of mind
Everything is so meaningless
He had blood on his hands
He broke up with me for good
They wanted to see each other
Thanks
Of course
I never make the first move
We all believe in you
The left goes on top
Absolutely nothing
Even Tom knew
That would be more worthwhile
I hated to explain
That little girl won my heart
This spoon is a tablespoon
Everything is decided
He grabbed a handful of chips
My grandmother left us a roof
Jeanne will eat your lemon
I love soups
Be careful
Please remember what I said
Everybody saw that
Everyone has those days
No one forced Tom to do that
This round is on me
It gives you the willies
I called my secretary
He is as blind as a bat
She stood me up for tonight
He wants to see me dead
You seem to be a lonely man
You are really sad
You alone could help me
This life sucks
Close the door
He started crying like a baby
He smiled lovingly at her
We got together
The question seems complicated
He has a sentence to serve
He changes houses all the time
He uses fake names
He has sudden bursts of anger
He killed him in cold blood
He runs an electrical store
Dairy cows are useful animals
Not great
I like Boba Fett and the Hutts
I could watch the swimmers
How annoying
I risked going to jail
I got seven years in jail
He returned around noon
His opinion matches ours
His opinion squares with ours
There are only six people here
There are just six people here
I do
Everyone looked away
I have relatives in this city
We lined up for the bus
Esther was born on a kibbutz
Your enemies are an illusion
She felt hurt and abandoned
I like your method of working
Tom wished me good luck
Tom seems to be really nice
Nobody else is here
They argued bitterly
He has regained his sight
He has no concerns whatsoever
No one speaks well of him
Never do this again
Get a move on
There are people waiting here
We walked together all day
I ran for the hills
I got some time to waste
Please help me get the mouse
I had to work for everything
I doubt you really like me
I went out with him for drinks
She ate the whole apple
Only my mother understood me
I cover you
We have a wealth of options
I normally let it slide
He drove him home
Tom is our child
But I feel well
He had a cold attitude
He feigned mirth
Maybe Tom is very ill
It all happens here
Everything comes here
The wine has gone to my head
No one else twigged
No one else got it
Press this button
Then a door will open
You fish on the river
I used to live with my parents
Now I live alone
This thing is important
But people can do this
But the earth was without form
You want to tell me this
We can take a walk
My heart knows no more joy
He turned a smile on her
God created man to suffer
Tom stumbled
Tom stumbled over a rock
We stumbled around in the dark
Tom stumbled back home
Everyone is looking away
You got one last chance
Her appetite was inconsistent
Tom became a recluse
It was definitely Taco Tuesday
I made french toast
The window was being broken
They deserve to win
He is lactose intolerant
He has a gold tooth
Please stop bothering us
It was about three weeks ago
Tom said that I looked sober
I want to buy sunglasses
No one else got the joke
I have some time to waste
We have a lot of options
I almost died laughing
I want to give my wife a gift
I turned down the radio
I turned the radio down
They promised us freedom
His is campaigning
He thought he had been rumbled
I like to be honest
I like you as a person
I insist that you stay with me
I missed another opportunity
The horse is snorting
The seal is snorting
She breathed in deep
I felt all on fire
Both mercenaries are dead
The decision was appealed
The verdict can be appealed
I saw a wolverine
You need a tutor for German
Her works do not become stale
Set up attainable goals
This is a full attainable goal
You look slightly different
I was lost in my thoughts
Mary was visibly nervous
He wanted to punch him
I would like to forget you
I wish he would leave me alone
I want to see you fulfilled
I promise to think about it
He stroked my cheek
Tom is perfectly normal
The garden is wet with rain
It was a late cancellation
He will renovate the place
Give her those books
Give her the books
Give him those books
Give him the books
Turn the radio on
I booked a return ticket
I booked a return
Honey comes from bees
Give me three of everything
I left my brolly on a bus
He left his brolly on the bus
I hardly ever go to the cinema
Stagnation leads to decline
Time seemed to freeze
He lives on a barge
The barge floats on the river
Grab a chair
Have a bite
Eat some if you want
She will soon
I am not really a psychiatrist
Food prices have soared
Food prices are skyrocketing
Food prices have skyrocketed
The sick person is better
Dreams help us to live better
We need to keep fighting on
Demand has declined
There was some shooting
I heard some gunshots
She had to go to a hospital
I need to study English
I told him to wait here
I need you too much
They embraced on a bench
You made a questionable choice
He who thinks is
I was out like a light
I screwed around a lot
He dodged the law
He is a lookalike
He is a wimp
Never cry over spilled milk
He knows what sorrow means
Let your feelings flow
I swim like a fish
The book covers several topics
He sees the world as hostile
They were defeated in battle
A roaring lion kills no game
This is my favourite colour
You yourself saw that
I inflated my tyres
I can just tell
Tom doubled up with pain
He has a family that needs him
She wears a lot of jewellery
That must hurt
Today is the summer solstice
Tom seems proud of his son
My kids love liquorice sticks
Mum is just baking him a cake
I think that man is lost
I reckon that man is lost
Today is too cold for a picnic
Tom was a schoolmate of mine
I found the empty tin
He held his hand out to me
Sweat beads on my forehead
It makes my eyes burn
I have sore muscles
I threw his hat in his face
He choked me while making love
Even angels eat beans
I got honey
I was bitten by a zombie
I had to look it up
The cows grazed peacefully
He stepped on my feet
The boys are playing football
On Sundays I go to the library
After work I watched a movie
Give me a hand please
He kicked away a rock
How ugly is that
Anger took hold of me
The devil wins sometimes
Tom is a hog butcher
Tom is a brawler
Tom asked me for forgiveness
I miss everything about you
You held me tight
I cried with joy
I am so afraid of death
The lab runs on a shoestring
The boys are playing rugby
Your absence destroys me
I still love you infinitely
He tried to give me strength
He was never yours
The chair has a broken leg
This is where the story ends
You are my hope and support
That dress really suits her
This dress really suits her
He can get excited like a kid
Tom became more ill
I put on a little makeup
I like to plan things out
I need you to come immediately
My bladder is bursting

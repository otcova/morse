One of them is lying
One of the girls smiled at Tom
One day Tom will understand
I liked that song
Sing us another one like it

She set the table for supper
You will see horses everywhere
We were in four

You should try one of these
You should get one
You picked a nice one
You only get one
You have to pick one
You have to choose one
You got one right
You get the next one

They should have one
They outnumber us three to one
They got a big one
The only one in danger is you
The middle one is mine
That was a pretty good one
That one usually works
Tell me one of your stories
Show me one of those
Promise me one more thing
Pardon me one second
Only one thing worries me
One witness was present
One tire looks a little flat
One of you must be lying
One of us could win
One of us could be the winner
One of the knives is missing
One of the guards is dead
Now you owe me one
Let me try one of those
Let me try one more time
Let me try another one
Let me take this one
Let me take one of these
Let me get you one
Just answer one question

Excuse me for just one second
All I need is one

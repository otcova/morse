Ziri is an avid hunter
Ziri must do something
Ziri began to give up hope
Ziri freed his other leg
Ziri passed out of exhaustion
Ziri kept the jackals at bay
Ziri did this to Rima
Ziri returned from lunch
Things escalated even more
Ziri loved his career
Ziri resigned form his job
Ziri ate his sandwich
Ziri returned from his lunch
Ziri walked up to the tree
Ziri was staring back at Rima
Get off my land
Ziri ran back to his truck
The oak trees were cut down
Ziri sat beside Rima
Ziri was too far from the camp
Ziri was doing other things
Grab me a beer
The light became blinding
Ziri was left looking for Rima
Ziri passed out in his chair
Ziri seemed different
Ziri would not allow that
Ziri walked deep into the cave
He eats nuts
Ziri squished the spider
Ziri entered the cave
He replies saying yes
This text is worth translating
He came running to the meeting
I take my bath singing
This word comes from the Greek
Put them side by side
Put them next to each other
He walked here
He walked all the way here
He came here by foot
He came here walking
I got sand in my eyes
He considers him a friend
I would like to see them now
Ziri lives in a remote place
Ziri went to a nature reserve
The deer began snorting
Those rumors are a fallacy
Bucks are not friendly
Deer remember faces
The buck charged Ziri
Gazelles are social animals
Ziri kept his doors locked
Ziri reached the hill
It was unnerving to be there
Ziri tried his best to focus
The gazelles were spooked
Ziri turned and saw Rima
The gazelle reared its head up
Ziri carefully backed away
Ziri wanted to document that
The gazelle stopped moving
Ziri sat himself in the car
Ziri got spooked
Ziri broke one of the rules
Ziri kept to the rules
Ziri walked off to his station
Ziri enjoys his privacy
All this makes my head spin
Ziri lives in central Algeria
Ziri is a former army soldier
Ziri is a former jarhead
Ziri loaded his guns
The cans were clinging
It felt a bit odd
Everything was pitch black
Ziri had his back to the fire
Ziri kept the campers awake
Ziri stopped and watched us
Ziri went back to the camp
Ziri found the tents shredded
Ziri picked up his friend
Ziri walked to the bus stop
The area is quite brightly lit
Ziri decided to leave the cafe
It started to rain heavier
The fields were quite flooded
Ziri spoke to Rima in a panic
The phone just turned off
This was incredibly weird
Ziri is now a dad of four
Ziri saw jackals
It was a beautiful landscape
Ziri entered the treeline
The woods were dead silent
Ziri examined the skulls
Ziri pressed on into the woods
The gazelle was still alive
Ziri found a tool made of bone
It soon got too dark to see
Ziri hiked for hours
Ziri decided to turn around
The men were following Ziri
Ziri was not budging
Ziri soon forgot about it
Ziri drove up next to Rima
Ziri heard the growl again
The growl was louder this time
Ziri went to a nearby city
The property was vacant
There was lighting and thunder
Ziri was out of sight
Ziri checked all the windows
She does know my name
All beings are beautiful
He showed us the right way
We were present there
She lives near a library
He lives near a library
You stayed home
You want to be famous
He decided to stay
Singapore was a poor country
You are a strong person
He is a strong person
I was born into a poor family
Tom has never lost his temper
Choose calmly
Midwesterners are kind
He wrote it to me in Latin
All creatures are beautiful
She is not Finnish
As the old saying goes
We played football on the rec
Petrol prices have come down
The wound must be stitched
The wound needs to be stitched
Eyes front
He enlisted as a volunteer
I insist
I insist on it
There are no further warnings
I see through his lies
I can see through his lies
I feel very at home here
You should respect her privacy
The fire alarm was set off
Tom has a thirst for knowledge
You need official documents
The people there were not nice
Ziri was in his late forties
The area was heavily forested
Ziri hiked that park often
Ziri loved that park
Ziri became more uneasy
Ziri can still see Rima
Ziri was still freaked out
Ziri ran off into the woods
The dog was lounging at Ziri
Ziri said nothing to Rima
Ziri turned the flashlight on
Ziri heard a demonic voice
Ziri tried to be friendly
Ziri picked up his lighter
Ziri knew that he was safe
Ziri bought a restaurant meal
Ziri decided to skip a week
Ziri got four free gifts
Ziri enjoyed the service
Ziri enjoys this kind of stuff
Ziri had no time to get ready
Ziri loves them all dearly
It smelt like rotten garbage
Ziri has not done anything
It was a nice place to walk
Ziri ran to the other side
The sound startled Ziri
The service was very weak
Ziri headed down the set path
Ziri headed to the main path
Ziri soiled his pants
The soldiers passed Ziri
Ziri tried walking quickly
Ziri dragged a bag behind him
Ziri was unsure of what to do
Ziri ran and ran and ran
Ziri fled as fast as he could
Ziri went to a beach party
Ziri was alone in the woods
We are similar
Mary dances at home
Greed is always hungry
Not a penny was in his pocket
I rented a tux for a wedding
I rented a tux for prom
I need to get fitted for a tux
He loves his country
The quote sparked a discussion
Ask those who know
Zelenskyy has to go
Ukraine needs a new president
This story may be new to you
Ziri read classic novels
Start your free trial today
Ziri was injured in the fight
My memory is hazy here
Ziri moved into his new home
Ziri had panic attacks
Ziri followed the hiking trail
The voice spoke up again
The voice told Ziri to come
Ziri did not move
Ziri froze in place again
Ziri was saying soothing words
Ziri died in that schoolyard
Ziri retook his seat
Ziri wanted to join Rima
Ziri stood before Rima
Ziri did not live
The fog has vanished
Stay out of that park
Ziri was able to speak
Ziri experienced that himself
Ziri came running for help
The path was familiar
Ziri came closer to the trees
Ziri got startled at the sound
Ziri became more agitated
There was no pulse
The man was dead
Ziri hid from what scared him
Ziri yelled at Rima to comply
It all became a big mess
Ziri was awaiting his demise
This is what has spooked Ziri
Ziri would join Rima in death
Ziri grabbed a branch
The creatures were gone
The dragons circled in the air
Ziri turned his head away
Ziri tightened his grip
Ziri climbed down the tree
Ziri allowed himself to rest
A tornado happened in the area
Ziri ran for cover indoors
Ziri had his dream job
Life was good
Ziri has been drafted
Ziri joined the infantry
Ziri gladly agreed
Ziri gladly accepted the offer
He was orphaned at a young age
There was no convincing him
Toss me the remote
They exist to this day
It annoyed me
One chance and you blew it
Never cease to disappoint me
I am without a penny
I came wanting to be with you
This is my contact information
I walk singing in Greek
Tom killed Jesus
Wolves are noble creatures
Midwesterners are naive
Midwesterners live on farms
You refuse to understand
I know a bit about calligraphy
Time is cyclical
Jews are a nation
Their religion is Judaism
I have no defects
I drive my own car
I almost died of boredom
Ziri was on a routine patrol
Ziri pushed through the jungle
Ziri went back for his canine
Ziri dived on top of Rima
Ziri wanted that to stop
Ziri kept crawling
Ziri got to his feet
Ziri slumped down next to Rima
Ziri left Algeria
Ziri was back in Algeria
Ziri got back on his feet
Ziri thought that was illegal
Ziri bought Rima a burger
The practice was outlawed
Ziri had his dog with him
Ziri handled snakes
Ziri lives in a hamlet
The locals call it Sasquatch
Ziri handles venomous snakes
Ziri just looked at Rima
Ziri made a phone call
Come meet Pastor Ziri
Ziri sang a cheerful melody
The music ceased
Ziri came into view
Ziri came to greet Rima
Ziri took the dog outside
There are no booby traps here
Ziri reentered the tent
Ziri asked Rima about snakes
These snakes really bite
Show Ziri how we are unafraid
Ziri recited a Bible verse
Ziri will never die
Ziri held out his arms
Pandemonium erupted
Ziri drove back to Algiers
Ziri has noticed Rima
Ziri was resurrected
Ziri turned to face Rima
Ziri came back OK
Ziri came back different
Ziri descended into panic
Ziri slept with tears
Ziri drove down to Algiers
Ziri was expecting Rima
The congregation was silent
Ziri was carrying a shotgun
The snake was still alive
Ziri will not sleep
The snake began to move
The dead man was moving
The snake began to slither
Ziri spoke in tongues
Ziri was begging Rima to leave
Ziri visited Rima at the motel
Ziri is clinically deceased
Ziri was horrifyingly strong
Ziri cannot hear them
Ziri fell back
Ziri let go of the shotgun
Ziri was in the dirt
Ziri ceased to move
Ziri delivered the killer blow
Ziri must live with that
Ziri apologized to his editor
Ziri took a job in Algiers
Ziri has a new dog these days
Ziri stayed overnight
Ziri observed the wildlife
Ziri headed up the hill
It was warmer than normal
Ziri walked through the forest
Ziri continued on his path
Ziri watched the treeline
Ziri just sat and watched
Moose have antlers
The creature was massive
The water is so pristine
Ziri exited the trail
Ziri can go there at night
The beast dwarfed Ziri in size
The hyena charged at Ziri
Ziri was nearly unconscious
Ziri found Rima passed out
Ziri wished he could go hiking
Ziri looked at his window
Ziri was never seen again
Ziri simply got lost
Ziri fell and got injured
Ziri grew up in the woods
Ziri works in a forest
Ziri was found alive
One of the four has died
Ziri was walking alone
The forest is not very dense
Ziri was still behind the tree
Ziri threw his dog a bone
There is not much to say
Ziri hiked almost every day
Ziri must be getting old
Ziri has never picked up
Ziri responded by screaming
Ziri played movies in his head
Ziri rushed through the trees
Ziri was standing by the tree
The phantom was gone
The dog is free from the leash
Ziri followed his dog
Ziri ran away from the ghost
Ziri wanted to throw up
Ziri has become so disoriented
Ziri heard echos of a voice
Ziri laid next to Rima
The bone hit the floor
This filled me with dread
Ziri inched forward
Ziri moved faster and faster
Ziri is not meant to see that
Ziri was just too busy
Ziri did not want to go back
We will take over the world
As we live we learn
You can leave a review
Check the speedometer
Help me find the cursor
I lost sight of it
Site traffic is dropping
This code is easy to crack
I love turnips
I broke my shin
The yearning never got away
Ziri did not have to tell Rima
Ziri was a logical guy
Ziri can handle the case
Ziri was a seasoned explorer
Kids went missing
Those spots are miles apart
Ziri climbed out of the car
Ziri climbed into his car
The lights stopped appearing
Ziri initially ignored that
Ziri was screaming at Rima
Ziri walked around
Ziri walked to a nearby tree
Ziri felt his body drop
Ziri was dazed and confused
The bones were varied in size
Ziri fell into a hole
Ziri assessed the threats
The monkey climbed higher
Her parents were teachers
Ziri kept an eye on the hyena
Ziri created a map of the area
Ziri did have a map
The hyena got far away
Ziri did have a knife
Ziri opened the map
Ziri needed to move forward
A hyena appeared
Her car is ready
Ziri found an open cavern
Ziri planned his attack
Take your time in choosing
Pet him
Tom is making boiled eggs
Trump killed Epstein
I hate death
That woman died
I was dying to kiss her
I like it when you kiss me
He is not your enemy
His election is in the bag
That server has high latency
If only half of it were true
Whoa
I let him read the comics
Your feedback is appreciated
Now pay eight dollars
Tom forgot his coat downstairs
Sami was at the bank
I need just a second
Let your muscles calm down
Ziri gathered the sticks
Ziri was in the right spot
There was a clicking
Ziri looked at the tunnel
Ziri pulled himself up
Ziri climbed out of the hole
Ziri was out of the hole
The hyena came out of the cave
Ziri started his way home
Ziri showed Rima the map
Ziri got lost in the forest
The shadow was gone
Ziri dropped the sandwiches
Ziri tried several things
The shadow was very tall
Ziri had a pretty hard time
There was a forest nearby
Ziri will be back at midnight
Ziri heard the owls
Ziri reached out for Rima
His hand was bloody
Ziri was laughing hysterically
Ziri was completely shocked
Ziri remembered that story
They found a body in the woods
Ziri enjoyed cooking that dish
Ziri pulled his flashlight out
Ziri came to look
Ziri had a cup of coffee
There was a field on my right
It was not a gazelle at all
Ziri said what happened
Ziri has never had a dog
The cat kept meowing
Ziri was dragging his dog away
Ziri was nearly in tears
Ziri woke up at around four am
Ziri took that path
Ziri ignored that feeling
Ziri pulled his dog forward
Ziri read that in a newspaper
Ziri met someone new
Ziri has been here before
That feeling came back
Ziri was definitely spooked
Ziri slept until down
Ziri unloaded his sleeping bag
The sound was very close
Ziri heard Rima breathe
Ziri heard no noises
The area has many roads to it
Ziri went to a picnic area
There were no street lights
The devil appears there
Ziri asked his friend about it
Ziri parked in national parks
It was very nice out
Ziri heard his dog growl
Ziri decided to sprint
Ziri is watching scary movies
Ziri drove up that mountain
This always has me frightened
Ziri is not paying attention
Ziri was playing with his dog
Rima stared at her boyfriend
The sun had set
Ziri started googling windigos
Ziri has gone missing
Ziri was found dead
Ziri can continue his hike
Ziri spoke in a gruff voice
Ziri said something in Berber
Ziri wore combat boots
Ziri was so well equipped
Ziri is not a tough guy
Ziri helped Rima make dinner
Ziri heard the sound clearly
Ziri walked to the bathroom
Ziri screamed and woke Dad up
Ziri decided to go off trail
Ziri froze instantly
Ziri almost soiled his pants
Ziri heard some animal digging
Ziri heard running steps
Tom speaks Peggy Hill Spanish
Ziri is only four towns over
Prove that Tom matters to you
He is too young for me
We must respect the elderly
Jews have no central authority
You are my group of friends
All humans are siblings
Ask her to come straight away
Ask her to come immediately
Good things take time
This flower has a sweet scent
We had to run
It is uneven
The level is uneven
I had a true friend
It burns my feet
This restaurant is busy
We must wait for a table
I leave in one week
My feet are itchy
Only the truth matters
Ziri was armed with a knife
Youth has its own culture
The boar is wild
Wild boars grunt in the meadow
Wild boar are hunted at night
I just want to add something
I want you to say something
Just take what you need
You also had to see him
You must decide
Do that
Dad is the boss
The bird sung on the branch
Put less parsley on it
Put more salt on it
Add more pepper
Voters waited in endless lines
Be a bit more patient
We live close to a big pool
Please lend me the car
Maria is yawning
Tom can remember everything
Tom speaks broken Spanish
Tom speaks bad French
Everyone was scared except me
I like my pants
Water is pouring down my head
We need an avocado
The laptop really became cheap
Ziri heard noises in the woods
Ziri always heard those noises
Ziri headed into the woods
Ziri heard the sounds
Ziri heard crunches and snaps
Ziri ran to the shed and hid
Ziri started looking at Rima
Ziri is forever grateful
Ziri was against the tree
The creature had black skin
Ziri never looked back
Ziri came to the door
Ziri heard Rima screaming
Ziri could not see anything
It was definitely not a hyena
Ziri did believe Rima though
Ziri heard an unnatural sound
Ziri was forty meters away
Ziri got to the top level
Ziri heard the sound
Ziri is scaring Rima
Ziri was stronger than Rima
Ziri started walking faster
Ziri crossed the street twice
Ziri stepped outside the cabin
Ziri got back to town
Ziri left the cabin that night
Ziri went to a nature park
Ziri went at night
Ziri drank his water
It could be a hyena
The sky was purple or orange
Ziri ran down the hill
The gate was closed
Ziri took the large sea kayak
Ziri fed the horses
The area was incredibly eerie
Ziri tossed the bones aside
Ziri gazed at the doll
Ziri tried not to laugh
Ziri resumed paddling
Ziri stared back at Rima
Nothing too major happened
The kayak struck a tree
Ziri promptly fell asleep
Ziri heard thumping sounds
Ziri punched Rima hard
Ziri took a trip to the creek
Ziri worked next to the creek
Ziri was headed out for a walk
Ziri walked towards the river
Ziri felt dumb
It really was such a fun game
Ziri went into the ditch
Ziri hid in the ditch
Ziri forgot all about it
Ziri was taking some pictures
All the birds are gone
All the bugs are dead
It just felt unnatural
It was almost like an island
Ziri walked to his room
Ziri heard the music playing
Ziri was wearing denim pants
Ziri went into the elevator
Ziri noticed something bizarre
Ziri is in his new studio
Ziri found a body in the park
Ziri was feeling dizzy
Ziri had to work late
Ziri hates paperwork
Ziri heard screaming
Ziri saw no one at the door
There was no one at the door
Ziri stared around the station
Ziri walked forward
Ziri was barely moving
Ziri swore he saw an alien
Ziri was a major skeptic
Ziri took that seriously
Everyone was perplexed
The station is well equipped
The area went silent
Yennayer was approaching
Tom lives with his girlfriend
Tom lives with his friends
Ziri began to cry himself
Ziri does believe in ghosts
Tom loves women
Ziri asked Rima to let him in
Overtime is rare here
The light was very bright
Ziri heard someone screaming
Ziri saw Rima writhing in pain
The fire died out on its own
Ziri arrived and screamed
Ziri showed Rima an FBI badge
Ziri seemed completely normal
Ziri lived here previously
They were testing a new weapon
Ziri liked to camp there
Ziri joined a group of campers
Ziri left with the campers
Ziri left back for something
This naturally concerned Ziri
Ziri reported Rima missing
My girlfriend is beautiful
Write your name next to mine
My mouse ate a cat
A cat ate my mouse
Tom enticed them with promises
This is an ancient monastery
Each convent has its own rules
My mouse was eaten by a cat
Ziri never had a dog
Rochel goes to my shul
Ruchel is a Polish Jew
Rochel is a Lithuanian Jew
Rochel is a Litvak
Anna is Polish
Lina is Lithuanian
The mailman hates the comedian
My dad could beat up your dad
People love Tom
Moishe is a Polish Jew
Meishe is a Lithuanian Jew
Moshe is a Sephardic Jew
She should have kept quiet
He seemed to be struck blind
Our most heartfelt condolences
The room filled with smoke
She was having a nightmare
She had a nightmare
Go if you want to go
You talk too much about her
Finding a flat can be hard
Nobody listens to us
I know all three of them
They ate chocolates
No
Wait until he gets back
Wait till he gets back
Cookie took my seat
She no longer lives here
He is freezing
I have to confess something
I love pineapple on pizza
Emmy
Love is not talking nonesens
He made us feel sick
He rarely goes there
She rarely goes there
Rima rarely goes there
Ziri and Rima rarely go there
Rima and Skura rarely go there
We rarely go there
Ziri went missing late April
Ziri was patrolling the area
Ziri is likely dead
Ziri searched the cave
Ziri was startled at first
Ziri ran towards his truck
Ziri went back to the station
There was no sign of Bigfoot
Ziri was patrolling the park
Ziri observed the hyena
The hyena was rather large
Ziri got mauled by the hyenas
Ziri knows where the hyena is
Ziri backed away slowly
Ziri regrouped with his team
Ziri was training new rangers
Ziri kept the area clean
A jackal is in the area
The jackal always flees
Ziri was clocking out
Ziri caught the jackal
Ziri was pretty tired
Ziri had a rough morning
She was passed out and naked
Ziri was going uphill
Ziri looked terrified
It was raining and muddy
Ziri watched Rima scream
Ziri grabbed the rope
Ziri was no slouch
Ziri heard something fall
Ziri was walking in the park
The alien went into the air
Ziri saw a tree swaying
Guantanamo is a ruthless place
Guantanamo is a brutal place
Cells in Guantanamo are tiny
Ziri started to stink
I bought Tom a coffee
Orange juice is drunk fresh
Impurity is beautiful
Purity is unnatural
Purity is artificial
The day dragged on
The foreman is a film lover
All this is forbidden
Welcome back
Yeah
Hmm
Never mind
He followed him to the village
Those guys are such crybullies
He is paid by the hour
You seem befuddled
The cat followed the mouse
We fall and we get up
I want to play with my friends
I love all my aunts
Elephants have funerals
People used Tom
I speak the Kabyle language
Tom speaks English
Tom also speaks Kabyle
There are no traces
Good friends are never lost
A good friend never forgets us
People loved her
People liked what he did
Stay until tomorrow
I saw Mary at church today
Women have two ovaries
Mary has ovarian cancer
They appear on TV
This is a story worth crying
Wojtek shouted
Ziri is still here today
Ziri watched over the park
The sun was beautiful
The moon was beautiful
The sky was beautiful
Ziri started to breathe better
Ziri woke up in the hospital
Ziri asked if he was dead
Ziri is much too young
Ziri asked what happened
Ziri was eating lunch there
Ziri got Rima to the ambulance
Ziri has a little boy
Ziri is eating healthier
Snorkeling is a fun sport
Ziri went scuba diving
Ziri is a scuba diver
Ziri let water into his mask
Ziri had water in his eyes
Ziri kept his eyes closed
Ziri can keep his eyes closed
Ziri can open his eyes again
It was spring not long ago
Leave the top button undone
My hands are dirty
He fell into the abyss
These kids are twin brothers
I need to talk to you both
It was a bad time for us all
That pillow is dirty
It is full of vomit
These letters cannot be read
Ziri is a friendly guy
Ziri works in the area
The voice sounded quite real
Ziri left the area early
Ziri lived in the area alone
Ziri went missing in the cave
Ziri lost his gear
Ziri visited the cave alone
Caves are dark places
Ziri was seeing things
Ziri searched for hours
Ziri was being tortured
The voices stopped altogether
Ziri got deep into the cave
Caves are massive things
Ziri was found dead in a cave
May Ziri rest in peace
My name is Ziri
Ziri works a job he loves
Ziri just kept nodding
Ziri has to get back
We can meet up and hang out
Ziri calmly called the police
The food is heated in the oven
Ziri finally went to bed
Ziri was about to head to bed
Ziri aimed outside
No one appeared to be around
Ziri kept his gun nearby
Ziri has his gun
Ziri got his car towed
Ziri got his car fixed
Ziri did that intentionally
This made Ziri on edge
Ziri headed towards the voice
Ziri continued downwards
Ziri got there early
Ziri will try again
Nausea hit me quickly
Ziri had to run and fast
Ziri believes Rima is dead
It suddenly began to snow
Ziri got stranded in the snow
It was too cold and windy
The storm finally passed
Ziri is dressed warmly
Ziri spent the night out there
Ziri is gonna keep that brief
I have to be hallucinating
It got dark stupid early
Ziri was wrapping things up
It looked to be a hyena
This thing was a large hyena
Ziri peed himself in fear
Ziri was far off the trails
Ziri very slowly backed away
Ziri could be there in no time
The hyena was coming in fast
The hyena kept coming for Ziri
Ziri kept pushing through
Ziri fell on his butt
Ziri struggled to get up
Ziri stood up again
Ziri continued sprinting
Ziri peed himself a bit
Ziri seemed to be in shock
Ziri was leaving the station
They are not written like that
The coffee was very hot
My mother made us some lunch
A woman lost her son
She cries days and nights
Greek is spoken
Not my cup of tea
He knows everyone
She knows everyone
They know everyone
Everyone knows everyone here
Surprise him
I had to take a cab
He is my grandson
I died from emotional damage
We can learn from the past
Our park is a very nice place
Ziri must be careful
Ziri laughed about it
Ziri avoided the dogs
Avoid petting those dogs
Ziri was a new recruit
The monster devoured Ziri
Ziri is only four
The park closes at eight PM
Ziri went patrolling alone
Ziri came out of the treeline
Ziri looked behind
There were other cops there
Ziri went alone patrolling
Ziri goes to the same spot
Ziri had a horrible headache
Ziri felt a bit dizzy
Ziri sat under a tree
Ziri fell into a coma
Absolutely do not turn around
The view was surprising
Not many visitors go there
Ziri lied about his name
Ziri has never heard about it
There are no benches available
Ziri had sunglasses on
Ziri was always cold
Ziri stood up and ran away
Ziri always stood there
Ziri got bored by that
Ziri had great talks with Rima
Ziri died because of that
Ziri faced a horrible ending
Ziri kept patrolling
Ziri just needs answers
Make sure you are safe
Ziri likes to pet dogs
He was dead
Ziri ran away in terror
Ziri lost sight of Rima
Ziri got impaled
Some of us vomited
Ziri asked Rima what she meant
Ziri rescued Rima from death
Ziri went back in the shack
Ziri found Rima trembling
Your support means a lot to me
Be careful not getting caught
The bridge is not safe
We know the bridge is not safe
I feel dizzy right now
Ziri hopes Rima is alright
Ziri comes here to jog
Ziri sped out of there
Ziri lost his leg
Ziri happened to be nearby
Ziri was listening to music
Ziri scared the birds away
Ziri tried talking to Rima
Ziri made the hyena run away
Ziri became a ranger

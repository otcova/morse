Goodbye
Thanks once again
I want to take more photos
Hello
Tom is very good at tongue fu
The rice is ripening
Tom is walking the dog
These are serious charges
She died in Hatvan
He died in Hatvan
Put this under your seat
We try to do as much as we can
Tom is busy in his office
It has a long tail
He has a big dick
We expect that to continue
Tom walked up the front steps
Just stop thinking about that
We can take it step by step
This is very important now
This is always here
I have learnt it now
My back is itchy
My back itches
She was red in the face
She gently lifted his head
I speak American English
Tom is used to city living
He was exasperated by the pain
She rubbed his temples
We were soldiers together
I got vaccinated yesterday
We are the problem
My wife and kids came with me
Tom allowed Mary to go home
Tom wanted them to get married
My gloves got wet
Tom used to have a horse
These are steps you can take
Tom took his medicine
Tom is going to call Mary
Tom and Mary went inside
Tom has been around
Thanks for lending me money
The children looked happy
The children looked bored
The children looked interested
I wish I had made a complaint
Her breath tickled my hair
I like it
Maybe we could go up there
Politics is politics
I like that teal color
It was bedlam at the airport
The door creaked loudly
Ziri and Rima came eye to eye
Ziri was caught in a trap
Ziri was out of options
Ziri noticed the sandwich
Ziri was passing by
Ziri is a very courageous man
Tom kneaded the dough
Tom wants us to get married
Tom sent us a parcel
I will whip up a salad
Tom lost three races in a row
We are at work again
Everything is within reach
Please try not to embarrass me
That was just a wild guess
Tom took Mary to the mall
He cracks me up all the time
Tom is used to country life
Tortoises can be great pets
Let them try doubling a recipe
Tom owns three sports cars
Stay close and watch your step
Tom will give you a call later
He disappeared from my life
I hate my Berber teacher
Exams always make me nervous
I could explain it to you
Tom has never won a race
A pimple popped on my forehead
The moon is on a diet
The moon is losing weight
I was raised by my grandfather
My landlady is a harpy
He kept getting in my way
We had to stop for the night
Tom was really mean to Mary
You can call me Urso
I saw a woman dressed in rags
Put the knife back
It looks fantastic on you
Tom thought it was weird
The trip lasted for a week
The trip wore him out
The neighbours are quiet
Look outside
Tom was talking to his wife
He rang the doorbell twice
It happens only now and then
It only occasionally happens
We arrived at the same time
Tom has run a bath
Tom ran a bath
He chose the money
You seem to know the answer
My brother remained a bachelor
Surrender to the music
I take good care of my plants
I really want to be with her
Try to brush up your English
Try to polish up your English
Tom took Mary to the fair
Let me take you there
Try to think outside the box
It was fine the way it was
Tom will give Mary a call
Tom is an old grump
Tom used to take me there
There used to be a bar there
The building turned to ashes
The building turned into ashes
The earth orbits the sun
It burst like a soap bubble
Here the trail ends
The discussion was lively
The discussion was animated
Wink at him
Let me put your mind at ease
There was no Mass
The sermon simply started
Tom was the valedictorian
These can easily be hidden
Stand your ground
That would be a huge step
We often ate lunch together
Tom forgot to sign the form
He was of Hungarian ancestry
It takes a day or two
You told me to do this
Iron these shirts for me
I had a terrible weekend
I felt terribly insecure
I felt very insecure
Dust off your jacket
Dust off the table
Dust the table off
Dig this hole a little deeper
Turn up the heater
Turn the heater up
Cook me something to eat
Button your shirt up
Tom is just a man
Air out this room
This room needs aired out
Get off your high horse
I feel comfortable with him
All I do is think about you
I had to learn some new tricks
Just keep that in mind
Gronings is so difficult
Her father is in the garden
Your father is in the garden
I have eaten a boiled egg
I was vacuuming
Tom bought a new shirt
We are all human beings
Life is yours
You have a guilty conscience
He slapped me across the face
I need to dust the furniture
He punched me in the stomach
She slapped me across the face
I faint at the sight of blood
I ordered a banana split
I want more from life
He has golden hands
I was trapped in a closet
I had the hiccups
I started writing in Tamazight
Tom refuses to eat spinach
Thanks for your offer of help
They should talk to Tom
She should talk to Tom
He should talk to Tom
We could learn a lot from them
Tom really needs to get home
Tom trimmed the tree
Tom got restless
I refuse to sign that document
My heart was pounding
My knees were shaking
His breath on my lips was warm
He pulled my hair hard
She was defensive
I wanted to test you
Tom stayed for a few days
That was a huge step forward
No
Tom did his share
Tom is buying a gift for Mary
Tom is buying Mary a gift
Tom got on one of those buses

The answer is absolutely not
No one took it into account
Nobody considered it
If only you were here
We refuse to believe him
I had a terrible day
He bought it at the store
My neighbor is very pretty
I got sick of you
He told the truth without fear
He painted them for me
My neighbor is a cutie
Tom got sicker
Tom got worse
Tom is blind in his right eye
Tom has been working with Mary
These rats have a pointed nose
These are Norway rats
It smells like urine
Clean the dirty dishes
This is a lethal trap
This trap is easy to set
This trap is easy to use
Ziri bought a mouse trap
Place it up against the wall
Empty trash cans
He often brings his umbrella
The government lies
The government is lying
Tom has his own place
It was a good first step
It was a tough lesson to learn
I understand now
Let me gather my thoughts
I want to understand humans
Tom got Mary a good deal
He had a big bruise on his arm
I was in a bar near my house
My cell phone rang
I was sipping my coffee
He lives off his debts
Her eyes sparkled with joy
My hemorrhoids hurt
Tom got grounded
The proofs are overwhelming
We can put a stop to this
Tom said he liked me
It was a pretty big bear
Tom said Mary cried
We retraced our steps
We have so many bills to pay
I love doing so
Tom puts ketchup on everything
You need to stop complaining
Tom dropped by earlier
Tom said hello to me
Tom said he disagreed
He stayed the night
We hid on the island
I made a lot of friends
She knows better
He sat down on the table
They hid behind the house
They ate meat
You ate meat
Tomorrow I will eat fruits
The answer to that would be no
Tom went to see the doctor
Maybe you should get some rest
Tom has beaten me
A new spider mowed in
That may cause problems
I need to vent to someone
He started driving drunk
This is just a stepping stone
I cleaned your room
The prices are as written
I sold two hits of acid
I was the one who was right
Let me answer that question

My daughters will help you
It was such a treat for me
Eat the rest of the stew
Tom got hungry
The new plan worked great
Tom decided to talk to Mary
He tends to be late
Yeah
I am sorry for my odd Japanese
No
I asked Tom for his help

Tom read the book
It was a very tight race
Tom blew his lines
We have water
I expect Tom to be there
We may not be able to do that
We need to try something else
Both sides agreed to talk more
Just stop calling me
Stop calling me already
He stood up sharply
There is no danger
You should offer them a refund
I got a good job offer
Both men drew their guns
That movie made me cry

They are still cleaning
My suitcase is very light
The answer seems to be yes
Tom gave me this painting
This stuff is hard to get
I got here yesterday morning
We locked all our windows
The answer is definitely no
Tom said Mary could swim
We have no time for that
I left my toolbox at home
I packed my bags
You might learn something
Tom said I could leave early
I wish I could stay here
I bet Tom will be back soon
Tom may not know how to do it
We believe the answer is no
Tom is exactly like Mary
It felt like a step backward

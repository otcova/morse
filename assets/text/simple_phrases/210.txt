The judge pardoned him
Suddenly the sky grew dark
It can break the chain
I eat cheese
I eat meat
It rained yesterday afternoon
It rained all last week
The window opened
The upstairs window opened
I am an earthquake
So that was it
Three of my children died
Liisa came too late
He got up and went away
I put on my shoes
I pretended to be working
My knees crack when I squat
My knees crack when I run
He got up and left
My hair is wet
He just wants my attention
He did not agree
She did not agree
Try to enjoy yourself
I never leave home without it
She let him kiss her
He let her kiss him
She reached up to kiss him
I just want to go to bed
I saw the pictures
Mary let Tom kiss her
Tom let Mary kiss him
Tom committed many crimes
Prostitutes make more than me
You see the sun very little
He said his name was Tom
She said her name was Mary
She got married and had kids
She has a blog
No one reads my blog
Hardly anyone reads my blog
This story broke my heart
She crossed her legs
She uncrossed her legs
We scaled a sharp peak
I love cooking
Put on your glasses
I concur fully with his text
Up with your hands
Put your hands up in the air
Lift up your hands in the air
He is so presumptuous
Alexander died in Babylon
He who risks not gains not
All were young once
We were all young once
Everyone was young once
The earthquake caused the fire
I baked these cookies for you
Make me understand
Help me to understand
A boy risked death to protest
That was two years ago
I reflect also on another fact
This is a given objective
Children understand everything
Make it fairly alcoholic
We must be satisfied
I am truly happy for you
It says in the title
Do not place this in doubt
Begin to change this
Luxury has come to you
The apples are finished
All the apples are gone
This is not sure
I did it in a hurry
I did it in haste
I have a meeting
I have a lot of ideas
I got everything I wanted
I get up early in the morning
I failed
I need to open this door
Only Obama knew about it
There is a lid for every pot
I bought this for my boyfriend
I bought this for my friend
I bought this for my mother
I bought this for my brother
I bought this for my sister
I bought this for my father
It gets the job done
I want to go to Germany
I feel a good cry coming on
I slept too much
Good question
I like to observe people
See the preceding example
This crate contains apples
I have a new pair of socks
I like red meat
Somebody moved out in a hurry
They accomplished nothing
I wondered what Tom wanted
I want to get my hair cut
They cut my hair too short
Reply to my message
Dave would call his security
It is terribly expensive
It stinks in here
He plays the bagpipes
She was ecstatic
I just got here
My grandmother died
The law has been changed
I love going to the beach
He was framed by his wife
There is no beach in this area
He just got back from Paris
They never last for long
Fish is expensive
Meat is expensive
Your roommate is creepy
She did as she was told
He did as he was told
I write when I can
She has a serious boyfriend
He has a serious girlfriend
Neither of them like me
She was so sweet and innocent
She was beautiful and innocent
She is one of my best friends
She stayed at home all day
I need to clear my head
She drank a sports drink
Tom wants to go hunting
It is a beautiful image
Twenty is a beautiful age
Focus on the goal
That was a miracle
You bought bread
True friendships are abiding
He teaches his friends English
True friendships last forever
I understand a bit of German
Now I know how to fight you
It was in English
Tom is preparing supper
Tom shouted at Mary
Nobody dies
No one dies
I play the piano well
I like spicy Mexican food
I would never be your husband
I would never be your wife
The meat is expensive
This is not spring
I was busted to a sergeant
This concerns you
Try to compose yourself
All flowers smell sweet
Plants do not have a brain
He knew this was wrong
He knew what he did was wrong
Plants grow towards the sun
Plants grow towards sunlight
The teacher read the book
Ask her to lend me some money
This is good for me
This does me good
He ate bread and meat
He ate fruit and vegetables
You sent milk from your dairy
You sent a letter from Algeria
He ate insects and spiders
I forgot my password
We are preparing our meal
We prepared our meal
I learnt Catalan very quickly
Lida was from Colombia
I met her when I was in Madrid
I want to know what you know
I met Tom when I was in Boston
You jumped high enough
My makeup was ruined
The villagers fear him
His parents are out of town
His parents were out of town
I love all flowers
I want to teach today
I am the manager of my own
He never found out the truth
They never found out the truth
I work in a flower shop
Basket weaving is a dying art
She loves flowers and plants
I saw her crying
Cry all you want
I sent you some flowers
He sent me some flowers
He sent her some flowers
He made me cry
She made me cry
She made her cry
I am so hot
I am like a sun
I picked him up from school
I picked him up at school
This plant looks sick
I have no idea what I am doing
I thought it was pretty good
She fell asleep while reading
She finally read War and Peace
People are strange
Her eye was swollen
This plant is green
It was worth it in the end
She feared traveling alone
This work is hard for us
The shirt must be ironed
The battery is dead
Quit complaining
You have to go
A little bread and butter
That car is a Chrysler
The market is large
He has no friend to speak with
The floor is dirty
I want you to know
He was furious
She was furious
She has a a tidy apartment
They looked at him
She looked at him
She went too far
He went too far
The sheets are clean
The sheets are dirty
I hope you like trains
She behaved exceptionally well
They pushed him aside
They pushed her aside
They asked for our advice
They asked us for advice
They asked him for advice
They asked for his advice
Ask for his advice
Consult with him
Consult him
Consult with her
Pirates are cruel
She fixed him something to eat
He loves you
I know he does
It was an accident
She picked up her books
I can rest
I can take a rest
She opened her backpack
He dug a hole in the sand
The pirates boarded the ship
I want to shake his hand
I do not know where to start
He became his great friend
He has never hunted
Tom is asleep in his room
She paused in surprise
Her room is in the other house
Please count your change again
The cost of living is rising
The criminal confessed
Tom was condemned to death
Sharks can sense blood
The whole room became silent
My shoes have holes in them
My shoes are not comfortable
I threw away my shoes
I need new shoes
This is incredibly frustrating
It is an honor for us
My house is a shack
My house is a shanty
She cared for his wound
No one trusts him anymore
Until tomorrow
He left from there
The sheet of paper was torn
Tom yelled something in French
Tom is my second cousin
The two boys are cousins
The cows are milked at six
Court is adjourned
Mary is my cousin
Nothing much is happening yet
Tom is a bit older than Mary
We live in a wonderful period
She is my friend
Tell her she has to get up
She wiggled her toes
He wiggled his toes
Tom makes a lot of errors
She was just about to go out
We missed you last night
I just met a sexy MILF
Whatever
That club is filled with MILFs
Good night
Tom makes a lot of mistakes
Tom made a lot of mistakes
Tom hardly ever makes mistakes
Tom seldom makes mistakes
Tom rarely makes mistakes
They gathered flowers together
I cut myself with a razor
I must get my hair cut
Tom cut his hand when he fell
The devil is a squirrel
That game is boring
We must be cautious
Half an hour passed
No one is here
Health is wealth
Milk comes from cows
Bacon comes from pigs
I dropped my sandwich
I bit into my sandwich
I almost dropped my sandwich
The sandwiches were awful
She handed me my sandwich
I finished my sandwich
You can have my sandwich
I ordered a BLT sandwich
He made himself a sandwich
I want to hear your story
Her hair was a mess
Shut up and sit down
He was mortally wounded
By the fact itself
You have done a good job
My name is Laurie
Betty killed her own mother
I can do the deal
I have to sell it today
Hedgehog is a proud bird
Wednesday is a little Friday
I have to sell all today
I have to sell them all today
Thanks for existing
I love Istanbul
I sit when I pee
She is not ugly
He is afraid
Another world is possible
Freedom is only where power is
Cooking pasta is easy
I bought a slow cooker
Sorry for the late reply
Never ask for the obvious
But not in front of the choir
But not before choir practice
The sea is green
The boy is strong
The girl is beautiful
The pig is pink
It happens in Lithuania
This is a table
This is a chair
This is a bag
Aoife is loved by everyone
Aisling seems very happy
I want to learn Irish
Tom looks very sleepy
I feel perfectly fine
Please step out of the car
Please step out of the vehicle
Let me show you
These are for you
They burst out laughing
I take care of him
I straighten my hair every day
Her brother looked at her
She is mischievous
She began to cry again
She has white teeth
He has big feet
She has big boots
She is watering her flowers
You can handle it
She has tiny feet
She has some freckles
She has big lips
He was supposed to be here
Give it up for this trooper
He writes badly
I am proud of you
We should eat something
Both of you are right
The room is sunny
The girl opened her umbrella
This is a girl
These are students
My ideas are always great
Always lock the door
Please come back later
I remember that place
I learned a new thing
It is a table
This is not a table
That is not a fish
It is not a dog
I live in Sarajevo
She is my gipsy wife
Everybody agrees
He has wide shoulders
He resembles his father
I am warm
John chased Mary
The cat is old
Be peaceful
The Party is always right
A good deal remains to be done
I feel dead tired
I got up at the crack of dawn
I worked all day yesterday
It was a dangerous trip
Mary is very dear to me
Mary wore a dark brown dress
They said the deal was off
This lake is very deep
Tom dared me to do it
Tom dealt fairly with me
The dog will bark
The old dog barked
The dog barked softly
The dog has been barking
We had no end of fun
She has wide hips
She has narrow hips
Give me a little ice cream
That puppy barks very loudly
They might hear us
I love you
Eternity is a long time
His hair was tousled
I really need this paycheck
He complained about the food
I tried not to stare
You are handsome
I became intrigued
I really like this song
Everything will be okay
I promise
I dream about him every night
I dream about her every night
Your question is illogical
His car has a turbocharger
Each to their own
It was interesting and amusing
This car needs new tires
It was three in the morning
He climbed up the ladder
She leaped from her chair
She leapt from her chair
He leaped out of bed
He leapt out of bed
He had no desire to kiss her
Waves are generated by wind
I saw nothing at all
Please turn off the lights
It took me by surprise
It exceeded my expectations
She moved to Germany
He moved to Germany
God be with you
Tom almost never calls Mary
I do not cut their hair
He has bats in the belfry
We were a perfect couple
Take your hat off
It can be considered as rest
Tom will lose time
Mom will lose time
The subject is too deep for me
They differ in many respects
Tom gave Mary a diamond ring
There are three empty rooms
He probably likes it
She probably likes it
The thief smashed the window
Your car is being towed
They are not happy
Last night was really awesome
I run ten kilometers daily
I ask you to forgive me
There is some work to do
I run ten kilometers a day
Think of the starving children
I ate only bananas
All I ate was bananas
This is a quiet street
I want to hibernate
Your keyboard needs replacing
He was sent to the galleys
It can be expensive
She found what she wanted

The bag has two outer pockets
He has white teeth
Queens is my favorite borough
My ink is better than yours
Chess does not rely on chance
I consider her a good friend
I consider him a good friend
He made a sand sculpture
No one showed up
He has clear blue eyes
The water was blue
We had a fun day at the beach
They did not believe me
I felt attracted to him
I felt attracted to her
This man is good looking
The restaurant is full
They split the bill evenly
We ate dinner at a restaurant
You have much to learn
Leave it in my hands
Nothing is heard about him
Please take note of that
This glass is dirty
This fork is dirty
I hate cold winter days
I hate rainy days
I hate the winter
I hate winter
I love this time of year
I love sitting on the beach
This tree is tall

He was sitting on the bed
She covered me with a blanket
My dog likes chasing squirrels
Squirrels like nuts
Look the setting of the sun
Not all laws are just
This law is unjust

You know him better than I do
He wants to buy a pony
She wants to buy a pony
He used to play poker with us
She plays poker with them
He has problems at school
Show me your hands
The yogurt is delicious
She has problems at school
She is playing poker with them
She used to play poker with us
I know her quite well
He covered me with a blanket
We dined at a restaurant
It might be expensive
It may be expensive
It could be expensive

I love the way you treat me
I love the way you hold me
I love the way you say my name
I love the way you sing
I live in Antalya
The jungle was dense and thick
They played on the jungle gym
No one ever saw him again
No one ever saw her again
They entered the jungle
There were flowers everywhere
I am not surprised at all
She wants to be popular
I know who started the rumor
I think we need more cookies
I think we need more sentences
They are both talented
I love Native Americans
This baby is half a year old
This baby is six months old
You make me want to cry
I trust her
I need a writing pad

Sorry about the last time
I had the same version
The car was stolen
That was tight
That was hilarious
He went to the barber shop
She went to the beauty parlor
I gave him a huge hug
Never mind that right now
I hope she is okay
They went to Disney World
She fell asleep on my shoulder
He fell asleep on my shoulder
I fell asleep on his shoulder
I fell asleep on her shoulder
Her action deserves respect
I also like apples
He spoke about peace
I know whose bag this is
Canadians are not Americans
Now I am busy
I will learn Uzbek this year
Go and tell him
I would do the same
They never get old
Give him the horns
I would buy him a beer
I would lick him in the ear
Buy him a beer
You annoy me
Tom was not jealous
My bad
I get everything I want
I can get anything I want
My brain is exploding
He is really a good worker
That bed is very comfortable
I will write a letter
Give me the report on Monday
These horses are yours
These horses are hers
These horses are theirs
These horses are his

People should love each other
In an old castle lived a king
I am fat
Your daughters are beautiful
Waves extinguish a wind
My memory is slow
He wishes he had glorious hair
Our yard is large
Your pen is bad
I can teach you if you want
This is going too far
I like extracted juice
Tom is sure
It really happened
He drew an apple
Give me all the money
Please give me this money
I call the boy and he comes
It seems he knows Ann
She gets paid a lot
She had two cell phones
He really got sick
We were surprised by that news
He is good and coherent
Your breath smells
You have bad breath
You are right
She is busy
Wait a minute
I have the ace of spades
I have the ace of clubs
I have the ace of diamonds
It is what it is
The boy begged for a new bike
Tom just woke up
I will go to Athens
Athens is in Greece
I always go to the beach
I chew gum
I ate the red apples
I ate the green apples
I went to the beach yesterday
I never go to the beach
Forget about it
They most certainly know
I think that this is Emet
Good luck with the new job
This is the best way to die
We learn much from experience
One hour until the event
Wet floor
Fickle rabble
He treats me with severity
He went into the bazaar
No one wants to volunteer
Tom is a volunteer fireman
I can fight my battles myself
He knew where he put his pen
He knew where his pen was
I think telling lies is wrong
The cookies are in the jar
Thinking too much is bad
You think too much too
I feel like an amoeba
A promise is a debt
I know that she is pretty
Sit over there
Your sleeve is in the soup

I stared at the ceiling
I think Tom hates my dog
It was kind of fun
She wears a girdle
We became good friends
I already know
I was just trying to help
I kept my mouth shut
We drank some wine
She got really mad
He got really mad
She loves flowers
He loves gardening
I will see you around
I thought it was stupid
He thought it was stupid
She thought it was stupid
She thought I was stupid
He thought I was stupid
I thought he was stupid
I thought she was stupid
I never mentioned it again
He never mentioned it again
She never mentioned it again
My phone rang again
I just borrowed it
I just borrowed it permanently
Guys are stupid
Tom thought Mary was stupid
Tom thought Mary was happy
Tom thought Mary was pretty
I love both of them
I read two books last week
I loved them both
I liked all three of them
I met Tom and Mary yesterday
Good day
Those pants are too big
I wanted to know what happened
We forgot to lock the door
I got really mad
He was not far behind
She was not far behind
She got her ears pierced
He got his left ear pierced
He got his right ear pierced
I want to get my ears pierced
Pierce whatever ear you want
She got her nose pierced
He got his nose pierced
She got her nipples pierced
She got her navel pierced
I cringed
He carried her bag
The food will get cold
She cheated on the test
He has stretched earlobes
The future was better before
The future used to be better
He snapped his fingers
She snapped her fingers
I was angry at myself
He was angry at himself
She was angry at herself
We ate surf and turf
We ate lobster and steak
He never woke up
She never woke up
He admitted that I was right
She admitted that I was right
I admitted that he was right
I admitted that she was right
It is unintelligible speech
Objection
Motion for continuance denied
The defendant is free to go
The defendant stays in custody
This is a class action
This is a deposition
We have a pretrial conference
She sings like an angel
I asked Tom to stay out of it
I asked you for the truth
I asked you last night
I came all this way
I cracked the code
I dated Mary for a while
I decided against doing that
I decided it was a good idea
I decided not to study French
I decided to ask Mary out
I decided to go swimming
I decorated my room
I definitely heard a scream
I demand a refund
I demand an explanation
I demand the truth
I demand to be told the truth
I deserve an explanation
I deserve to be rewarded
I deserved that promotion
They prefer tea to coffee
He prefers tea to coffee
You prefer tea to coffee
I was losing balance
She talks quickly
Please sign on this line
My plane had already taken off
I will never marry you again
I have never been to China
I did a bad thing
I did a little research
I did as I was told
I did do some checking
I did everything for Tom
I did everything I could do
I did everything right
I did everything you asked
I did find something
I did have fun
I did it all by myself
I did it all on my own
I did it already
I did it anyway
I did it for Tom
I did it on my own
I did it on purpose
I did it three years ago
I did it without you
I did my homework
I did my job
I did my part
I did no such thing
I did nothing of the sort
I did see something
I did some research
I did something bad
I did that once
I did that one time
I did the right thing
I did Tom a favor
I did try to warn Tom
I did try to warn you
I did warn Tom
I did warn you
I did what had to be done
I did what I had to
I did what I needed to do
I did what I was asked
I did what I was trained to do
I did what needed to be done
I did what Tom wanted me to do
I did what was important to me
I did what was necessary
I did what was right
I did what you asked
I did what you told me to do
I did what you wanted me to do
We only use Spanish at home
I dropped the controller
I do appreciate that
I do believe you
I do have a plan
I do have one question
I do have one request
I do hope you understand
I do know that
I do like the way you think
I do like Tom
I do like you
I do my own taxes
I do sympathize with you
I do tend to babble at times
I do that a lot
I do that all the time
I do that sometimes
I do the best I can
I do think I understand
I do this for a living
I do what everybody else does
I do what is required
I do whatever Tom asks
Behave like a man
Edison invented the lightbulb
I look after my grandfather
One fork is missing
This is the truth
Tom always believes me
Tom has two cars
Tom is in the kitchen
Tom is sleeping like a baby
Tom speaks fast
Tom wrote two books
Your dog bit my hand
You seem very tired
Just do it
I think Tom is a nice guy
I still want it
I have to do it
Last month we went to Manila
Tom ran as fast as a leopard
He is from our village
He wrote a book on porcelain
They turned a TV set on
The poor peasants ate potatoes
She suffered from bulimia
It was a godsend
I did what I could
I did everything I could
He said he knows this secret
You were the last to arrive
She went to mass every day
Death is only a horizon
The countryside is magnificent
Every client has rights
I wrote to you from Iraq
You were handsome
I will never forget you
I cannot be without you
I like music
You overrate people
I can smell cookies
There are cookies in the oven
Let me check
I want to eat Japanese sweets
I always have room for dessert
It is pretty cold
Tom is my younger brother
Tom is my elder brother
My cat only eats wet food
He passed away
She has platinum blonde hair
I lost your number
It knocks on the door
You look better without makeup
Her hobby is bodybuilding
It is difficult to be nobody
She has an older brother
I told Mary the whole story
You told Mary the whole story
He told Mary the whole story
She told Mary the whole story
Jane told Mary the whole story
I ran out of money for the bus
We lock the doors at night
We lock the door at night
The naughty boy broke his leg
Nobody wants to touch this
Nothing is perfect
She was seduced by Tom
She was seduced by Mary
He was seduced by Tom
He was seduced by Mary
They bathed in the torrent
The rain came down in torrents
The thermostat is defective
He lacks tact
She has a dominant personality
I bought a new handbag
There is a cat in the kitchen
Datu visited Alvin
You should ask Tom
I go to school on Saturday
Of course he lied
The vicar wore drab clothing
It was a true story
Humans are stupid animals
Your face covered with cum
That thing wanted to kiss you
I doubt if Tom speaks French
I doubt Tom is really a doctor
I doubt Tom knows how to fish
I doubt Tom will agree to that
I doubt Tom will be surprised
I doubt Tom will come
I doubt Tom will do that
I doubt Tom would agree
He is not taller than I
She has long braids
Her father is a brewer
She saw the bulge in his jeans
He saw a bulge in his pocket
Her cheeks were burning
This dog is shaggy
She made a paper snowflake
The sun was bright
They basked in the sun
I prefer ponies to unicorns
Unicorns suck
I drew a picture of a pony
I drew this picture myself
I drink to relax
I drive a black car
I drive a convertible
I drive a delivery truck
I drive a Porsche
I dropped my apple
I dropped out of college
I dropped Tom off at daycare
I drove all night
I drove Tom to school
I eagerly await your decision
I eat cornflakes for breakfast
I eat here all the time
I eat here every day
I eat there every night
I emailed Tom his homework
I encouraged Tom to be himself
I enjoy a challenge
I enjoy being a teacher
I enjoy chess
I enjoy salsa dancing
I enjoy talking with you
I enjoy working here
I entered a singing contest
I entered a speech contest
I erased my name off the list
I even made Tom laugh
I even wrote a letter to Tom
I always unite those two
I live in your world
You are singing songs for me
They located some wild foals
I expect to hear from Tom soon
I expect Tom back shortly
I expect Tom back soon
I expect you to be there
I expected a little privacy
I expected better from you
I fail to see the difference
I fail to see your point
I failed my exam
I failed chemistry
I failed the driving test
I failed the written test
I faxed a map to Tom
I feel a little awkward
I feel a little responsible
I feel a little woozy
I feel a lot better now
I feel a lot better today
I feel a lot better
I feel a sense of duty
I feel all right
I feel awful about that
I feel awful about what I said
I feel bad about that
I feel bad enough already
I feel better already
I feel better now
I feel better than I did
I feel fine now
I feel kind of hungry
I feel kind of nauseous
I feel like I might throw up
I feel kind of sick
I feel kind of tired
I feel like a fool
I feel like an outsider
I feel like being alone
I feel like dancing
I feel like I could cry
I feel like I know you already
I feel like I know you
I feel like smiling
I feel like such a fool
I feel like such an idiot
I feel like waiting
I feel like walking
I feel more confident now
I feel really bad about this
I feel really bad
I feel really stupid
I feel safe here
I feel safe with you
I feel so bad
I feel so much better
I feel sorry for you
I feel strongly about this
I feel the same way as you do
I feel useless
I feel very relaxed
I fell down the stairs
I fell for it
I fell in love with Mary
I fell in love
I fell in the pool
I fell when I was running
I felt a drop of rain
I felt a little dizzy
I felt a little stiff
I felt as if I had no choice
I felt bad about what I did
I felt exactly the same way
I felt it was worth the risk
I felt like a big fool
I felt like I was intruding
I felt like my life was over
I felt like such an idiot
I felt scared
I felt sorry for Tom
I felt sorry for you
I figured everybody knew that
I figured everyone was happy
I figured everyone was hungry
I figured I could count on you
I figured I could trust Tom
I figured I had enough money
I figured it out by myself
I figured it was worth a try
I figured Tom needed help
I figured Tom probably did it
I figured Tom was asleep
I figured Tom was sleeping
I figured Tom would be here
I figured Tom would be older
I figured Tom would like Mary
I figured Tom would panic
I figured Tom would say that
I figured you should know
I figured you would understand
A minute of silence
I filled in the blanks
I finally beat Tom at chess
I finally beat Tom
I finally found my keys
I finally gave up
I finally got Tom on the phone
I find that fascinating
I find that offensive
I fired the gun
I folded the towels
I followed all the rules
I followed the recipe
I followed the rules
I followed Tom here
I followed your instructions
I forgave you a long time ago
I forgot all about it
I forgot all about that
I forgot all about Tom
I forgot my bag
I forgot my briefcase
I forgot my glasses somewhere
I forgot my glasses
I forgot my jacket
I forgot my key
I forgot my manners
I forgot to ask your name
I forgot to call Tom
I forgot to do my homework
I forgot to do something
I forgot to mention it to Tom
I forgot to tell Tom something
I forgot to tell you about Tom
I forgot you were listening
He gave me a sinister look
Silicon is a semiconductor
I wanted to marry him
She died childless
She opened the condom wrapper
The dog sniffed her luggage
She gave him a sensuous smile
Your behavior was disgraceful
I found a job
I found a place to live
I found an apartment
I found it in the attic
I found that fascinating
I found Tom quite amusing
I found Tom there
I found Tom very friendly
I found your gloves in my car
She feigned an illness
He keeps a ferret as a pet
He joined the infantry
She will give birth soon
Vandalism is on the rise
He was staring at her cleavage
It was a deplorable accident
He works in a foundry
The roof is made of thatch
She died of typhoid fever
She borrowed his hoodie
He declined to be interviewed
They painted their toenails
She looked ravishing
You need written permission
He was visibly nervous
I want a scooter
She jumped on the scooter
The cowboy entered the saloon
I went to Canada
I fully intend to return
I fully support your proposal
That sucks so much
Life sucks
Everything sucks
No translation is impossible
The text must be alive
Drinking much is dangerous
Singapore is extremely rich
You won everything
I gather you were hurt
I gather you were unsuccessful
I gave it away
I gave it back
I gave it to Tom
I gave most of my money away
I gave my old coat to Tom
I gave Tom a blanket
I gave Tom a chance
I gave Tom a fake address
I gave Tom a mild sedative
I gave Tom a ride home
I gave Tom a ride
I gave Tom a sedative
I gave Tom all my money
I gave Tom another chance
I gave Tom Monday off
I gave Tom my word
I gave Tom some money
I gave Tom the afternoon off
I gave Tom the day off
I gave Tom the morning off
I gave Tom the night off
I gave Tom what he asked for
I gave Tom what he wanted
I gave Tom your address
I gave up hope
I gave up on Tom
I gave you what you asked for
I gave you what you wanted
Punishment follows swiftly
I get anything I want
I get dizzy when I stand up
I get good grades
I get up around seven
I give you permission to stay
I go anywhere I want
I go out sometimes for a beer
I go to Boston all the time
I go to school with Tom
I go where I please
I go where I want to go
I go where Tom tells me to go

I guess I can wait that long

I guess I fell asleep
I guess I misunderstood
I guess I need a little sleep
I guess I owe you an apology
I guess I should be going
I guess I waited too long
I guess I was lucky
I guess I was mistaken
I guess I was wrong
I guess it sounds a bit silly
I guess my luck just ran out
I guess my mind just wandered
I guess my mind wandered
I guess that makes sense
I guess that works
I guess they speak French

I watched television yesterday

The ham arrived
I killed the rat with a stick
She hopes for tranquillity
There are about twenty of them
The milk is in the fridge

Night draws nigh
The toy is made of wood

My father is an archaeologist
This pond has a lot of carp
She took a bubble bath
She lowered her gaze
Alcohol lowers inhibitions
Tom lives downstream from Mary
We canoed downstream
I risked my life for it
She risked her life for it
He risked his life for it
They risked their lives for it
We risked our lives for it
I have no idea what this means
He offered to carry my books
She gave him a black eye
She disappeared two days ago
The snow is powdery
The snow was powdery
Carrots are good for your eyes
I fell asleep on the couch
I fell down and hurt myself
I fell into a hole
I have to hurry
I must have fallen asleep
The baby fell into the well
Tom fell down and hurt himself
Tom fell off his chair
Tom really did fall for Mary
They eat meat
My father died ten years ago
She loves bone marrow
She lives in the ghetto
She heard gunshots every night
She has a healthy lifestyle
She showered him with confetti
He implored her to come back
This is the zoom button
She used a zoom lens
Alcoholism is incurable
The heretics were burned alive
Add one teaspoon of paprika
The cistern is empty
There are no examples
Tom is a hippie
Sushi is delicious
He is no longer at home
I spent a week in hospital
Tom is an only child
I saw the doctor
She implored him to come back
It has a refreshing taste
She hid under the sheets
Tom pretended to be ill
He forgot to rewind the movie
The boys played softball
I nearly had a heart attack
He was trying to be funny
I was trying to be funny
I felt dumb
He pretended not to see me
She pretended not to see me
She has a great body
He has a great body
He looks nice
She has no fashion sense
He kissed her cheek
I wanted to hug her
I wanted to hug him

Then you cannot be a cannibal
Then you must be Argentinian
So it must be raining heavily
Existence is a good property
Alcohol is the answer
I was told that
A boy saw a dog
Everyone knows that
I also ate two potatoes
They never do
Okay

He hems and haws

They took part in the assembly

A joke is a serious matter
They liked to play in the snow
The war had ended
This issue should be voted on
This is my intention
Read it
I love my city
No
Agh
We were waiting for you
It is not my name
I think he was speaking Latin
Anybody can do this
He was my student
Now he teaches my children
I suggest putting a comma here
It all started with a dream
It all started with an idea
It all started in this place
It all started in this lab
It all started on a stormy day
It all started that day
Over
I better take that back
Come here doggie
I would like to know as well
I would also like to know
I also wanted to know
I wanted to know as well
Larger cars use more gas
No good deed goes unpunished
Luck is a part of life
I like cookies
Jane is fun to be with
A good time was had by all
Not at all
She uses cheap makeup
The director reprimanded you
I eat everything
The stomach pains went away
The lake water is very cold
You have to help me
Stay positive
I could stand no more
I can not do it alone
You need to help me
She is at church right now
Made in Russia
He twirled his mustache
She slept with her boss
Not tonight
He lives in a suburb of London
He lives in a London suburb
Ostriches cannot fly
Let me buy this car
It was mortifying
They laughed at me
I love my tiger duck
She suddenly kissed me
The moon circles the earth
This song is too beautiful

I received a book in Dutch

All the kids were dancing
I hardly have any money

He drank the beer in one gulp
He came with two pals
Sixteen years old
I chose between two options
I saw Dan and Andrei
We have to do the shopping
We should do better
We ought to do better
Spring fever is not a disease
Just look at all these yachts
Take a gander at that trimaran
He finally made it
She finally made it
He finally succeeded
He will be here any moment
He avoids me
The grass is always greener
You are a professor
I will make you pay for this
I know next to nothing
Maybe he did it on purpose
I live a privileged life
I ate sand
Tom had never been to Boston
I paid in cash
That tired boy is sound asleep
Jim tends to exaggerate
A tree is green
It is too much for me
I need to slow down
She dived naked into the sea
Be merciless
These men are strong
The first was not the best
I water the flowers
Those girls arrived
I am trying my level best
I am doing my best
I do my best
Have some pity on me
Life could be a dream
Contractions began
The witness sees the citizen
Once in a while I play golf
My answer is final
Contribute to Tatoeba
Take a little nap on the sofa
Take a little nap on the couch
They seem like code names
Today is a day of compliments
I am not worried about it
It snowed yesterday
It is said that he is wealthy
I hardly think so
Either all or none
There is milk in the fridge
Greece has many islands
He did not read the book
His stomach growls
He dared not jump the brook
It comes full circle
My son is way too skinny
I am a reporter
You have to read the subtext
I am ready to serve you
Every drop is important
You hurt a man
Take a bath and go to bed
We forgot
We failed
Tom winked
Tom recovered
Think again
They voted
They crashed
It helps
It happens
It happened
I waited
I survived
I stayed
I recovered
I promised
He read a lot
Human cruelty has no limits
I found my lost wallet
We are all going to die
All the rooms are taken
I wish I could paint like that
Come back in an hour
Come back in a day
Come back in a week
Come back in a month
She peeked through the curtain
Supra
He made an angry face
There are eight gluons
Dollies have four wheels
The woman has beautiful cheeks
Many admire him
Many admire her
There are many who admire him
There are many who admire her
I like trips
He did it only for my sake
It all went wrong
I love coherence
Every vector space has a basis
He was in my house too
Play the role of Hamlet
He is a man who loves ritual
He loves ritual
He loves ceremonies
He is fond of ceremony
He loves rituals
I am an Esperanto beginner
Mary knows how to swim
That boy speaks like an adult
I can keep a secret
You look fat
I was impressed with her work
He did all the legwork
Some girls just never learn
I love your city
I like your city
Mona had the gift of the gab
All good things come in threes
She has a double chin
I take my hat off to you
The book was still in the car
She cleared off the table
Hell is waiting for you
Hell awaits you
My parents raised me
This photo is too blurry
She wants an iPad mini
He reads a book
He said only stupid things
This is no laughing matter
This looks amazing
I look like a reindeer
This is Italy
I am in Rome
He removed him from the list
You gotta obey the laws
Get ready for a strong scene
The cherry blossom is in April
They came from far away
I like red fruits a lot
They invited me to the wedding
My mother really loves tea
He has a lot of creative ideas
I quit smoking a year ago
Iron directs heat well enough
This is the taste of victory
My sister started crying
I need to vent my anger
You must be starving
It was nothing but eyewash
You made a fool of yourself
These books are yours
A man like me needs a hat
She needs to come
Nobody encouraged him
He is having dinner
He left his children
I want to try again
He loves soccer
He likes soccer a lot
Too many knives
Even a child knows that
Even children know that
They want my death
Lubomir loves his mom
He is greedy and lazy
We must pay taxes
He speaks Portuguese
That flag is very nice
That flag is very pretty
That flag is very beautiful
He darkens the room
She puts the children to bed
She puts the boys to bed
She puts the children to sleep
She puts the boys to sleep
Wait a bit longer
Wait a little longer
We must leave right away
I am searching for my brother
We are not alone
He improved the device
She is really a nice girl
She is really a good girl
She is a really good girl
City life suits me very well
My card is charged
His goal is not to earn money
His goal is to not earn money
This is your final warning
He found her irresistible
Everything is copacetic
I just brewed a pot
It was an immediate success
It snowed in Jerusalem
It makes no fucking sense
It is hard to speak in public
She likes fairy tales
Stability is in unity
He wanted to flatter me
She wanted to flatter me
That serves him right
It was a great loss for me
They are hand in glove
He and I are the same age
John has gone cuckoo
I need to talk to him
She did pretty well
I watched it on YouTube
I watched it on Dailymotion
I mean no disrespect
I know your face
Go kiss an orc
I need to go
I must go
Your head is empty
Come near the fire
I would like to have dinner
I would like to have lunch
I would like to have breakfast
I forgot to sent her an email
He looks just like his brother
I need ten of them
I am annoyed by your egotism
I only used it once
I will prepare a little tea
Tell Tom that I am ready
Make everyone feel at ease
I had never seen it
The train is about to arrive
I am waiting for the bus
I am waiting for the train
Do not be absurd
You are deceiving yourself
I still have to run errands
It was anything but pleasant
I tried to remove all doubt
This is very typical for you
There is fame and fortune lost
No one can resist
That gives one a horse laugh
You can depend on it
That does not bode well
The best was yet to come
He went on singing
He is having coffee now
Tom got scared
She lives alone in this room
The French are often wrong
We have to close the window
He went on with his list
It really is your fault
We are eating breakfast inside
He stood stock still
He was frozen to the spot
John was born in the US
We rushed out onto the street
We get on very well
We have better things to do
It is very small
The new furniture came today
I love my work very much
I love my work a lot
The house always wins
John left home in a hurry
They got the prize
I made a bet
I went to the room
Choose the lesser of two evils
He lives in a closed community
I saw a strange lady there
They are six people
I want it with a lot of ice
Pace down
Return it when you are done
Now you are an adult
I am a married man
We keep in touch
My grandmother cooked for five
The girl looked ill
She is shameless
The park was crowded
I will join you
He looks like a sick person
This will be thirty Euros
He is probably still alive
She has no one to talk to
I will examine your report
This man is very humble
She trusted me
Now I want to speak Esperanto
I think this guy is serious
I met her again
Something is going on
The cup was empty
I consider Tom a friend
The right riverside is steep
I am going back to town
I love snow
We rented out a canoe
That belongs to us
I felt dazed when I got up
Drunkards drink non stop
She looked at me and laughed
They stayed awake all night
There is no escape from fate
That disc cost ten dollars
Prussian is a Baltic language
He has no reason to be late
Put the book there
He felt perfectly content
I know what you were doing
Somebody saw you
I saw somebody
The water was five feet deep
He froze in his tracks
He almost died
She just told me
I never eat before breakfast
All that Jack does is sleep
You only gave me fifty cents
Please spell your name
He shaves every day
I feel powerless
He deserves to know the truth
He says he likes flowers
John has a car from Japan
He became a hobo
Her voice grew soft
You almost killed Tom
The meat is roasting
I have written a letter
The result was worth zero
Your proposal sounds good
There used to be a bath
Thank you
I love cheese
Words cannot describe it
He gave me a penetrating gaze
Words could not describe it
Please lend me your dictionary
Please loan me your dictionary
Tom should have paid Mary
Experience pays off
It is similar
He forgot to feed the dog
I have a tomcat
We climbed a steep slope
She is gone shopping
We need to win
We really need to win
Bring your best game
Calm your nerves down
Calm your nerves
You could hear a pin drop
Do not attempt this at home
You have to stay fit
You have to keep fit
You have to stay in shape
The girl was quick as a flash
Learn a language for free
The thing still bothers me
The cat maimed three squirrels
I need to take medications
They are eating just now
He is an excellent speaker
I know where Tom was born
We went clay pigeon shooting
It was not an easy decision
She surprised me
I have no experience
We were all shocked
The teacher was angry with me
The tables have turned
The blind leading the blind
I am nineteen years old
I adore your hands
I was fortunate to see that
Nobody helped her
Someone is playing the piano
I was frustrated
Skip the boring chapters
All swans are white
This swan is black
What you know cannot hurt you
You lack imagination
You look wonderful
She has good sense
He never laughs at my jokes
He never laughs
I miss my mom
This is fucked up
I want to see you in my office
Your parents loved us
It was an incredible place
Mount Fuji is extraordinary
He finished all of the exams
Everyone can be mistaken
His heart sank to his boots
He means it seriously
The village needs your help
Cost what it may
Short and sweet
Liisa accused me of negligence
She does not let up
His crime is unforgivable
I do not know that lady
I was flabbergasted
He needs assistants
She needs assistants
Women talk nonstop
It snows in Paris
You heard correctly
She had reached her goal
She had achieved her objective
The old lady got off the bus
This guy looks like a fox
He confessed to the murder
The tree leaves turned red
Medicine
He always forgets his money
I need it today
I must hurry
Think outside the box
She is a strumpet
She is a harlot
She is a doxy
The secret was spread
Everything comes at a price
Liisa eschews public attention
He is not to be trifled with
It dawns on me
Damacus is located in Syria
Nothing daunts her
He held a ball
Beware of thieves
Tom is leading Mary astray
I thought you hated me
I was happy to see her
His request is as follows
This is sick
This still applies to him
I got dealt a bad hand
I live in Kazakhstan
You missed a spot
I had to drag him out of bed
She slowly lost hope
Life is a bitch
I hate this job
I ran outside
Mary wasted no time
My dad gave up alcohol
Enjoy your day
Crime is down
I like the way you think
God or nature
School sucks
Airplanes land at airports
Criminals should be punished
Help me for just a minute
I am so sick
I speak for all people
I suppose you are right
I will go if you go
It is their right to vote
Swimming is a form of exercise
That man is a soldier
The book costs five dollars
The book fell to the floor
The book is on the table
The path is direct
The room was dark
The talks should begin soon
The talks will last three days
These shoes fit my feet
They believe in God
They formed a swim team
They may leave tomorrow
They plan to have a party
They will hold talks tomorrow
Water power turns the wheel
We have only two dollars
We should study
You must go to school
She complains all the time
Tom is a kisser
They cancelled the festival
Tom and Mary have two cats
One must not break his promise

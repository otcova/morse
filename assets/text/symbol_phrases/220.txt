You're very flirtatious
That's what it is all about
I'm no longer starving
The details aren't necessary
Why don't you leave, Tom?
I'm on friendly terms with her
He's closer
I'd better scoot
Free Caucasus!
Let's cut the crap
You didn't say a word
I'm like drenched in sweat
Let's all help Tom
Dance with her!
Tom didn't buy bread
You should apologize to her.
Definitely not!
Your dog ate my homework.
Definitely not!
Tom, you have a call!
When did you travel to Rome?
Don't be gross
Shouldn't we ask Tom?
Could I pay via Mastercard?
I'm saving up for my old age
I guess it's not true
I guess I'll never know
I guess I'm in big trouble
I guess it's pretty cool
I guess Tom's not particular
Everything's different now
Our tour guide's name was Tom
This isn't a handout
Can you handle the truth?
Can Tom handle the pressure?
I'm still hanging in there
May I open the curtain?
Can I open the curtain?
Nice to meet all of you!
How can I add these sentences?
Why are you always laughing?
She's a square
That's happening far too often
That never happened, of course
It won't just happen overnight
I hope this won't happen again
You never know what'll happen
What happened can't be undone
We've seen that happen before
Tom wasn't sure what happened
That's why it hasn't happened
That's not what happened here
I think it won't happen again
What's likely to happen next?
What's happened to the money?
What happened isn't a secret
What happened in the meeting?
We're sorry that it happened
That's happened to me before
That won't happen again soon
It's not happening right now
It's funny how things happen
I'm not sure how it happened
I think that's what happened
You can't help what happens
Why is this happening again?
What's likely to happen now?
That's what usually happens
That's what needs to happen
That won't happen this time
That won't happen on Monday
I'm sorry for what happened
I'm glad it's happening now
What happened to the money?
We see that it's happening
That's what happened to me
It won't happen right away
I've seen it happen before
Why is it still happening?
Tom is sure it'll happen
It's never happened to me
That hasn't yet happened
That's unlikely to happen
Is that likely to happen?
What's likely to happen?
What happened last week?
Let's see if it happens
What's happening today?
Look what's happened
It's likely to happen
It'll happen soon
Apparently you're right
May I go buy some ice cream?
Can I go buy some ice cream?
You shouldn't have to do that
I didn't have to pay
I didn't have to do anything
Tom said you wouldn't go
Where are you, Charles?
Well, nobody is perfect!
Please don't shout
What does PTA mean?
Embrace life!
Are you ready for spring?
Crimea is Ukraine!
Was there an affair?
Do you know the movie Avatar?
How many Santas are there?
Why are you still up?
Now I am happy!
That's just what you need now
Unfortunately, that is true
I won't do it myself
I can't tell them apart
There's no magic bullet
Ami, what are you doing?
Mary is a stay-at-home mom
I'll get hungry
I'll be hungry
I won't ask why you want that
Mary's nose was bleeding
I'm rarely invited to parties
Do you have a big family?
Can you hear the cat?
She's wanting in
Do you have a large family?
Is Tom nearby?
Be satisfied!
Napoleon's horse was white
Let's discuss your idea
Let's discuss this over lunch
Let's discuss our options
Let's not discuss this now
You look very pretty, as usual
Where did you find that dress?
We knew Tom wouldn't be late
That's an exception
Why did Dan kill himself?
Don't smoke so much
Don't smoke so heavily
I'll find the money somehow
What goes well with potatoes?
I'm sorry
I shouldn't have said that
Where can I ride a motorcycle?
How much is my fare?
I don't know what to do
I'm just following her
Tom loves his daughter's face
It's all I could find
You're too cynical
Don't bite my head off
Can I make you some eggs?
Where do you train?
You'll be fine with me
We'll sort it out later
Are you desperate for company?
I'm broke
You'll stay out of it
You hear me?
How far along is she pregnant?
We're taking it slow
We've got better plans for you
You'll be gorgeous
I've done a little hunting
How are we going to get by?
What's the harm in that?
They probably hate me, too
Tom probably hates me, too
I've heard that many times
That's really nice to hear
Tom hasn't been heard from
I've heard this joke before
I haven't heard anything yet
Why do you want to deceive me?
Don't try to force me!
Could you talk to him for me?
Could you talk to her for me?
How do you like your coffee?
That is how I like it.
Could you talk to Tom for me?
Would you talk to Tom for me?
I'll talk to Tom about this
Can I help you, sir?
How can we help out?
How may we help you?
Is Tom helping Mary?
Will I get any help?
It's been a great help
Here, I'll help you out
How can you really help?
I'd better help Tom out
Let's see if this helps
We're ready to help out
We're ready to help you
Will I receive any help?
Thanks for your help, Tom
We're always here to help
Who have you helped lately?
You've been really helpful
They're only trying to help
Who have you helped recently?
Sometimes I can't help myself
And he calls himself a sniper!
It's not your fault
Where did you eat lunch?
I ate at a restaurant.
Where did you have lunch?
At a restaurant.
I don't want to be cruel
She's so beautiful
Where are fitting rooms?
Damn, Jackson!
We're hoping that's not true
Let's hope Tom stays healthy
I'm secretly hoping for that
Let's hope Tom is listening
That's what I'm hoping for
We're hoping for the best
I hope that's good enough
I really hope I'm wrong
I hope this isn't true
I hope that isn't true
Let's never lose hope
Hopefully, we'll win
Honest, my ass!
Sorry, I don't follow
Tell us what you think!
There's not enough time
Mom, I dropped my toy
Can you get it for me?
Don't push my buttons
I can't take it anymore!
We're not friends
We're acquaintances
Do you want them?
Tom and I aren't friends
We're just coworkers
Why did Tom kill himself?
But—" "Now!
I'll go—" "Shut up!
You shut up first!
Guess again!
Bye, Link.
Where are you going?
And, Link?
'Sup?
I love you.
I know.
Heh.
Hey, Zelda!
What's up?
Nothing, Link.
You sure?
I think you wanna kiss, huh?
I think not.
That's just a nonsense word
It doesn't mean anything
There's little novel about it
I don't want to be like that
Don't go for a walk naked!
Who's the fastest one here?
That's what I'm hoping
I study sometimes!
We don't have much time
Could I have some sugar?
Come on, let's play
I'm from Budapest
When is the ship leaving?
Do you know who Tom killed?
There's a fog on the road
I'm here
What do you want?
Are you going back now?
I don't like rainy weather
I'm Argentinian
What the hell is this?
Don't be late to school
I'm used to no-one liking me
I like the 4th one.
I'm used to no one liking me
Why does everything go wrong?
What do they call him?
Oh no!
He fell down!
Are you guys doing well?
Is it really true?!
Are you for real?!
Is your homework done?
Is your homework finished?
Hopefully, that's not the case
Hopefully, we'll see Tom today
Where are you hiding now?
Are there any hidden fees?
What else are they hiding?
Where has Tom been hiding?
I'm not hiding from anybody
I'm not holding my breath
I'm not angry, just hurt
You can't hurt me anymore
What do they call her?
What do they call it?
What do they say for this?
I'm not sure where Tom is
I'm glad that Tom is here
I'm not moving to Boston
I'm trying my best here
I'm really sick of this
I'm not ashamed of that
I'm kind of new at this
I'm just taking my time
I'm just not very happy
I'm good at many things
I'm all alone right now
I'm actually a nice guy
I'm a pretty honest guy
I'm very proud of that
I'm very happy with it
I'm sure they need you
I'm scared for my kids
I'm real proud of that
I'm proud of this team
I'm proud of my family
I'm not worried at all
I'm not talking to Tom
I'm not married to Tom
I'm not mad at anybody
I'm not at all worried
I'm not a night person
I'm glad we were there
I'm glad people saw it
I'm focusing on my job
I'm a pretty lucky guy
I'm a big football fan
I'm sure Tom is proud
I'm sad to be leaving
I'm real proud of Tom
I'm proud of our team
I'm on the honor roll
I'm not here for that
I'm not happy with it
I'm not bitter at all
I'm not a wealthy man
I'm not a bad student
I'm kind of into that
I'm glad that Tom won
I'm anxious to see it
I'm a real simple guy
I'm a bit worried now
I'm scared of snakes
I'm ready to respond
I'm not used to that
I'm not lying to you
I'm not always right
I'm happy about that
I'm glad you replied
I'm glad Tom is here
I'm quite happy now
I'm not rich enough
I'm not ready to go
I'm a sound sleeper
I'm a little bummed
I'm used to it now
I'm having a blast
I'm proud of that
I'm not the owner
I'm not a veteran
I'm happy we won
I'm glad Tom won
I'm glad we won
I'm not picky
I'm a purist
That sucks, guys!
Where have you been?
I've been waiting all night
Let's get to work!
Let's get down to work!
Where is Interlingua spoken?
That's what the doctor ordered
You've taught me so much
You can't sit next to me
You can't sit with me
What if I'm right?
What if I'm wrong?
We're both rich
Suddenly, a dog began to bark
That's what Tom tells me
That's music to my ears
Could you dust off the table?
My suitcase isn't packed yet
My life's been good
My father's name is Tom
Don't worry
Everything's under control
Fabergé eggs are very valuable
It's what I'm used to
It's what I'm used to doing
It's too smoky here for me
It's too smoky in here for me
It's too noisy here for me
It's not up to me
It wasn't easy for me
What is your favourite number?
With great pleasure!
I will be thirty-five in June
Tom had flu-like symptoms
You're not paying attention
I'm firmly opposed to this
Human's nature scares me
Why did you delete my number?
How much will I receive?
How can I protect myself?
How can I overcome this?
Here's what I think
Have you seen my dog?
Have you seen me dance?
Can I try one more?
Can I try doing it once more?
Can I still return this?
Tom won't know I'm here
The government is corrupt!
Follow that car!
I've learned so much from you
I'll definitely vote for Tom
I've made that same mistake
I've made some poor choices
I've lost your phone number
I've learned a lot from you
I've learned a lot from Tom
I've never met Tom, either
I've met Tom several times
I've been here three years
I'll be here all afternoon
I've lived here for years
I've learned how to relax
I've also lived in Boston
I've just figured it out
I'll be here all morning
I, too, have a question
I've never had a cavity
I've made a big mistake
I've just worked it out
I'll be ready next time
I'll be ready by Monday
I'd rather go to Boston
I'd rather be in Boston
I wonder if that's true
I won't comment on that
I've lived a long life
I've lived a good life
I've had enough of Tom
I'll have to work hard
I'll be voting for Tom
I've seen a lot worse
I've been on vacation
I've always been fast
I'll be here all week
I'd like to stay here
I've learned so much
I've been very lucky
I'll try to be quick
I'll miss all of you
I'll be here all day
I won't vote for Tom
I won't support that
I've met Tom before
I've learned a lot
I wish it weren't so
I wish I'd written that
I wasn't told the truth
I wasn't told the reason
I wasn't raised that way
I wasn't mad at Tom
Please adopt this sentence!
Have a pleasant weekend!
I know I'm good enough
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not good enough
I know I'm very lucky
I know it's a surprise
I know it's still there
I know that it's there
I know that's my ticket
I know this isn't right
I know Tom can't wait
I know you'll be brave
I know you'll be happy here
That's right
Oh no..
It won't fit under the counter
This cooktop is 44 inches wide
They've recently patched WoW
Wanna farm the new dungeon?
Pweh!
Pweh!
It looks like she's Russian
Communists don't worship money
Did Google ban you?
Can I see your ticket?
Drop by sometime!
He lives in his aunt's house
We'll never know the reason
I can't improve on this
I can't see Tom tonight
I can't see you tonight
I can't talk about this
I hadn't seen it before
I haven't read it yet
I haven't seen that happen yet
I'm happy for you both
I'm not an astrologer
Don't scratch it
Are you able to keep walking?
Where is there a bakery?
I haven't yet read the report
I haven't read the report yet
I just think it's wrong
I knew that wasn't true
I left Tom in 2013
I like Tom's idea
I really liked Tom, too
I think I'm pretty lucky
I think it'd be fun
I think it's a fad
I think it's a miracle
I think it's a shame
I think it's all wrong
I think it's good enough
I think it's great
I think it's nice, too
I think it's only fair
I think it's our mistake
I think it's real nice
I think it's really cool
I think it's really ugly
I think it's still there
I think it's that simple
I think it's Tom's fault
I think that's Tom's goal
I think that's true
I think that's unlikely
I think that's what it is
I think this isn't fair
I think this one's better
I think Tom isn't right
I think Tom isn't serious
I think we're ready
I think you'll be fine
I think you're selfish
I thought I'd be fine
I told Tom he's crazy
I was here in 2013
I was very, very happy
I'll be away till Christmas
I'll be meeting with Tom
I'll be there till 2:30
I'll be waiting for you here
I'll carry as much as I can
I'll really miss Tom
I'll take whatever I can
I'm a little bit nervous
I'm a real simple person
I'm grateful to be alive
I'm happy that it's over
I'm much better now
I'm not exactly sure why
I'm not happy about that
I'm pretty happy with it
I'm pretty proud of that
I'm really proud of that
I couldn't help but follow her
Where are we going to meet?
Pass me the sugar, please
Is the person good?
I'm only pulling your leg
I'm scared of Tom's dog
I'm still upset about it
I'm toying with the idea
I'm very glad about that
I'm very grateful for that
I'm very mindful of that
I'm very pleased with it
I'm very proud of myself
I've been here twice now
What time will you be leaving?
Where did the tragedy occur?
Wear a coat - it's cold out!
If he likes me, then he's good
What is the square root of 67?
That's the right attitude
Who's Tatoeba?
Your new girlfriend?
Who's Tom?
Is he your new boyfriend?
It's like tilting at windmills
You've been spying on me
That's what I'm proud of
That's my job, not Tom's
That's all I worry about
Please wait until I'm ready
Please tell me I'm right
It sounds simple, I know
I've seen Tom dance many times
I've seen enough for now
I've never regretted it
I've had so much support
I've already written to Tom
I'm really not sure
I'm not really that sorry
I'm not like anybody else
I'm named after my father
I'm here to play baseball
I'm disgusted by all this
I'm a responsible person
I'll pray for your family
I wish I'd thought of that
I wasn't worried about it
I wasn't raised like that
I wasn't nervous about it
I wasn't interested in it
I wasn't confident at all
I think they're wrong
I know it's illegal
I can't wait until Monday
I can't wait for tomorrow
I can't resist any longer
I can't even imagine that
Have I taught you nothing?
What a nice house!
What was I worrying about?
Were you talking about me?
We've been lucky, I think
Tom isn't a baby anymore
They aren't mine
That's not really my job
My car wasn't good enough
It wasn't important to me
I've been wrong before
Drink a tea with me!
Have some tea with me!
This pen doesn't work
I've been praying for you
I'm working on my project
I'm very sorry about this
I'm very happy about that
I'm trying to be cautious
I'm tired of your whining
I'm taking my time
I'm sure Tom would rather stay
I'm sure Tom owns property
I'm sure it was a coincidence
I'm still looking into it
I'm still around
I'm siding with Tom
I'm sick of the hypocrisy
I'm really upset about it
I'm really happy to be here
I'm really happy I'm here
I'm really happy about it
I'm quite shocked by this
I'm only a freshman
What did both of you do?
What did you both do?
Don't go in that room
Don't enter that room
I'm not worried that much
I'm not upset anymore
I'm not too upset anymore
I'm not thinking about it
I'm not surprised one bit
I'm not sure actually
I'm glad Tom left
I won't tell anybody else
I wasn't too surprised
I thought I'd been stabbed
How I suffer!
Don't faint!
I can see you're speechless
Don't let on I'm here
Do you talk about us?
I said no!
I'm a cocaine exporter
They don't speak English
They don't know English
What year was your car made?
I don't like to be judged
Of course, Tom loves his kids
May I borrow the hair dryer?
Let's telephone him
We won't let you die
We won't let you pass away
I'd like to tell you the truth
Clearly, it's a fraud
I can't bear this kind of pain
Is it pleasing to you?
What's that restaurant's name?
Excuse me, what queue is this?
Excuse me, may I have a spoon?
You don't look very well
Are you OK?
You don't look very well
Are you sick?
I think that's a possibility
I think it's doable
I think it's a possibility
I probably won't watch this
He's a dunce
I'm fed up with him!
I'm tired of him!
I'm sick of him!
I'm sick of all the complaints
Would you like a little?
Sorry, Jorge!
I didn't see you!
This is Tom's chair
I'm only a newbie
She's very busy on Friday
Don't come to the meeting!
I got you on camera!
Me too," Ganon appeared next
Give me that!
For the lulz!
The lulz!
Stop it, stop the uploading!
Please, PLEASE!
The square root of 2 is not 1
What is the square root of 2?
You know what you know!
You know, I like how you talk
Come on, Berdych hardly choked
It's not a bug
It's a feature, not a bug
The truth doesn't always win
Don't tell him that I'm here
Quit while you're ahead
It's ten past four now
We don't want to hear about it
Have you finished?
No, I haven't even started.
Have you finished?
I haven't even started.
He's late
Kitty, you are my ditty
I don't live in Helsinki
I'm not even going to watch it
Oh man!
What would you like to learn?
I say I'm not guilty
Will anybody else come?
They can be understood, too
That's junk
He's in love with that girl
I'm not ignoring them
You're embarrassing me
Is there anything else to eat?
I always forget people's names
It wasn't there last year
I'm in a pretty pickle
Don't know
Did Thomas get sick?
Does he speak Hungarian too?
Does she speak Hungarian too?
We're trying to close the box
You'll probably see me again
Why's everyone looking at me?
What I think isn't important
These aren't my ideas
That's what worrying me
Thanks a lot!
That's what really scares me
That's what I'm focused on
That's very important to me
That's the problem, I think
That's one of my weaknesses
That's not really my thing
That's all I'm looking for
Perhaps I've been wrong
What's your marital status?
I must've eaten something bad
I've lived here for 30 years
Some didn't want to discuss
Sorry, I can't do that
Well, I think it's interesting
There's no place I'd rather be
It's part of my responsibility
I've never noticed that before
I've met some wonderful people
I've been everywhere in Europe
I've always liked those people
I'm very optimistic about this
I'm sure it wasn't intentional
I'm sure I'm missing something
I'm probably spending more now
I'm not saying anybody's lying
I'm not exaggerating, you know
I'm looking towards the future
I'm from around here, actually
I'm definitely a little better
I wonder what they're planning
I don't often watch TV anymore
I definitely think it's doable
Obviously, I was very shocked
I've already had many chances
I think that's probably right
I think that's pretty obvious
I like Tom's aggressive style
Actually, that's why I'm here
I'm reasonably certain of it
I'm not sure that's suitable
I'm not looking for anything
I'm like everybody else here
I'm familiar with Tom's work
I'm actually a little afraid
I'll never leave early again
I'll definitely look into it
I think that's pretty stupid
I think it's absolutely fine
I know that's real important
I know it's pretty important
I just can't understand this
Hardly anyone knows I'm here
My family has suffered, too
It's me they're waiting for
It's exactly what I thought
I've never said that before
I've never had that problem
I've been really happy here
I've always loved Christmas
I'm really angry about this
I'm real impressed with Tom
I'm quite worried about Tom
I'm probably a lot like you
I'm pretty interested in it
I'm not the least surprised
I'm not saying that's wrong
I'm deeply offended by this
I'm confident in my ability
I'm being patient right now
I think they're working now
I think that's pretty funny
I think it's very important
I think it's very difficult
I know that it's inevitable
I haven't worked since then
Maybe I'm working too much
I've been very, very lucky
I'm well ahead of schedule
I'm very thankful for that
I'm very positive about it
I'm sure it's inconvenient
I'm sorry, I misunderstood
I'm really happy with that
I'm pretty sure that's Tom
I'm perfectly fine with it
I'm perfectly OK with that
I'm not motivated by money
I'm not impressed with Tom
I'm friends with the owner
I'll probably use it again
I'll definitely look at it
I'd never seen that before
I won't mention that again
I wasn't really having fun
I understand you're scared
I just can't understand it
I haven't thought about it
I haven't spoken to anyone
I'm taking classes online
I'm pretty normal, really
I'm extremely overwhelmed
I'm a pretty stubborn guy
I'd prefer not to do that
I've rented an apartment
I've always been healthy
I'm really, really sorry
I'm extremely interested
I'll definitely miss you
I think it's appropriate
I've never noticed that
I've already had dinner
I'm not very interested
I'm not being sarcastic
It's almost my bedtime
I've been fairly lucky
I'm pretty progressive
I'm absolutely furious
I'm a little squeamish
I wasn't eavesdropping
I trust Tom's judgment
How heavy is too heavy?
That isn't a new idea
I'm not superstitious
I'm just being myself
I'm fairly optimistic
I'm always optimistic
I think it's horrible
I'm still not scared
I'm pretty confident
I'm not exaggerating
I'm not an alcoholic
I'm definitely ready
I'm actually shocked
I'll pass that along
I think it's perfect
How cold is too cold?
I'm very optimistic
I'm pretty stubborn
I'm never satisfied
I wasn't having fun
How shall I proceed?
Why's Tom so angry?
Things aren't easy
They're great kids
Just how big is it?
It's very valuable
It's very tempting
It's really unfair
It's now up to you
It's fairly unique
It's all new to me
Is it a nice place?
I wasn't penalized
How hot is too hot?
How far is too far?
That's really bad
Is Tom a nice guy?
I'm tired of that
I'm still worried
Why's it our job?
Is Tom a bad guy?
I'm very shocked
I'm very pleased
I'm pretty lucky
I'm pretty angry
Good, enough poetic images
Who can be sure?
It's very upsetting
It's very rewarding
It's very different
It's pretty obvious
It's no fun to lose
It's different here
It's a bad omen
It'll be fun to see Tom again
It'll be a nice day
It'll be a good day
It wasn't a bad day
Is that what it was?
Is that fair to you?
How much is the tax?
How lazy can you be?
How cold is it here?
How can we stop Tom?
How bad is the need?
Here's a new one
It's terribly hot this morning
Didn't I say it was a trick?
To us!
Do you eat breakfast at home?
However, do good
Why are we poor?
Tom says he's OK
Tom says he's fine
So what is the plan?
Tom is 30 years old
Was it all worth it?
We won't let you in
What else can it be?
Why is Tom so weird?
You know it's a lie
Tom has seen it, too
You know that's a lie
Tom says he's feeling OK
There's no need to be nasty
Don't be stingy with the tip
I think they're happy
I'm giving you what you want
That's complicating the matter
It's fashion!
Tell everyone you're drunk
I'm looking for a place to sit
How much worse is it?
How much is Tom worth?
How much is it worth?
How much can you pay?
How much can we take?
How can this be real?
How can they stop us?
How bad is it really?
Now, we exact justice
He called his sister, Mary
This isn't the only key
Who am I to criticize him?
I'm not denouncing you
How much is your rent?
How heavy are you?
How fast can you walk?
Here's how to use it
Here's a short list
Have you used it yet?

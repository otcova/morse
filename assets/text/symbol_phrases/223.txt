That's what we've always used
That's what we're looking for
That's what we always thought
That's what it's really worth
That's plain enough, isn't it?
That's not the important part
That's just good common sense
That's basically what we want
That's apparently not a crime
That's a very simple question
That's a very optimistic view
That's a very different thing
That's a good point, actually
That's a common attitude here
That wasn't a good experience
Sorry, it's not your decision
Are you sure she can do it?
Now, let's see some enthusiasm
It's not a permanent solution
It's not a difficult question
It's a very important message
It's a very chaotic situation
It'll only make matters worse
It'll be interesting for sure
It'll be a difficult decision
Is French your first language?
Has anyone thought about this?
Has anyone thought about that?
Everything's been easy for us
Are they really any different?
There's really no difference
That's what's most important
Perhaps it's not that simple
What surprised you the most?
We're about the same weight
Why was everyone surprised?
Why is insurance important?
Who exactly is responsible?
It's worth thinking about
Do you know sign language?
Let's take another vote
It's hard to ignore Tom
Have you registered yet?
That isn't the problem
Everyone's having fun
It's worth talking about
Something's really weird here
That must've been surprising
We've practiced long enough
The situation isn't perfect
Maybe there's no difference
Experts say that's unlikely
That's extremely dangerous
It's really hard to choose
That isn't very important
Everybody's really angry
It's very, very hot here
It's still a great story
It's quite a simple idea
There's someone missing
Let's not panic now
I don't miss Tom
Can Tom join you?
Understood?
You'll probably need some help
We've had a difficult schedule
This isn't really anything new
They're a good basketball team
They aren't ready for anything
That was Tom's biggest mistake
Maybe there isn't a difference
It's really hard to comprehend
It's makes absolutely no sense
It's important to have courage
Everybody's a little different
He's really weird
Could I get another quilt?
Quit clowning around!
I'm going to cut down on meat
I've got to pack for the trip
They can't handle reality
Listen up, students!
Who's really good in German?
What is it that bothers you?
I know, your busy too
I didn't dream in the night
I can't meet you
It won't budge one bit
How do you make this soup?
Can you eat this?
Tom's got a sore throat
(Do you) need my help at all?
I don't know English at all
Who wanted what?
Do you know what I did?
Do you know what I see here?
How long will you be away?
Do you have a mother?
Does he have a mother?
Does she have a mother?
Is his mother still living?
Is her mother still living?
Tom is a pig!
Do only what I did!
Is your mother still living?
Are your parents still living?
I'm heading towards Boston now
I'll come tomorrow morning
I don't know French at all
I've almost finished my work
I'd really like to go there
I'll stop if you stop
If you need me to, I'll come
If she'd just come!
What if you did do it?
I'll drink tea, if I can
If you're hungry, eat
There are few mistakes, if any
If need be, I'll go with you
I don't know if he'll come
He's really an oddball
In fact, I don't like him
That doesn't look good at all
Hello, can I speak with Mauro?
Yes, who's calling?
You're treading on thin ice
You've eaten enough
I've learned many lessons
Can you call for help?
Be patient!
What needs to be discussed?
Wrong! - or no?
Correct!
I'm a jinx
Can you lean forward a bit?
Are you going to marry her?
Are you going to marry him?
Are you going to marry him?
No, I'm not.
What do you find so amusing?
Do you want to come?
That's where the magic happens
Did you kiss?
You know I can't stand him
You know I can't stand her
That's not very elegant
It's too late to get out now
Do you want to become famous?
You're scary!
Don't leave it till tomorrow
Döner makes you more beautiful
Love doesn't obey anyone
I'm still doing a test
I didn't sleep well yesterday
Sir, we're ready to order
You'll repent at the cross
Could you use some help?
I'll drive her
She'll be driven by me
Such a clunker!
What will we do if he's late?
If he's tired, he should sleep
Who smashed the window?
I'll loan you one if you want
Then why are you crying?
If so, then what do we do?
Honestly, it helps me a lot
I'll go if the weather is nice
I'm a redhead
What on earth?
Then why have you sold it?
What did Tom find?
Think about your brother!
Keep it secret!
Actually, we waste water
Tom can't be a poet
When will Mary get back home?
Don't go there alone
Do you want one of them?
We aren't late
Tom won't be thirsty
Die by the sword!
If a = b and b = c, then a = c
Be embraced you millions!
You've got to work really hard
You aren't our friend
The store is closing at 7
There are 30 people in the bus

Who owns that house?
What color is your house?
Are you English?
Are you Ukrainian?
Did you ring him yesterday?
She doesn't like me
I'd love to see her
Tom still hasn't tied the knot
Ah, I forgot to ask
Have you found it since?
Tom came on Mary's tits
Tom came on Mary's boobs
Who was punished?
Is your friend still sleeping?
I can't walk in the sun
Were my letters sent?
Was my letter sent?
Are you here to negotiate?
I don't like that store
Confess right now!
Let's stay here
You're not invincible
Are you sure you're okay?
Tom is a self-centered jerk
Who taught you this?
Can we talk after class?
I don't like the cats
Where did you learn to write?
That's not how the world works
I don't care about being cool
Fortunately, I don't buy it
Fortunately, I'm not buying it
You didn't help me
I'll never help you

Who is sleeping in my bed?
Yeah, was there an earthquake?
You didn't understand!
Mary's dog bit me
Mary's dog bit Tom
When will you leave for Tokyo?
Don't think

Do you know Tom and Mary?
Can I ask Tom about that?
I'm departing this evening
Will you help?
But what is it?
Why did you give him money?
Do you want to learn to paint?
Don't just stand
Pose!
Why did you give Tom money?
What's making you so busy?
They weren't afraid
He's always learning something
He's eight as of yesterday
Are we mortal or immortal?
You're getting ready
Why are you waiting in line?
Be careful!
Can you wait ten minutes?
There's no other solution
I'm going to behead you
Tom's arm must be amputated
Do that!
Don't drive!
Is it Friday?
Is there another solution?
Where is Julia?
I can't handle it
I can't help that
I couldn't buy it
I didn't buy that
I didn't feel bad
I didn't know Tom
I didn't say much
I didn't see much
I didn't touch it
I don't deny this
I don't know much
I hope that you'll come back
I hope you'll come back
I think it's good
I won't negotiate
I'll never change
I'll vote for you

I've enjoyed it
Today's been a difficult day
I don't have to listen to that
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you
Where has the time gone?
After you had left, he came
Why do you always butt in?
Wine makes man's heart happy
Use your brain!
It's a very difficult question
He's putting himself in debt
Can she cycle?
Can she ride a bike?
What's the plan for tomorrow?
The cost is $300
We're behind you
We're firing you
You're all wrong
Tom's plan isn't working
We've got to win
We're closing up
That's so untrue
We're all unique
Why does my dog hate Tom?
We're fine today
That's a waste of time
What fun is that?
Why does Tom stay?
This isn't scary
That's an option
We're still open
This can't go on
We're not normal
This isn't music
That's a waste of money
That's our money
We're both men
Why is Tom afraid of Mary?
We're just lucky
We've done a lot
That's just life
That's state law
What'll we do if Tom is late?
That's a big kid
What a sick joke!
That's not a job
Tom says he didn't do it
We didn't buy it
What can Tom do about it?
When will Tom get back home?
We're very happy
That wasn't good
Well, here we go
They're so funny
That's all folks
You're all fired
You're just fine
We're so excited
What would we do?
That's all we do
That's what I do
Who's in control?
I've made my choice
We're all adults
We're not active
Don't be a victim
Wow, you're on the front page!
Stop fighting, you two!
Stop using my stuff!
Did Tom just leave?
She doesn't want forgiveness
I swear I wasn't there
I admire Tom's dedication
How come you're late?
Where is your homework?
You're writing
What will I do in Paris?
What will I do in Rome?
Does your back still hurt?
That is Tom's perfume?
Tom isn't very religious
Tom hasn't been replaced
Do you think that I'm sad?
It is my curse, I suppose
I'm afraid of my mother
I'm afraid of my boss
I can't eat that food
What does he want me to do?
What does she want me to do?
What did they say first?
What are you asking us?
What did you request from him?
What are you asking me?
Where did you learn to read?
Why is your wife sad?
Mary says she's innocent
They all say they're innocent
Why are you beating me?
Why do you beat your children?
He's afraid of his father
I'm missing you
Where the hell are you?
Where the hell did I put it?
Which textbook are you using?
I'll never be late again
Here is Mary's dog
Do they have a dictionary?
Where is the ship?
You're learning, right?
We're learning
Tom didn't sound worried
Tom doesn't speak French well
Tom didn't want these
Tom doesn't believe that
Tom didn't even smile
Tom didn't understand it
Tom didn't mean to do it
Tom didn't have to do it
Tom probably doesn't care
Tom didn't miss anything
I've been alone all my life
I'm not satisfied with you
Did you use toilet paper?
I'm asking your opinion
I don't know who this man is
I don't know where you are now
I'm well today
Hiya, kiddo!
Some people don't like chicken
Act, instead of talking
I didn't shoot Tom
I followed Tom's advice
I wish Tom hadn't done that
I'm a lot nicer than Tom
Is Tom a good son-in-law?
Is Tom really a nice guy?
It won't be easy for Tom
I'm not arresting you
And where do you want to sit?
What did you say again?
Let's begin!
Do they have a bicycle?
I don't understand Portuguese
Does he have a bicycle?
Does she have a bicycle?
I am Thomas's cousin
She'll get married soon
Can you go look for help?
Who benefits?
Happiness was short-lived
I'm not choosing them
How did she get in here?
Tom doesn't buy bread
Tom isn't buying bread
Do you like the white wine?
How did you become a cop?
I don't usually do that
What does Tom read?
When will the train arrive?
While you play, I read
I almost didn't do that
I can't fight this
I can't handle this
I can't lose weight
I can't study here
I could've done that
I couldn't handle it
I didn't drink much
I didn't feel safe
I didn't hit anybody
I didn't know anybody there
I didn't need this
I didn't read that
I didn't really care
I didn't start this
I don't blame anyone
I don't feel nervous
I don't feel tired
I don't feel unsafe
I don't honestly know
I don't like anybody
I don't like trains
I don't make excuses
I don't regret this
I don't trust them
I get self-conscious
Does Tom have a bicycle?
Show me what's in your pockets
Tom isn't wearing a shirt
Why didn't you just kiss Tom?
Parking isn't allowed here
How did Tom get in here?
And what do you know!
What do bees eat?
The idea isn't new
You mustn't enter here
It's very wet
You'll be able to notice
I've won three times
I've only lost twice
I've noticed that
I've never stolen anything
I've never been back to Boston
I've made mistakes
I've made an appointment
I've got long hair
I've been so busy
I'm very, very lucky

I'm glad it happened
I'm feeling guilty
I'm absolutely fine
I'm a sports fanatic
I'm a single parent
I'm a problem solver
I'm a private person
I'm a little upset
I'm a business man
I'll never go there
I'll never do that
I'll most likely win
I'll miss everybody
I'll keep doing it
I'll eat the oranges
I'd tried everything
I'd never done this before
I'd never been there
I'd like to live in Australia
I'd like a coffee
I'd do this every day
I wasn't too nervous
I wasn't good enough
I think you're drunk
I think they're ready
I think they're lying
I think it's terrible
I think it's nonsense
I think it's natural
I think it's hogwash
I think it's awesome
I think it's amazing
I think everybody's tired
I think everybody's hungry
I think everybody's happy
I really didn't care
I hope you're well
I hope you'll agree
I haven't done that
Let's be honest
That's such a wonderful movie
Tom doesn't have a shirt on
It's time we do something
Please don't try this at home
I'm really enjoying the corn
I've eaten
He isn't a child
Please, hurry up
She's getting married soon
He's getting married soon
I didn't forget you
I'd like to be young again
When is his birthday?
When is her birthday?
You scared the hell out of me!
Don't make me come in there!
Grow up and act your age!
Excuse me, I'm Mr. Yamada
I've heard that story before
May I use the computer?
After ten days I'll go to Rome
I wish you'd make your mind up
I wish we didn't have to wait
I wish you weren't so lonely
I wish I'd looked at the map
I wish I'd brought more food
I wish I could've helped Tom
I wish I could've been there
I wish I'd done that sooner
I wish I'd bought more food
I wish I hadn't bought this
I wish I'd brought my skis
I wish my name wasn't Tom
I wish I didn't have kids
I wish I'd never sold it
I wish I hadn't cried
I'm on the way home
I wish I'd bought that bicycle
I wish you'd stop complaining
I wish it was Valentine's Day
I wish I hadn't lied to Tom
I wish Tom could've come
You don't really need it
He's swimming
Are you going to sleep?
Let the game begin!
I'm waiting for you in my room
I'm not prepared to compromise
I'm trying to translate
He's serious
How dare you laugh at me?
Do you meet her often?
Stop the nonsense!
My father didn't say anything
This house was built in 1870
I'm going to live forever
Thank you!" - "You're welcome.
Yes!
It feels so good!
You're right!
I'd never thought of it
Where can I buy a map?
Want a beer?
Beer?
We'll miss you terribly
You're so nosy
That boy's a big bully
I've got a terrible toothache
Are you filming?
Tom, are you filming?
I'm not in denial
Please don't ask again
I won't tell you
I'm not having them drink
What would I not do for him?
I'm not dusting anything
She's there then!
You'll need it
I wish you weren't so far away
I wish they hadn't done it
I'm a lot younger than Tom
Did Mary sign?
I can't meet you now
I'm much younger than Tom
Are you Tafsut or Tifyur?
I'm Tifyur
I'm not Tafsut
I'm Masensen
I'm not Mohand
Are you Masensen or Mohand ?
I've thought about it
I've really messed up
I've never done drugs
I've never bought jewelry
I've had some chances
I've got the solution
I've got nothing left
I've already retired
I'm tired of swimming
I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of all these lies
I'm sure of my rights
I'm still very active
I'm still on vacation
I'm sick of all this fuss
I'm pretty sure that's it
I'm pretty bummed out
I'm only thirty years old
I'm not satisfied yet

I'm kind of surprised
I'm happy, very happy
I'm glad you survived
I'm getting depressed
I'm getting a divorce
I'm feeling very good

I'm extremely excited
I'm ecstatic about it
I'm convinced of that
I'm confident in that
I'm committed to this
I'm coming back again
I'm an optimistic guy
I'm almost speechless
I'm a very lucky guy
I'm a competitive guy
I'm not satisfied either
I'd like a chamomile
I'd trust him with my life
I'd trust her with my life
She's such a perfectionist
Relatively often, they argue
I'm not Tom
I'm John
You're learning English
Mom, Tom keeps pushing me
When will it stop raining?
She's a marvelous girl
Open this door now!
Please open the door.
Just a minute.
Open this door right now!
Open this door right now.
Go away!
You can't just barge in here!
Eat a lot!
Look!
A flying cockroach!
Of course, the answer is yes.
He knows neither me, nor you
Come as you wish!
You'll be welcome anytime
Come whenever you want!
which singer do you like?
You're beautiful, you know?
You're a brat
You don't look happy
Why are you so angry today?
What shampoo do you use?
What on earth have you done?
We hope it doesn't rain
We didn't have to wait
Tom isn't at all upset
This isn't news
This isn't my job
This book isn't too bad
You're going crazy
Congratulations to you!
Yes it's mine
I hope you'll change your mind
I'd really rather not do that
I don't want to deal with it
I'll never forget your face
I don't want to upset Tom
I don't want to stay home
I love Tom's personality
I'll be at home tonight
I won't leave you alone
I wasn't expecting this
I wasn't able to fix it
I knew Tom didn't do it
I know you're in pain
I hope it doesn't rain
I didn't understand it
I didn't punch anybody
I didn't ask questions
I can't get used to it
I'll see what happens
I hadn't even noticed
I wouldn't trust you
I love that T-Shirt
I don't read
I don't cook
Is Mr. Roberto at home?
Where on earth did he go?
What will become of him?
It's not a cat
It's a dog
Did you eventually respond?
Who dares?
Come here, you two
I just can't forget it
I'm writing to the guy
I'm not speaking to you
He'll be a good doctor
Are you Masensen or Mohand?
I'll give it a try
It's dinnertime
I won't fly in a plane
I'm not going if Tom goes
Here's my address
Why do you do it, Tom?
It's nearly midnight
I'm ready for bed
They don't make beds
Let us know what's going on
Let us know where you'll be
Let's go there
Let's stand up
Let's all do it
Let's begin now
Let's leave now
Let's try these
Let's go surfing
Let's take turns
Let's wait a bit
Let's be tolerant
Let's change that
Let's change this
Let's forget that
Let's get with it
Let's go together
Let's remain calm
Let's attack again
Let's discuss this
Let's find out why
Let's keep talking
Let's look outside
Let's not complain
Let's all calm down
Let's be aggressive

That's not all we wanted
That's not my only worry
That's what makes me mad
Wi-Fi is available
In-flight Wi-Fi is available
Is there Wi-Fi on your campus?
This app doesn't require Wi-Fi
That's what makes me sad
The letter wasn't signed
Things couldn't be worse
We're on a treasure hunt
Why don't we ask someone?
Do you have any bug spray?
I didn't see anyone there
We don't know who the lady is
Are you unwell?
I'm unwell
I guess we're out of luck
I know that it's my fault
You'd better not tell her
She's very mad at you
You say you want to visit him?
You can't count on her help
He likes it, too
Where was he working then?
When did he leave here?
What's he so unhappy about?
What's she doing now?
I swear I'll wait for you
It's always been an issue
It's been a long struggle
It's more common nowadays
It's very, very expensive
That isn't what I believe
We don't have a television
That's all that I can see
That's not on my schedule
That's why I love it here
There isn't any time
We'll need some more time
What is it you have to do?
Why don't we ask somebody?
We don't have a TV
Don't hold hands in public
Tom wasn't married at the time
How are you children doing?
I didn't see anybody there
Tom and Mary don't want help
I wish that I'd known that
Is it really OK to do this?
It hasn't been decided yet
It's about time to do that
It's been great being here
Tom didn't give Mary flowers
It's beginning to get dark
Just don't do that anymore
Tom doesn't know Mary's kids
That's not all I had to do
That's what makes me angry
I see it's OK now
I haven't yet paid for that
Tom didn't know Mary was dead
It's not really that simple
The doctor didn't speak Berber
Do you have an Algerian phone?
Maybe I'll do that tomorrow
What did he do in Algeria?
That's been happening a lot
That's not all I have to do
That's not all we had to do
That's not confusing at all
The job is already 99% done
I would rather Tom didn't come
The meeting won't last long
Things aren't going so well
Are you having a good summer?
Do you have a daily schedule?
Which is more correct?
Do you remember who did that?
Which one is more correct?
Doing this isn't fun anymore
I didn't think I could do it
Mary's watch was stolen
I hope that I don't get hurt
I can't swim.
Neither can I.
I'm sorry that we're so late
It's been a pretty busy week
Tom doesn't know Mary is crazy
Many people wouldn't do that
Maybe you'll have to do that
Tom hasn't yet met Mary's kids
It's going to go well
That's always been a problem
That's going on my wish list
That's not all we have to do
The danger hasn't passed yet
There isn't anyone else here
They didn't give us anything
We don't need to hire anyone
What trends have you noticed?
How much will you have to pay?
I didn't see anyone go inside
He's her brother

She's in her room by herself
He's just thinking of himself
She's just thinking of herself
He's very pleased with himself
It won't cost much to do that
It's an amazing place to live
It's been three years already
That isn't a hard thing to do
That's a hard pill to swallow
That's all I'm doing nowadays

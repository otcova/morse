Leon's truck was also missing
Do you want a coffee?
Good morning, Tom
How are you?
Who do you want to play with?
I'm feeling generous today
That's really generous of you
Why do you need so much stuff?
Don't overcook the pasta
Is this information credible?
Is this data credible?
Can I ask you one last thing?
Who would want to live there?
Who'd want to live there?
Who'd want to live here?
This is a man-made beach
I'm in the minority
Bills, bills, and more bills
That's very brave
That's very brave of you
Where are all your brothers?
Why not?
Have you got a good memory?
Will anyone understand me?
Will they understand me?
Will I be understood?
Will people understand me?
Give me one last chance!
Don't drink any more beer
Are you married?
Are you married?
Good morning, Mr Miller
Please, have a seat
Good morning, Mr Miller
Come, sit down
I haven't had one for so long
It's 3.30
It's half three
It's 9.15
We're not going on holiday
It's all so long ago
It's all such a long time ago
Could you go to the market?
Maybe.
I'd like to know where he was
What causes athlete's foot?
It's safe!" they said
Does the story end well?
Hands off!
How will we live?
Are you awake now?
What are your options?
What options have you got?
What options do you have?
What options have we got?
What options do we have?
Don't block the exit
Don't block the way out
When can I start?
When can I begin?
What are our other options?
Don't hide behind your desk
We'll frame this painting
Is it worth repairing?
Is it worth getting repaired?
Is it worth having repaired?
I can't stay at home today
We've got maths tomorrow
We won't do that any more
We're not doing that any more
Oh, no!
We're running out of petrol
Ta-ra!
That fountain is well ugly.
Oh, do you think so?
No, Mary
Why've you bought flowers?
Why do you ask?
Because I just wanted to.
It's working well so far
Good morning, everybody!
Who'll save Tom?
Tom's car broke down yesterday
Tom didn't let us go
Tom didn't allow us to leave
Beak this enigmatic silence!
He'd grown so fast
She's a really playful cat
He’s a very gentle horse
Can you lend me some money?
I'm stony broke
Yaas queen!
Tom's identity was revealed
I'll be at home by the evening
It's scientifically proven
You can't learn by osmosis
She's a poor cook
She's a bad cook
She's an appalling cook
She's clearly over forty
She's close to sixty
She's easily moved to tears
She's gotten fat
She's gained weight
She's habitually late
She's in a green dress
She's in a very good mood
She's not afraid to die
She's not as patient as you
She's poor, but happy
She's someone you can trust
Leon had Amelia's backpack
Leon was in Amelia's partment
Leon ignored Amelia's text
Who has Leon's phone?
We're here
Leon can't tell for sure
Leon's parents were both away
Leon didn't go down to check
Leon knew Amelia wasn't lying
Leon didn't lock the door
Leon's masterpiece is ready
This isn't Leon's actual voice
It's artificial intelligence
Leon asked for Amelia's name
What's your name?
Leon.
That's a great name!
Leon saw Amelia's Ford Focus
Leon's TV was big
Leon's two TV's were robbed
The police didn't have at all
Leon's home reeked
Leon wasn't followed anymore
Leon didn't leave the theater
You're angry again
Should we move?
Definitely not.
Did you open a window?
Leon's room was ground level
Leon's back door was unlocked
He found a well-paid job
I've always had your respect
Leon shouted: "Police!
Leon's blue van was gone
TV will hinder Leon's sleep
Leon got to Amelia's door
Leon's screen was black
Leon banged on Amelia's door
Leon's window was wide open
Leon's lights were off
Leon's pillow was on the floor
Ukraine can't retake Crimea
Could Ukraine retake Crimea?
Can Ukraine seize Crimea?

We'll be here a few more days
May I ask one more question?
We're much more optimistic now
She doesn't like reading
She doesn't enjoy reading
What's this folder for?
What is this folder for?
Please don't run in the room
I'm sure he wanted to come
Can it be left like that?
She's butt naked
Lukas didn't do a good job
Lukas didn't want to come back
Lukas's house has a big pool
Lukas didn't jump in the pool
Lukas didn't want to get wet
What if that was Lukas?
Lukas's guests were asleep
It's open
Lukas started to run, too
Lukas's breath was disgusting
Lukas's food was prepared
Lukas called out: "Hello!
Lukas isn't going in that room
Lukas isn't going in there
Lukas used to work at Domino's
Lukas didn't find anything
Lukas couldn't drive too fast
Lukas's breath was awful
Lukas just kept saying: "Help!
Lukas was near Amelia's house
Lukas's tent was zipped up
Why isn't Lukas alone?
Lukas's food was in the tent
Pepper or salt?
Where is his part?
Now, what can we write?
Have you ever seen a muriqui?
Where's the border?
I can't see it

Lukas didn’t state his purpose
Lukas can’t talk about it
Lukas ignored Rima’s plea

Lukas vanished in Rima’s arms
Lukas can’t open the door
Paul wasn’t feeling well
Paul can’t go inside
Mummy, Tom keeps hitting me!
Tell him to stop!
What book is she reading?
Where are we going now?
Home?
Let's make camp here
It's naptime
We've got a week left
It's decided: I'm going there
Mr. Su is not at home
Six kilos?
Lame.
Fuck off, douche!
What did you call me?!
Six kilos?
Don't care what you think
He's a rich businessman
It's not time yet
She doesn't care about me
Am I next?
You weren't hungry
You're afraid of dogs
Or with a safe.
Do you really think so?
Where is the mountain?
Tom is Mary's child
He got older!
I'm more than willing to help
Have you found any more gold?
Where's the restroom?
Are there any other comments?
Tom's comments were racist
Tom's comments were offensive
Tom's comments were insulting
Why did apes lose our tails?
After all, we're similar
Paul went to sleep, too
Paul doesn't like that book
Paul's eyes were getting dry
Paul's apartment smelt awful
Why is there slavery?
Paul's basement had a bathroom
Paul's basement is sealed off
Paul's hands were dirty
Paul wasn't there anymore
What is modern slavery?
Paul lost power, too
What is slavery?
The basement door won't budge
Paul works in the summer, too
Even Paul's kids had Snapchat
Paul's window was wide open
What if this was Paul?
Paul came to Amelia's mansion
Paul ignored Amelia's messages
Where are you?
Home.
Where is home?
What do you mean?
Give me your address?
Who are you?
Paul doesn't have social media
Why did you remove me?
It's just a rumour
Paul approached Amelia's seat
Paul's warning was true
Paul ran to Amelia's room
Who likes spiders?
It´s raining hard
It's far from good
She's far from me
Breakfast, lunch, or dinner?
I couldn't look him in the eye
His eyes couldn't lie
Is Tom on the spectrum?
Is Tom a zombie?
His son's in prison
The future doesn't scare me
He fell down, he never got up
A LIDAR scanner isn't cheap
I'm gaining a lot of weight
I'm going to take a walk
I went into a children's shop
What if Tom doesn't do it?
Where's the toilet?
On the left.
For some, this is not enough
Enjoy your walk!
Will I hear from you soon?
Are they French?
No, Belgian.
What's up?
Someone's coming!
Who could that be?
I've got a headache again
I've got another headache
Who's the woman in pink?
That's Rosa, my wife.
Good morning, Mary!
You have 169 unread messages.
From how many senders?
One.
Tom.
Good morning, Mary!
No – I want coffee.
Coffee – coming right up!
It's brass monkeys in here!
Put a jacket on!
Is this person related to you?
No one is self-made
Don't be so nasty
I'd better go to bed
Paul didn't have much going on
What's Paul doing tonight?
Paul wasn't using the app
Paul's parents are home
Was it you at the window?
That didn't happen last night
Who had the idea?
Fight for your dreams!
Paul didn't have an iPhone
Paul didn't respond after that
Paul didn't leave a voice mail
Paul's voice sounded weird
Amelia wasn't a she at all
Paul used Amelia's bathroom
Paul dialled 911 on his phone
Paul's entire car was messy
Paul's house was so archaic
Paul used to have an iPhone 7
Paul lost his iPhone 7
Paul's flashlight sucked
Paul's smile disappeared
Paul's heart was still racing
Is that a cloud?
Guess again.
Paul heard the noise, too
Paul's teeth were small
Everyone screamed: "Surprise!
Is that made of gold?
It's a tough decision to make
He's in the shower, I'm afraid
That's the aim of the game
What time is it on the Moon?
You're going easy on me
You're letting me win
Don't go easy on me
Don't let me win
Those ones aren't for sale
Do you speak Croatian?
Do you speak Bosnian?
Do you speak Belarusian?
Do you speak Montenegrin?
Paul saw Rima’s confusion
Paul’s car was parked outside
Paul doesn’t have a ticket
Paul confiscated Rima’s phone
Paul looked away, disgusted
Paul won’t change
Paul couldn’t save Rima
Paul didn’t want to leave Rima
Paul wasn’t a zombie
I'm feeling a bit peckish
Paul doesn’t like Rima anymore
Paul’s body flew away
Stefan’s plan was successful
Were you rolling in the mud?
What if Tom didn't do it?
Is that a bull or an ox?
Why is he avoiding us?
Have you tried texting him?
Sorry, my pen doesn't work
May I borrow yours?
Did something fall?
Do you speak Vietnamese?
He hasn't read the message yet
You're a member of my team
Do you speak Khmer?
Do you speak Burmese?
Children, have a sit
Take a sit next to me, please
The man died the end of 50s
Akli was born in the early 20s
He is not afraid!
Can you get me a beer, please?
Who answered me?
Stefan couldn't follow Amelia
Stefan's legs couldn't move
Stefan won't wear any of these
Suddenly, the power went out
I wish I hadn't been so stupid
The noise wasn't constant
Someone yelled: "Housekeeping!
Stefan didn't say another word
Stefan left at 4:00 am
Stefan didn't stop to look
Stefan wasn't really tired
Stefan doesn't want to know
The car didn't move
It was Stefan's turn to enter
Stefan didn't want to call
Do you see the point?
A tablespoon or a teaspoon?
How could Stefan see Amelia?
Does it make sense?
Not really.
Stefan is Rima’s master
Stefan can’t see Rima again
Stefan said he wasn’t deaf
Stefan’s eyes were still red
Stefan cradled Rima’s head
Stefan’s eyes turned red
Stefan lost someone, too
Stefan noticed Rima’s necklace
Stefan didn’t reappear
I'm here to collect my pension
You can count on me for sure!
Do you owe me something?
One down, two to go
Where are the toilets?
On the left.
I don't agree with you on this
He's looking for an argument
It's easy to join the library
Am I all right in trainers?
That's terrifying
Who is this Tom anyway?
I've recovered from my illness
I've left the door open
I'll try to exercise every day
No, no, no, and again, no!
It wasn't easy for any of us
Why are you always alone?
Can you say that in German?
Let's devise a new strategy
Could i get uhhhhhh... burger?
Um, whats this?
Its a bird?
Oh.
Um, what?
He's in between life and death
This is an emergency alert!
Lockdown!
Lockdown!
This is an emergency alert!
There's someone in the toilet
You're welcome, it was nothing
Open up!
I gave it everything I've got
Don't come anywhere near!
We're going into lockdown
You're all gonna burn!
Stefan found that off-putting
Stefan's truck was still there
Stefan didn't want trouble
Stefan wasn't there anymore
Stefan's hobby is camping
Stefan's tires were replaced
Stefan hasn't driven in a week
Stefan's truck ran out of gas
Stefan called 911 again
Stefan's apartment was modest
Stefan petted Isabella's knee
The pigs aren't in the pigsty
Strangely, that door was open
Stefan knew he wasn't alone
Come back to take this.
No thanks.
It wasn't a request.
Oh, don't leave!
Stefan couldn't feel his phone
Who took Stefan's phone?
Stefan didn't even check in
Stefan goes to a 24-hour gym
It wasn't cold in the gym
Stefan wasn't doing anything
Do you see this phone?
Tobias can't do this anymore
Tobias found Isabella's email
Tobias's reputation was over
Tobias flew to Isabella's town
Do you speak Tibetan?
He's wearing a brown beret
Wait, I want to try something
I couldn't locate him
Cannibal!
Do you speak Uighur?
Do you speak Uyghur?
Catch them!
Catch her!
Long live Viviane!
The bitch!
She's such a bitch!
Let's finish them off!
You're looking for Tom
Don't overstep the mark!
What are you asking for it?
I'm learning Uighur
It's over
He's found his better half
Is he the man of your dreams?
Sugar is sweet, butter is fat
He's not here, is he?
He doesn't want a career wife
I'm the perfect woman for him
Don't take it away from Tom
You haven't visited Uganda
What do you want for it?
Don't eat my potato chips
Does the hen eat eggs?
He didn't have an easy life
What do you expect?
It's a Christmas classic.
How are things progressing?
What does Tom dream of?
Did someone hit you?
I hope you'll both be safe
You don't know German, do you?
You needn't have taken a taxi
You're always criticizing me!
We've got to hurry
Let's straighten up the desk
Whose book is on the desk?
Shall I call the doctor?
You can do it!
Do you have a student fare?
It's a shortcut to the school
When does school break up?
I'd like a corner room
Let's drive as far as the sea
The meeting lasted until 5
I'm allergic to pollen
Can't we use a simile here?
The thermometer stands at 70

I will help you, of course
Love to party!
Have you ever heard of Nessie?
Above all, children need love
Whose go is it?
Does that include breakfast?
It's the best score up to now
You needn't answer the letter
Air those shoes!
Single, please
I'll take a glass of champagne
Is this the train for London?
By whom was this poem written?
Whose is this textbook?
Is this jacket right for me?
This bag cost me 6 pounds

When did you get to Kyoto?
Hurry up!
You've got the wrong station
That can't be Mary
She's in hospital now
You needn't have come
Have you lost your reason?
Whose side are you?
Yari?
You are busy now, aren't you?
How often did you visit Kyoto?
You needn't stand up
Is it open round the clock?
Fire!", he cried
You are not coming, are you?
What's the time?
I've had it for today
I'm too tired
We needn't attend the meeting
As for me, I am satisfied
My robot's name is Multi
Write to him for me, Jan
My birthday is on March 22
I was born in Osaka in 1977
Am I included in the team?
I'd like to go to London

My sister hit the jackpot!
Clearly, the rumor is not true
You mustn't sit up late
I don't like both of them
Hello, what's that?
No, no
So today it's just me and you
Do you fancy me?
Could this work?
Today is April 1st!
Let's play some pranks!
Aren't they Englishmen?
Blow me down!
We don't have a tumble dryer
She's lost the plot
Don't be a douchebag!
I don't believe the rumours
Do you believe them?
No, don't worry about it
Which film did you see?
To succeed, you must believe
What bad news!
I've got a provisional licence
Can you do me a solid?
He's got a broad Scouse accent
I'd like some pop
Is that an illegal taxi?
Give up!
Amsterdam is amazing!
I'm sorry!
It's OK
Don't worry.
My vagina is beautiful!
I'll explain later
I'm cured, anesthetized
I've already forgotten you
I'm at peace
It's like bedlam in here
Are you in Paris?
You must be mad!
You girls look amazing!
He's paralytic
You're not the only one!
I've burnt myself
I don't like these sweets
Which album could it be?
I believe she's 40 years old
Tom's unscrupulous
I want blue eyes!
He's as dumb as a rock
It's pouring
Bush is not al-Qaeda's friend
It's far to go on foot!
Let's take the car
Does Tom have a ponytail?
I see," said the blind man
Do you have any friends?
She's got terrible handwriting
Don't poke the bear
Don't bother
There's no hope for you
I'm playing in the garden
I need help!
Have you become insane?
Do you?
It's my secret garden
I'll be back in three weeks
She's a student
There's no rush
You're reading
What?
It's already 11?
Well, sort of
Now, 'intruder detected'!
That means I have to kill you.
You're gonna be famous one day
What is his job?
I'm Spanish
You're thirsty
I'm fed up of it!
Tell them about your holidays!
My father?
He's very active
Let's drink this beer
Are you not a teacher?
You shouldn't have kissed her
I'm butthurt
We like it very much!
You're playing in the garden
My dog doesn't have a nose.
How does he smell?
Terrible.
I like green!
What else can I lose?
You should've seen me
It could've been me
Great!
I'll grab my stuff!
There is no stuff.
There is no sword.
Huh?
Oh, right
There is no Book.
How— I— But— Ganon?
There is no Ganon.
There is no Koridai.
Zelda, are you hearing this?
There is no Zelda.
King?
There is no King.
No...
There is no Link.
Oh da—

Up to 15 minutes
Tom won't be able to defeat me
Someone, get me a tissue
She's on holiday with a friend
Child can't talk bad word
Should I tell?
What day was yesterday?
Do you study?
Do you know my age?
I don't wanna know this
I don't want to know this
What do you fancy for dinner?
Why don't we flip a coin?
Let's give it a try!
Let's try and see!
Let's help each other!
Who wrote this?
It's totally illegible.
Tom, definitely.
You have the eye of an expert!
Should we order a takeaway?
Don't you want a unicorn, Tom?
Oh, go on then, I'll take one.
I will activate my robot!
a⨯b is abbreviated as ab
Do you possess all these?
He's the same as he was
What are you doing bro?
Have you been here before?
He's from a small town
They were close-knit friends
Is she there?
It's been raining for two days
Your attention, please!
It's just there on the sofa
Sami played Layla's ass
You don't know shit about me
Tom's car is needed
Even I don't know what to do
Quick, help me!
It's stuck in your mind again
When shall we go to London?
Tell me the matter, friend
I don't think I'll succeed
Hello, Little Red Riding Hood.
Stay away from me!
Feck!
They aren't married anymore
Let's not let the darkness win
Have no fear!
Do you use YouTube?
We shouldn't go there today
The doubt!
He's cool in his own way
I didn't say I was going to
It's not a bank
Has he been learning English?
Do you like learning English?
His day will come!
That isn't incredible
I'm envious of Tom's success
Has it stopped raining yet?
I wish he understood me!
Tom isn't great
He's just OK
What is an abacus?
Make sure you don't drop any!
I've always wondered why
Follow me and keep quiet!
Me?
Perhaps I should!
Tonight, we feast!
We could hardly wait!
Eight brothers and no sisters?
No wonder she's a tomboy
Nine planets, isn't it?
I never liked him, anyway
I never liked him, anyways
Then Mary started singing, too
You said you couldn't hear her
Suppose we didn't
Mary smiles when she's nervous
Have you finished that one?
We can read it when he's done
Is he finished?
Is he done?
I can't think of any right now
Is it really worth the price?
Did FC Groningen win or lose?
Find yourself another stooge!
What is this doohickey?
Don't ask me for help, ask Tom
He swore to avenge Tom's death
Do you have lager?
Kudos!
Yanni's hair is gray
Hello?
Is this Yanni?
Yes, Skura, it's me.
Yanni..
I didn't teach you that
It's not correct
It's on your left
It's nearby
Where is a good hotel?
It's unsuitable for children
“I will follow my path
Don't even doubt it
Where were you?
I was outside.
Where have you been?
I was outside.
Come here immediately!
Why did you do that?
Because I felt like it.
Is something wrong?
Wow!
Did he touch your butt?
Can you fill up this bag?
He's around my age
It's so damn warm
Wow!
He's that scary
Why should I obey you?
How do you like being single?
She can't orgasm
It's a provocative dance
Find a part-time job
He's like a Greek god
I'm not queer
Do I turn you on?
You're it.
Aha, gotcha!
Ahh!
Don't eat me, I'm too skinny!
Mary tastes better!
Tom, you traitor!
You're sweating
It's a hot summer's day
I'm a bit nervous
It's so huge
She's the wildest girl I know
Do you like my ass?
What would you advise them?
You make me so fucking horny!
Don't repress your emotions
Clench your butt-cheeks
She's farting all the time
I'm having my period
She's an easy girl
I'm sure he's angry with me
What's yours?
Tom's friend's name is Pierre
I'm addicted to cocks
It didn't even hurt that much
There's never a spot open
I'm a dominant top
He's gay, but closeted
Love isn't a feeling
It's a commitment
I'm feeling really blue
He's responsible for my pain
Someone, turn it off
Nobody knows I'm gay
He's a real pistol
I'm going where the sun shines
Did you masturbate?
He couldn't care less
I'll have my hair cut today
Butt out!
What makes you feel alive?
How did you get ahead of me?
I'm not afraid of dogs at all
Both of you, stay behind me
We're packing
Maybe you're working too hard
There's a picture on the wall
It'll be cooler tomorrow
Stay safe, alright?
I'm not afraid of Tom at all
I've prepared your bath
I'm getting a cold
I think I've caught a cold
This one's better
Tom's parents aren't living
Tom said he didn't care
That's my position
Jim won't come today
Tom isn't quite up to it
It's good that you've come
It's good that you came
What desk can you see?
Don't worry
I won't forget
Is it raining in Boston now?
Is it snowing in Boston now?
That's not a toy
That isn't a toy
I can't see anything
I'd forgotten how tall Tom was
What you're doing won't help
I hope that you'll come again
Could you come early?
I don't want to fall asleep
My in-laws are Canadians
Help me up, please
Tom's dogs barked at me
We're skeptics
We're picky eaters
Well, how are you?
We're pilots
Hi, I'm here
Tom isn't my nephew
He's my son
We haven't been here recently
Tom is my great-nephew
Who'll order what?
Who did this for me?
Tom didn't finish his sentence
Were the elections rigged?
Tom said he wasn't crazy

What is Tom complaining about?

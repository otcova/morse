The danger's gone
Ask an expert first!
Think first, then talk
This isn't a secret
How far away is Tom's house?
How far away is Boston?
How far away is Japan?
How far away is the moon?
How far away is the sun?
How far are we from the sun?
How far away is this star?
How far away is this galaxy?
It isn't genuine, Tom
At first, I didn't know why
Are you eating it?
They don't like Tom's dog
What'd you use?
What did you use?
You're very joyful
He doesn't listen to my advice
The plug won't come out
I don't want to watch ads
I'll read the newspaper
We don't have time to sleep
Tom is an all-around nice guy
I can't wait ten minutes
Case solved!
Is this the right road?
Today it's Wednesday
God fucking dammit!
I don't mind telling you
Tom died despite Mary's help
What's your mission in life?
Do you know?
Can you understand Tom?
What does he want to buy?
Tom guessed Mary's password
Could you spare a dollar?
I still don't have anything
I don't have anything yet
Don't use the black pen
I'm skimming Tom's report now
I'm sure I'll miss Tom a lot
I'm lucky to have good friends
I'm too drunk for this now
I'm going to leave early today
I'm sure Tom is guilty
I'm sure that Tom is guilty
I'm afraid we're out of stock
She's sleeping like a baby
It's beautiful out
We're studying music
Why do you put it here?
Which one is my left hand?
Please don't pop the blisters
We can't across the river
I can't find my charger
I'm not feeling well
Can I pay by check?
It's said that he's clever
It's said that she's clever
It's said that you're clever
Everyone's on the beach
Don't use the hammer
Don't use this hammer
Tom didn't offer to pay
Tom didn't offer to help
Tom didn't offer to help us
The picture's tilted

I don't know what to say.
Mom... please forgive me
Mom..
I'm Skura
Mom... please forgive me.
I forgive you, my son.
How can we prevent this?
When?
When I get old and sick?
This stupid car won't start
I'm unbelievably lucky
I'll sound our teacher out
Be outside in five minutes!
What do you expect me to say?
I'm not his girlfriend
I'm more interested in today
I know Tom wouldn't tell Mary
You speak Berber, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Are you sure it was Skura?
Sure I'm sure.
I'm in the middle of something
Can I call you back?
Boss, I can see you.
Ditto.
Does he like his children?
Who's that?
Listen to this.
Who's it?

Can I hold her hand?
Mom?
I don't think she hears you.
Can I kiss her, Doctor?
Mom?
I don't think she hears you.
Can I hold her hand, Doctor?
How's my mom, Doctor?
I'm sorry
She didn't make it.
Why are you crying?
Is everything OK?
It's my dad
He just passed away.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Do you still think about Dad?
Do you still dream about Dad?
When did Dad die?
When did Dad pass away?
Skura.
Yes?
Dad just passed away.
Skura.
Yes?
Dad has just died.
We couldn't have any kids
Why are you turning around?
I forgot my glasses.
You'll teach Berber.
Berber?
I'm really not made for that.
They went behind my back.
They made an error.
What did you father do to you?
11, 2001 terrorist attacks
“I feel optimistic.”
Tom doesn't have the virus
He was 88
What kind of risks did I take?
You wanted me, sir?
We're both toast!
We're both done for!
We will be so fucked!
You shouldn't do it like this.
Who's the doctor here?
All right.
He's drunk as a skunk
Some corn?
No, thanks.
Some peanuts?
No, thanks.
You can't fool a mother
You can't fool a wife
Come on, don't sulk
Please don't sulk.
I'm not sulking.
It's dead
Freeze!
I'm warning you!
He's married.
What does it matter.
Is this your new car?
Yes.
Congratulations!
Drive it in good health.
Is there a ghost in here?
He's loving
He's compassionate
He's a nothing, a nobody
What's this story he's typing?
Who are you calling a bimbo?
He can't read the menu
You're nothing but a liar
You're really beautiful.
Did you mean that?
Of course.
Run while it's still time
Do you still have that car?
Is that your truck?
Skura is in jail, Salas
Can she come, too?
She sure can.
How about some pizza?
Sure!
I could use a break.
I am not kidding about this.”
I'm not kidding about this
We can’t get more ventilators
When will the bad news end?
Don't wander too far
She'll call back
Couldn't it have waited?
I think he's serious
The barn's roof collapsed
Tom's wife left home for work
Tom's fear came true
Mary's fear came true
And me?
Why do people yawn?
Why do zombies love brains?
Tom's fears came true
Mary's fears came true
It's green, let's cross
Can I have one with chocolate?
I broke my hand!
You fatso!
Will it be of use for you?
No, I didn't blink at you
Can you get mono from a kiss?
Eat some!
Tell it to him!
Tell him it!
Is grumbling all you can do?
Away!
Let's keep the distance

It can't be shared?
One can't share it?
Who asked them?
Why are boys so cute?
Why are girls so attractive?
Why are guys so attractive?
No one should drink it?
Why is the sun so bright?
Why is water wet?
Tom doesn't have a penny
What is she going to do there?
What is he going to do there?
Let's sleep instead
Is the wine good?
What are we going to do there?
Why is this bread so tasty?
You don't think about anything
You did all this?
You already went to Athens?
Tom is not very touchy-feely
Mary is touchy-feely
He doesn't have good vision
I'm not a jealous person
Don't slurp when you eat soup
My fiancée is studying history
No, it's not possible
Could you lend me an umbrella?
Could you lend me a bicycle?
Where is your fiancée?
Let's warn our elderly
I don't have anyone in my life
Really, I'm fine like this
I'm wandering in the dark
It's not my place to say this
Don't worry, I got it
I'll help you out in a minute
What's Algeria's next step?
God bless you.
God bless you, too.
She'll be happy
How was your first day?
Don't ask.
He's a natural for that job
I admire you.
The feeling is mutual.

He said that he couldn't come
The building isn't safe
Don't be afraid of anything
Please leave me alone!
I really liked her accent!
I'm quite on edge today
I don't have a dark side
Everyone's got a secret
What is your secret?
I don't need experience
Have I seen you before?
I’m very calm about everything
I’m just taking it day by day
Her husband works there, too
“It’s overwhelming,” she says
I'm lucky to have some savings
“I'm worried
He'll soon come to
Look, nothing's wrong with her
She's not moving an inch
Look, she's fine
I'll kill you right here!
He can't breathe
Is he well, as of late?
He called them "imbeciles.
Don’t get the phone wet
I converted it to MP3
Do you eat well?

Is it something serious?
Yes, sort of...
Class is from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m
Call me at 9:00 tomorrow
She hasn't got glasses
He hasn't got glasses
He's never at a loss for words
He's got the gift of the gab
You can tell just by looking.

That's about 150 dollars
Have some fun!
Have fun?

The pile of shit hit again!
Just be quiet now!
Are you good in math?
Are you good at math?
Do you dare to ask him that?
Please don't waste water
Tom, you're blushing.
No, I'm not.
Everyone thinks I'm a mystery
Do you have sugar in your tea?
I'll just have straight tea.
Why do people feel afraid?
There's still a real lot to do
Let's get into it!
This piano has only 87 keys
I'll take you up on your offer
You couldn't pay me to do that

They're not prepared for this
I'm going to Boston next week
I don't know what I should do
You're really frightening me
You're imagining things, Tom
We'll have lunch early today
Tom wasn't prepared for this
Tom doesn't care about money
I think Tom's plan will work
Do you put sugar in your tea?
Will you have lunch with me?
We're quite certain of that
Tom's parents were murdered
Tom wasn't there last month
Tom waited, but nobody came
Tom didn't give me anything
Tom couldn't hide his anger
This smells very, very good
Did you suggest that to Tom?
Are you planning on staying?
You've helped quite enough
You're quite a philosopher
You'll have to practice it
Will you be riding with us?
We're prepared for a fight
Tom won't live much longer
Tom didn't wash the dishes
Tom didn't want get caught
Tom didn't even say thanks
Tom couldn't stop laughing

I don't blame Tom for that
You'll be quite safe here
Who did you get this from?
Tom wasn't happy about it
Tom knows what he's doing
Tom doesn't drink anymore
Tom couldn't stop smiling
There's still a lot to do

Do you have any plans yet?
You've had quite a shock
We're planning a robbery
We're nowhere near ready
Tom isn't very talkative
Tom doesn't wear glasses
Tom doesn't like it here
Tom can't have said that
Did you kiss Tom goodbye?
Are you planning to stay?
You're quite right, Tom
You hurt Tom's feelings
Where are you right now?
We'll manage without it
Tom wasn't ready for it
Tom wasn't quick enough
Tom wasn't feeling well
Tom wasn't disappointed
Tom must've told Mary
Tom has a full-time job
Someone stole Tom's car
I'll explain this later
Do you have lunch plans?
You're quite an artist
We're planning a party
Tom didn't see a thing
Tom can't come with us
I have a part-time job
I have a full-time job
Don't follow me around
Do you have a plan yet?
Are you jealous of Tom?
You're no fun anymore
You're hurting my arm
Tom wasn't even there
Tom didn't look happy
You're special to me
You're no fun at all
You'll be quite safe
Tom didn't eat lunch
Is that pencil yours?
You're quite a hero
I'm not married yet
What're they doing?
Tom can't be saved
Tom can't stop us
You hurt me, Tom
Tom's quite good
Tom can't sing
You didn't understand me
The first exam is done!

What was for lunch?
Mary's delicious pumpkin soup
My goodness, Mary!
You look completely tired out!
I didn't sleep a wink
What a great party!
He couldn't find any refuge
I'm a certified translator
It's always nice to hear you
I didn't do it deliberately
Has she got a dog?
Has he got a dog?
He didn't use to be like that
Today, I had a math test
Can I come with you?
Sure!
Who found the book I lost?
What!?
You ate my chocolate bear?
You can't deny him anything
Don't believe him
He lies left and right!
You can't deny her anything
Are you furious?
Be quiet," he whispered
When she saw me, she ran away
Yesterday, he wrote a letter
Can I use your dictionary?
Here you go.
It's very warm today
May I visit you tomorrow?
He's begun to look for a job
That's how it's always been
Make yourself cozy!
Would you lend me that book?
He's enjoying it
I can't open this bottle
Don't pull such a sour face!
Don't make such a sour face!
I've met him several times
I've met him many times
He's wearing sunglasses
I've decided to go
What's Grandma doing?
She's sleeping on the couch.
Yeah, no problem
Here you go.
Thank you!
He's called Jones
I'm sitting home alone
It's no walk in the park
You're upsetting me!
There's lighting right now
Well, I never!
Who cares about it but you?
I'm not your plaything
We were successful!
Halloween is over!
Live as if you'll die today
How do you synthesize aspirin?
What is your suggestion?
Who's going to be there?
I've done everything necessary
It was my pleasure!
I'm afraid we can't change it
And proudly, I'm one of them
The baby can't speak
Her baby can't speak
I can't speak another language
Don't blame yourself
Don't worry
He's not my boyfriend
He's just a friend
Don't rock the boat
I don't want to rock the boat
Who broke the coffee machine?
Who wrote this sentence?
You're out of here
I don't see the small car
Unbelievable!

I love carrots!
Miss, do you miss his kiss?
Are you back in Taipei now?
Your mom is so cute!
No, I want to pay in cash
He's a bad ass
I agree.
Mum's just gone shopping
When can we move in?
When can I move in?
He didn't get the job
She didn't get the job
I think so too.
Dont' hit me, please!
I think you're hungry
So is it 19 or is it 20?
I'm even older
Maybe it's the same person
You can't rely on him
Is it an animal?
Is it a plant?
Is it a mineral?
Is it a thing?
Is it something immaterial?
Who's doing the dishes?
What colour is orange?
Do you drink iced water?
Don't smoke so much!
I'm happy when you do that
What a failure!
I'm singing

I've lost my sense of smell
He'd just turned 59 years old
How did you sleep, dear?
Today, we're going dancing
We're going dancing today
Under what name?
I'd like to call him
Do you have his phone number?
I said I would do that!
I'm not going skating today
Is there any proof?
These apples are so delicious!
Southern men, Northern women
He didn't get jealous
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!
I can't live this way anymore
Whatcha readin'?
It's curtains for us
What if I say no?
I did what she'd asked me to
God, let the village be safe!
Drive carefully!
Don't go against nature

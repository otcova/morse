Is it because he's blond?
I'm an English teacher
My friend can't speak English
What use could this be to Tom?
That's not my objective
I'm sick of it all
I'm fed up with it all
There's a cat on the chair
Who signed that?
Let's look for it on eBay
Can you give me a sheet?
It's healthy to play
They're training
They're in training
I won't dare talk to him
I won't ever talk with him
Do you want some dessert?
He's such a flirt
He's so flirty
And who else has he told?
And who else did he tell?
You're Swedish
You're bullheaded
You've got a big head
Can you fill this bag?
Can you fill out this bag?
You're perfect!
It's because I want to learn
I just want to learn,
Let's go to bed at nine today.
Alright.
Let's go sleep at nine today.
Sure.
I'm a bit restless
The man isn't writing a letter
Guess whose birthday is today!
I don't weigh more than you
I've looked out the window
I don't like making decisions
Who's she?
Your girlfriend?
Who is she?
Your girlfriend?
Who is she, your girlfriend?
You should believe in science!
It's easy to prepare this
It's easy to make this
I'm here for the money
I haven't arrived yet
Will you come eat tomorrow?
I wouldn't go in if I were you
It's easy to get infected
Back of the line, kid
I don't need to go to work
Is that one yours?
I kissed Tom's neck
It's an old book
What did you call me for?
I'm heading over there now
Do you go to the gym?
What's all the noise, Tom?
I didn't expect you today
I don't mean any harm
Will Tom be on time?
Why am I so unlucky?
You're big-headed
Where can we find Tom now?
I really want to, but I can't
It's my dad's birthday today
I haven't learned that yet
I haven't learned to drive yet
How much is it per month?
It's one thing to have passion
Where are the Alps?
I'd like to earn more
Let's visit Tom sometime
I can't stop staring at you
It's too bad that happened
Let's go swimming.
When will Tom do this?
Let's go swimming.
I'd like to, but I can't swim.
Are you Canadians?
Are you a weight lifter?
I've made great progress
Is Tom leaving soon?
Will this help?
I can't get that in my car
Tom didn't want any more
You're a strange individual
Seeing Tom, Mary smiled
We're restaurant managers
Tom read Mary's letter aloud
I hope Tom hasn't left yet
Don't you watch TV?
Please don't forget
I'm stuck in the car
Where's my coffee?
Do they sell rakes?
I'm an organist
We're failing
I'm not drunk yet
We're friends with Tom
Can you handle this?
Does Tom know that I'm here?
Well, that's fair
Aren't you bored?
Who wants to talk to Tom?
Shame you can't come
Can you row?
Tom's plan could fail
I won't wash your car for you
I won't wash your car for you
Did Tom see Mary do that?
The plan isn't ready yet
Let's go play football
Have you cleaned your room?
Dad's just got home
Dad's just arrived home
I'll carry your suitcase
Let's tell Tom the truth
You're taller than her
There's no third possibility
There's no third option
There's no third choice
He's got a weird name
Maybe you've just forgotten
How did the game turn out?
How did the game end?
That's actually very simple
I'll be right back
It's sad what happened to Tom
Tom's uncle owns a ranch
He didn't pass the exam
Tom's farm is next to mine
She's almost sixty
It's worth a go
They themselves didn't know it
Have you ever flown before?
Maybe we're crazy
It's time to rise up
How's my ad libbing?
Impressive, right?
Pretty cool, huh?
I see this as a win-win
Well, I'm off now
It's worked for me so far
I'm a stutterer
I was close, wasn't I?
That was close, wasn't it?
Is Toki Pona easy to learn?
We're cowboys
I'm babysitting them today
If he can do it, so can I
If Tom can do it, I can too
What can I do to please Tom?
This can't be fixed
Why does Tom need it?
Do you have plans?
We're Tom's mentors
Don't whine
I'm waiting to speak
How long has Tom been away?
What a smart boy!
Tom doesn't work anywhere
Why do some people hate me?
Who would even do that to Tom?
Does my smoking bother you?
Tom's bag is full
Is that Tom's handwriting?
Mom, Tom pinched me
Don't forget to thank Tom
Is France at war with Islam?
Is France Islamophobic?
What is radical Islam?
He's around my age
I know you're careful
The lake isn't far from here
When will Tom get there?
It's so damn warm
Who noticed that?
Who's investigating Tom?
Don't forget to call
Tom didn't really listen
I'm staying home this summer
We're out of rice
Don't, look there!
Don't look, there!
We won't come again
I'll play it for you now
Is Tom ever late?
The knife isn't sharpened
Of course, Tom is lying
Slow down, please
I'll drop by tomorrow
You'd better listen to Tom
In any case, we will come
We'll be living together
I'll call you Tom
Here, take a drink
I'm happy Tom did it
Will you come back?
I didn't utter a word
My hostage's name was Tom
I think this isn't mine
Who'll forbid Tom?
They're curious
I don't feel like running
Doing that won't help Tom
Tom doesn't want to help us
From May, we'll get more money
Do you have cheaper ones?
Do you plan to come?
Come, watch and laugh!
I'll call you Monday
Don't do everything at once
Did Tom ask for anything?
I'll call Monday
She's waiting at the bus stop
He couldn't play the guitar
Why did Tom come with us?
They're walking barefoot
Why's Tom smiling at us?
Where did you get married?
I'm sorry I couldn't come
Let's go help Tom
Do you like zombie movies?
Don't you talk like that?
Don't you talk that way?
I'm taking a test next period
Do you like mangoes?
Did you want to stop Tom?
Where is my folder?
Your mic's on
Your camera's off
Are you ready?
Nope.
Alright let's go.
Say again?
Say that again?
These pants don't fit
I don't want a pet anymore
Did Tom really do it?
What's with Tom today?
We're vegans
What can I give you?
I don't want soup
Tom, give Mary some tea
I've met Tom's friends
Wow!
Could we meet today?
Why would Tom need it?
How can I get what I want?
I baked you a pie.
Oh boy!
What flavor?
Did Tom notice it?
Can't it wait?
I'll be downstairs
Could you please speak faster?
Tom can't stand up yet
I don't know how to sing
Why did Tom do this to Mary?
The rifle wasn't loaded
She's an Esperantist
It's not that much
I'd prefer to leave it alone
I'm not stubborn
I'm not stubborn
I'm persistent
I'll eat when I want
Wake up, dear
I can't run as fast as you can
Who's Tom eating with?
Who's behind this?
Does Tom follow football?
Can you water ski?
We're party animals
I'll call on Monday
Where's my folder?
I've already had three beers
Did you see how Tom fell?
I'm not a cat lover
What's Tom interested in?
That's hot
It's very quick
You don't like beer?
Don't you like beer?
Did Tom give you a receipt?
I accepted Tom's invitation
Let's start today
They're tulips
Why would anyone kill Tom?
Don't be a sucker
What if they kill Tom?
Don't you talk like that!
Don't talk like that!
We're construction workers
I'll give you a large discount
I'll pray for you, Tom
This won't fit you
I'll be gone in a moment
Which book did you give Tom?
We're resting
Tom lived a long, happy life
Have you ever gone camping?
It wasn't plugged in right
Did you?
Tom isn't dead
He's alive and kicking
Can't you see?
The future is here!
I don't know, bro
I've never thought of that
I don't know, man
I've never thought about that
What's a guillotine?
My teacher didn't like me
I'll go get some food
When did Tom last see you?
Tom's hiding in an alleyway
Why is it illegal?
What happens if I do it?
Get your own.
Oh, grow up
What should we discuss?
What are my rights?
How can you get a warrant?
Who gave you that warrant?
We'd do that
I'm studying to be a cook
He stood up, smiling at her
Is Mr Smith at home now?
It's worth reading that book
It's worth reading this book
Why's this wrong?
He's got a shedload of books
He's got loads of books
He's got piles of books
He's got tons of books
When does the train leave?
When does the train go?
The door won't open
Should I tell Tom this?
I promise I'll stop now
Doorbell," said Alice
Mary, could you see who it is?
It's Tom!" she whispered
We'll pretend we're not here!
He knows we're in.
Call that a beer?
Keep your voice down!
That's how they serve it here
We're not in Bavaria now!
Oh, I completely forgot
The rain's coming in
Where were you this week?
She's not sure
He's not sure
She did the washing-up
She was doing the washing-up
That's where it all began
We're strangers
The museum's interesting
She's stopped working
You've done that well
She wasn't unfriendly
It was well-meant
It was well-intentioned
Look at that!
You're smiling again!
You're smiling again!
Fancy that!
See?
You're smiling again!
About once every two months.
Every four days, more or less.
About once every four days.
Do you know where it's got to?
Is the material breathable?
Luckily, it turned out well
In the right order?
Yeah, of course!
That's cold comfort
That's not much consolation
That's not very consoling
Wouldn't hurt.
I wouldn't say no.
It can't hurt
Are you coming?
Your food's getting cold!
You haven't tied your shoes
Look in the rear-view mirror
Don't push!
Have you lost weight recently?
Have you recently lost weight?
Are you cold?
Are you cold?
It's a gripping film
I really don't like this
Check to see if it's right
It's going straight in the bin
Mind the oncoming traffic!
Will Tom come today?
Do you need a lift somewhere?
What's that lying on the bed?
What've you been watching?
What have you been watching?
It's not much use
It's still being used
What was in the post today?
Nothing important.
Are they real?
Are they real?
In which district do you live?
Which district do you live in?
They've suffered a defeat
What about this shirt?
It's going in the wash.
It's not safe
It's not safe
You'll soon notice
You'll soon notice it
It's not safe enough
It's not safe enough
It just looks that way.
That's just how it looks.
It's probably normal
He says he won't be coming
He says he's not going to come
He says that he won't come
Have they told him?
Did they tell him?
Are you exhausted?
Are you whacked?
Are you whacked out?
Are you tired out?
Are you worn out?
Are you knackered?
Can you make some room?
Can you budge up a bit?
Do you need transport?
Do you need some transport?
That would be brilliant.
We're cancer patients
It's an open-air event
Oh, let's forget it
Oh, let's not talk about it
Oh, let's say no more about it
Can you explain why that is?
I wish that I'd studied more
Do you have the list?
But where is my tea?
How much does this cap cost?
I'm going to Tom's now
Don't be stubborn
Tom's expression changed
I won't stay here long
He's not a soldier
My God, what have I done!
I don't play these games
Why do I obey you?
Did Tom offend you?
Did you play tennis recently?
What is a life worth to you?
What shall we cook?
Tom's idea isn't a bad one
I'll take a few days off
Is there any phone nearby?
Very well, thank you
It's not Tom's style at all
What do you want to order?
I'll buy three bottles of wine
People are self-serving
We're voice actors
When will Tom give up?
We're on the air
Why's Tom panicking?
Why?
Don't be annoyed
Tom's idea wasn't a bad one
I'm better than Tom, aren't I?
Tom still can't do it
Are you happy with Tom?
Tom can't keep quiet
They're women
Tom, come out here
I'll be done in a moment
If you do that, Tom will, too
OK, I'll try
I didn't draw this
Why did Tom rip us off?
Don't close it
We're hypochondriacs
I'm still working with Tom
Why's Tom richer than me?
How do you like being single?
Should I wake Tom up now?
She can't orgasm
His pre-cum coated my tongue
This can't be washed
Why did Tom hang up on me?
It's a provocative dance
We're pacifists
Find a part-time job
I've been thinking about you
What did I get wrong?
I'm not allowed to do so
Has Tom graduated?
We'll cover all the costs
Did Tom actually do it?
Tom loves Mary's company
I can't accept this money
Tom said he'd do this
Is Tom also from Australia?
Do you have a conscience?
Tom said that he didn't care
I can't help but feel sad
It's not worth it, Tom
After that, Tom was fired
We're TV addicts
Don't be silly, Tom
She didn't have any friends
Tom's shoelaces were untied
That's not why I like Tom
I promise that I'll stop now
This pear isn't ripe
We're very smart people
Were you tested for COVID-19?
Tom was tested for COVID-19
I'd like another cup of tea
Obviously, the bus is late
Aren't cigarettes bad for you?
It's a menace at my school
I've never smoked before
Tom's grades are really low
Now don't be upset
Tom goes by "he/him
I'll cry in my room
Maybe Tom won't go
What happens?
I think I’m gonna throw up
They’re countless
They’re too many to count
I’m aware of it
What time are we meeting up?
He won’t finish it today
Did you see Tom kissing Mary?
“Just a minute.”
“I’m coming.”
He's of Irish descent
There wasn't a single one left
I can’t guarantee you that
Can I make a call?
I’d like to sleep better
The fan won’t stop
I don’t like your attitude
You’re a show-off
You’re so arrogant
I don't have a decent suit
You’re so conceited
You’re so full of yourself
You can’t stop inside a tunnel
It’s a tricky road
She’s a very famous person
How do you deal with Tom?
She’s a very well-known person
She’s very famous
She’s very well-known
Have you stopped loving me?
Which seats do you prefer?
Surely it’s closed by now
We won’t wait a minute longer
I’m deaf and I can’t hear you
Don’t raise your voice
I wouldn't hurt a fly
“How much did you buy it for?”
“About 20 euros.”
“That cheap?
Really?”
Did you go to talk to Tom?
What's the charge?
They’ve had a nightmare
I’ve told you no already
Cicero’s glory began to grow
“What does this look like?
“A sad man.”
OK, I'll help
Did you buy milk?
I don't drink this stuff
Doesn't Tom trust us?
It's been a year
I didn't come here to talk
Everyone's tired of Tom
We can't do better
I'm getting sleepy
How about you?
I didn't say I was leaving
Why did you get Tom drunk?
Do ducks eat fish?
I'm going to do the best I can
It's not that small
Someone’s still in the shower
Who's Tom flirting with?
How old you are doesn't matter
I've already told you no
I can't wait here much longer
Did anyone escape?
How did we end up here?
Tom doesn't have enough food
Don't bother to wait for me
I'm going to stay and fight
I soon fell asleep, too
Did Tom agree to do it?
What made Tom do this?
I haven't broken anything
We're French teachers
Tom didn't come in
I don't like vulgar jokes
We'll be open tomorrow
I could do it, but I won't
Will Tom do it or not?
We're millionaires
What did Tom call you?
Tom noticed Mary's excitement
See who's at the door
Go see who's at the door
Did you give Tom anything?
Can I have a beer?
I've corrected it
Tom couldn't do this
Are you and Tom still dating?
You'll say yes, won't you?
Where are my notes?
I certainly won't go there
When did you stop loving me?
What if Tom was kidnapped?
The weather's fine
Did you miss my kisses?
I probably won't succeed
Does Tom do it often?
Who's your favorite superhero?
It's hard to impress her
What do you need braces for?
I just can't stand some people
I must've gotten carried away
Tom could've done it himself
Today's been unproductive
It's been an unproductive day
Why do you keep teasing me?
We're paramedics
Tom doesn't know too much
They already arrived?
At what time?
They got there already?
When?
They got here already?
When?
Did Tom tell you about it?
Thanks.
What for?
For everything.
Thanks.
For what?
For everything.
I didn't have that chance
Who lives below you?
What's the name of Tom's dog?
What will we do today?
We're pretty good students
Does Tom keep his promises?
Who lives underneath you?
Does he smoke?
Is he smoking?
I didn't understand at first
If you love Tom, tell him so
Skura.
Yes, Yanni.
We'll get in
Why are you bringing this up?
I'm going to get you some help
Where did Tom sit?
I don't dare do that again
There's room for one more
I don't like wearing vests
Why's Tom lying to me?
Nobody's coming
Can I just say, wow
It's 4:30 in the morning
We found Tom's suicide note
What do you mean?
That's my breakfast.
Tom should do it, too
Come here, gimme a hug
I'll call tomorrow
How can we get what we need?
Here’s the kitchen
Can you see the cat?
Where's my pullover?
Does your knee hurt?
Where’s my cap?
I’m going to wear jeans
Where is Jabu’s cap?
I'm not sorry I came
Where's the mosque?
It’s next to the shopping mall
Skura.
Yes, honey.
I told Mom about us.
Who'll row?
Don't mess up my lipstick
Don't mess up my lipstick.
Bless your soul, my son
That's going to be fun
We'll have to leave
Don’t drop those glasses
Prices are sky-high
I'm trying to gain weight
Who's Tom swimming with?
Have you seen mine?
Tell them I'll come
Where is your conscience?
I didn't listen to anyone
Didn't you call Tom?
Why did you hang up?
Tom, you should go
I'm also from Australia
It's gone
Wow, that's a lot of books!
I'll be gone in a minute
Who will Tom call?
He's like a Greek God
There's so much spunk over me
I'll be on vacation next week
I'm a little afraid of Tom
I'll be leaving next week
I don't even have a phone
Which one did Tom choose?
Why do you tolerate it?
My chest is about to burst!
Me too, my lungs are full...
Are the measures legitimate?
I'll see what's going on
Here's the key to my office
Are you taking the pill?
He'll play tennis tomorrow
I'll never take this ring off
We're grandfathers
OK, I'll talk to Tom
It's too late
We'll see each other at home
What will we do?
But it wasn't a problem at all
Too bad, so much for me!
Was that a dragon?
We're not likely to find Tom
We'd like to help, too
I'll upload it right away
Did Tom say where he went?
I'll stay at a friend's house
Which language is it?
I'm drinking beer now
I don't need all this
We're a bit tired
Do you mind if I wait here?
Don't you mind waiting here?
If you want to go, you can go
Is Tom younger than me?
I'll never go home again
I don't need details
I don't shave every day
Has anyone called Tom?
We'll get it back
I'm a collector
Why did Tom abstain?
Things won't stay this way
Well, we warned you
What do you do now?
I'm from a large family
Can I leave my suitcase here?
I suspect that's a lie
Why did Tom talk to Mary?
That's what I hope happens
We aren't bored
Tom went hang-gliding
I'll do whatever you say
I wish I'd married Tom
I think I'll have a drink, too
Did you defeat Tom?
Don't lock the door yet
I wasn't the one who drew this
Who's Tom singing with?
We're chauffeurs
I don't have any money either
Who's that singing with Tom?
Is Tom going to come today?
If you want to go, it's OK
Where can I hide this?
Do you know where to put that?
I don't like to plan ahead
That's Tom's ex-wife
Are you really alone?
I don't like swearing
I've done what you requested
Do you live with Tom?
Are we not welcome here?
Tom wasn't understood
What do you live on?
Why do we need Tom?
It's almost winter
It's going to rain all week
We didn't say that
I'll prove it to you now
Would you like to ask Tom?
We don't smoke
Who accompanied you?
I've finished all my homework
Will you help Tom?
Why did you fight?
Tom didn't call you, did he?
How does this help anyone?
What should we say to Tom?
Tom didn't understand at first
I'll never take off this ring
Tom's bag is on the table
I'll sell my car tomorrow
Ask Tom what he'll eat
Will you ever do that?
I'll call you myself
This rule doesn't apply to you
I didn't immediately agree
How far can you swim?
Do you have a ladder?
Is Tom related to you?
Just don't give Tom any money
We're Giants fans
How did he survive that?
Yanni.
Yes, Skura.
Dad died this morning.
If I don't help you, who will?
Yanni's grandad died in 2004
Oh, you're dressed up!
A special occasion?
Let's support Tom
I'm not queer
Let's go right now
I can't find my portfolio
Where did you pick Tom up?
We're having a sale today
I'm sorry that I couldn't come
Do I turn you on?
Are they feminists?
I'll try to help
You can't only eat meat
Why did Tom do this to me?
Who found my son?
Have a nice day, my dear
It's up to Tom to decide
Do you know how to milk a cow?
Can you trust Tom at all?
It's clear that you lied
Should we go out?
What are you going to order?
I'm self-taught
I'm going to try to be there
Face the consequences!
I miss you so much, Tom
Who are you anyway?
She's with you
I'll tell them everything
It's clear that Tom did it
Who is Tom walking with?
With whom is Tom walking?
Are you newcomers?
We're fast drivers
We're bus drivers
I'm writing a term paper
Did you call Tom at work?
We're up here
Which one was right?
You can't change the world
Tom admires Mary's work
I can't leave with you
It was Tom's choice
It's all been taken care of
How is your little sister?
Of course, I forgive Tom
I'm not pressuring you
I bet it's Tom
I love you very much!
Who needs my help?
Woon jy aleen?
I'm not leaving for good
Don't do it on purpose
I couldn't find the toilet
Why?
You thought right!
Who's Tom dancing with?
What's a vampire?
I'm not saying it's easy
Why did Tom buy it?
I've solved the problem
English.
Mary isn't my daughter
I'll go put the kettle on
What's dermatology?
I know who's behind this
Now, where do we go?
Let's stay with Tom
Tom's attention turned to Mary
Where's the garden?
I know that you're very busy
May I take a look?
I'm sure I'll be on time
These are Tom's slippers
We're family men
Apparently, Tom trusts me
That's really sneaky
We aren't vegan
You're it.
Aha, gotcha!
Ahh!
Don't eat me, I'm too skinny!
Mary tastes better!
Tom, you traitor!
We didn't invite Tom
I wish I'd studied more
What could I do there?
Tom's clothes were wet
I just couldn't afford it
It's too smoky here
Maybe we won't invite Tom
The spear didn't hit Tom
What a crazy world!
A lot of people don't get cats
They didn't want Tom there
Tom didn't speak to us
Is Tom very worried?
Of course, I forgave Tom
Was it easy for you?
Do you feel nervous?
I wasn't safe there
Can you get out?
Has anybody called Tom?
I'll see what's happening
I'll fix everything
I'm from Australia, too
Tell them that I'll come
Who's that swimming with Tom?
Doing that's going to be fun
I'm sure Tom can help us
Tom won't wait any longer
I'd suggest getting a dog
You shouldn't ask Tom for help
Tom didn't speak to anyone
Tom hasn't spoken with anybody
Tom hasn't spoken with anyone
It's fun being a kid
What console do you play on?
What shirt size are you?
I'm a large.
Any idea where Tom is?
Tom cleaned Mary's car for her
Tom's father is Jewish
Tom, did you find your book?
How's this translation?
We're spoilt for choice
I think it's about to rain.
So do I.
I'd like a box of cookies
Mary – that's my name
How much have you got on you?
How much do you have on you?

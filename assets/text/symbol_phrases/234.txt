We're all tired of losing
We're all still confident
We're afraid of the water
We're a very poor country
We'll serve fried chicken
We'll probably never know
We'll never be complacent
We'll know in the morning
We'll know in a few hours
We'll add you to our list
We would've done anything
We won't ever abandon you
We won't be pushed around
Hats off to him!
Let's make another toast
I'd like to, but I can't
I'd love to, but I can't
He didn't seem bothered at all
I'm no longer attracted to you
We think that's realistic
We haven't yet hit bottom
We have a three-game lead
We feel we're good enough
Tom hasn't yet been charged
We don't want to harm you
Tom hasn't returned to work
We didn't play well today
Tom hasn't forgiven anybody
Tom hasn't been spotted yet
We can't take a night off
We can't let it get to us
Tom hasn't been charged yet
We can't just wait for it
We can't control all that
Tom hasn't been campaigning
We aren't grown up enough
Waiter, bring me a double
Three weeks and we're off
This isn't a fair boycott
This isn't a complex case
They're very much in love
They're pretty good at it
They're not going to quit
They're all back on track
They'll have to accept it
They don't need to change
They didn't catch the bus
There's so much diversity
There's no room for doubt
There's justifiable anger
There's a reason for this
There aren't enough of us
The question is, will you?
The question is, where to?
The process isn't perfect
Tom doesn't have a favorite
Tom doesn't cut any corners
Tom died from burns in 2013
Tom didn't worry about that
Tom didn't try to be a hero
Tom didn't return our calls
Tom didn't quite trust Mary
Tom didn't make it that far
Tom didn't know his parents
Tom didn't even last a year
Tom didn't even go upstairs
Tom didn't escape unscathed
Tom didn't commit the crime
That's when it gets tough
That's what this is about
That's what sets us apart
That's what it feels like
That's the real challenge
That's right on the money
That's our plan right now
That's not the main issue
That's no laughing matter
That's my life's ambition
That's how we were raised
That's how it all started
That's exactly what I got
That's certainly a factor
That's been my main focus
That's been known to work
Tom certainly isn't pleased
That's a lesson I learned
That'll give us more time
Tom can't treat me this way
Tom can't fix what's broken
I can't draw
Sure, we've made mistakes
So, am I back on the team?
Silence isn't always good
There's no arguing with Tom
The judge gave Tom 30 years
The gentleman's name is Tom
That's the problem with Tom
Thank God Tom wasn't killed
Thank God I didn't hurt Tom
Oh, it's right over there
Put yourself in Tom's shoes
Mary's husband is named Tom
No, but thanks for asking
It's a very bad day for Tom
Is Tom getting on all right?
I've seen Tom once or twice
I've got a history with Tom
I've defended Tom up to now
I've been told you knew Tom
I'm proud to say I know Tom
I'm not here to replace Tom
Money can help, of course
I'm not being unfair to Tom
Monday wasn't much better
I'm happy Tom survived that
I'm Tom calling from Boston
I'll vote for Tom next week
I'll get that back from Tom
Let's talk about the poor
Let's hope it stays there
I'll be doing that with Tom
Let's go up to your house
Let's give them their due
Let's end it here and now
Let's be clear about this
Let's be clear about that
I think I'll stick with Tom
I must be very careful, Tom
It's yet to be determined
It's what I always wanted
It's very tough right now
It's such a special place
It's something new for me
It's pretty much the same
It's pretty much over now
It's not the only example
It's not an exact science
It's not an easy solution
It's not always about you
It's much better this way
It's just a weird feeling
It's hardly been a secret
It's harder than it seems
I don't think Tom can dance
It's happening to me, too
It's going to snow Monday
I don't see Tom coming back
It's going to get tougher
It's going to be so great
I didn't get along with Tom
It's funny you should ask
It's easy to believe this
How are you making out, Tom?
It's definitely different
It's amazing how it works
How are you getting on, Tom?
It's always good to laugh
It's all about the timing
Did anyone think to ask Tom?
It's all about having fun
It's a whole new ballgame
Are you getting sick of Tom?
It's a never ending cycle
It'll take care of itself
Why won't Tom just shut up?
It'll probably be a while
It'll be a little cramped
Who lives next door to Tom?
It'll be a costly venture
It wasn't always that way
What's the latest with Tom?
What'll Tom's next move be?
What would Tom's motive be?
What did Tom know about it?
What cost Tom the election?
It was discovered in 2013
What can you say about Tom?
Were Tom and Mary together?
We're not giving up on Tom
We'll always love you, Tom
We'd love to have Tom back
Was Tom asking for a raise?
Tom's work is widely cited
Tom's wife has been killed
Tom's throat had been slit
Tom's story is even better
Tom's smile was contagious
Tom's real name is unknown
Tom's last name is unknown
Tom's injuries were severe
Tom's ideas were ridiculed
Tom's heart began pounding
Isn't this a serious flaw?
Isn't that the whole idea?
Tom's got a weight problem
Is this a common practice?
Is the staff professional?
Tom's death was mysterious
Is that what I was saying?
Is that really how I look?
Tom's death was a homicide
Is it football season yet?
Is it different this time?
Tom wouldn't discuss money
If it happens, it happens
I've given you everything
I've enjoyed it immensely
Tom won't last much longer
I've enjoyed every minute
I've done that every year
I've been waiting forever
I've been very privileged
I've been selling my hair
I've become more tolerant
I've always wondered that
I've always been a leader
I'm with a bunch of girls
I'm very much aware of it
I'm tired of hearing that
I'm the master of my fate
I'm sure this helped them
I'm sure that was helpful
I'm so glad we were there
I'm so glad I didn't know
I'm retired and have time
I'm really not a weak guy
I'm really hard on myself
I'm really happy for that
What is your personality type?
I'm ready to support this
I'm ready to start Monday
I'm quite humbled by that
I'm proud of this program
I'm proud of this country
I'm pretty hard on myself
I'm paying a lot of taxes
I'm not to be interrupted
I'm not real good at that
I'm not frustrated at all
I'm not even sure of that
I'm making no predictions
I'm looking to buy a home
I'm looking for the truth
I'm just letting you know
I'm just happy that I won
I'm in agreement with you
I'm here for the audition
Tom wasn't born a Canadian
I'm happy with everything
I'm happy that's resolved
Tom wasn't around for that
I'm going to kill someone
I'm going to have a child
Tom wasn't a bit impatient
I'm going to fall in love
I'm glad to get that over
I'm glad they took action
I'm glad I'm on your list
I'm entitled to an answer
I'm eager to come to work
I'm done being irrational
I'm ashamed to admit that
I'm an executive at heart
I'm always happy to do it
I'm addicted to lollipops
I'll take almost anything
I'll sleep better tonight
I'll buy a shirt tomorrow
I'll ask you one question
I'd love to have it today
I'd like to win on Monday
I wouldn't have risked it
I wonder what that's like
I won't watch CNN anymore
I wish we'd get some news
I wasn't effective enough
I think we're pretty good
I think the point's clear
I think it's coming along
I still can't really hear
I said it wasn't an error
I know it's a lot of time
I know I'm a good fighter
I heard jail isn't so bad
I have a check for $3,000
I feel like it's my place
I don't use crack cocaine
I don't have a family yet
I didn't want to camp out
I didn't choose this life
I didn't care what it was
I didn't call him by name
I didn't ask to be abused
I couldn't get through it
I couldn't call my family
I can't take it seriously
I can't put it into words
I can't do that every day
I can't believe I made it
Tom thinks it's hysterical
I'm not very confident at all
Why are we stopping here?
What about him?
That man is your father.
What?!
You can't be serious!
I'd rather not be a slave
I'd prefer not to be a slave
Do you speak Talysh?
Tom thinks it's all a joke
How were the teams chosen?
How valid are the results?
How much stock do you own?
How much are the payments?
How is that any different?
How happy is happy enough?
How do you not understand?
How do you define success?
How do people afford that?
How do I delete this file?
How did you get into this?
How can they condone this?
Here's what you should do
Here's how the game works
Here's another prediction
Have you experienced this?
Get out of here, you mutt
Everything's within reach
Everything's clear as day
Do we truly love Sabah?
It's a new year
Let's move forward
Aren't you working today?
I'm on leave
Why don't you stop?
Don't be too arrogant!
Don't let them bother you
Don't let down your guard
Don't be deceived by that
Don't be caught off guard
Does this surprise anyone?
Does that description fit?
Does it ultimately matter?
Do you accept the premise?
Do I look like a stripper?
Did you order the bombing?
Did you just look outside?
Tom said he's not doing it
Could you hold it, please?
Cost hasn't been an issue
Tom retired after 30 years
How do I get there?
Can you give us a preview?
Can you even speak French?
Can the country afford it?
Are you feeling the pinch?
Are you comfortable there?
Are we honestly surprised?
Are they not victims, too?
Are there dangerous areas?
Are all those people poor?
And then what will happen?
Your plans won't succeed
Tom made an illegal U-turn
You're really incredible
You're in charge of this
You know where I'm going
You don't have to settle
You don't have to choose
Will you please stop now?
Will there be resistance?
Will their marriage work?
Why would you call a cop?
Why wasn't I in the loop?
Why shouldn't I kill you?
Why not make it official?
Why is the train delayed?
Why haven't I been fired?
That's always broken
I've eaten my sandwich
You're too small
He's the father of the bride
Why did you stop writing?
Why did you kill my baby?
Tom laughed half-heartedly
Why are they worried now?
Why are there exemptions?
Who's going to beat them?
Who's buying these bonds?
Who wants money from you?
Who doesn't want to work?
Who cares about calories?
Who called me last night?
Who are we making fun of?
Where is your patriotism?
Where else could they be?
Where does this leave me?
Where are you off to now?
Where are our priorities?
Tom just couldn't go there
Where are my mom and dad?
When will you forgive me?
Tom isn't so understanding
Tom isn't so sure just yet
What would keep us apart?
What were the best parts?
Tom isn't off the hook yet
What was your first clue?
What should we call this?
Tom isn't innocent anymore
What makes you different?
What kind of cop are you?
Tom isn't even a contender
What haven't I asked you?
What happens if it rains?
Tom isn't about to give up
What good are you people?
What do you need from me?
Tom isn't a client anymore
What do you guys believe?
What do I need a job for?
What did your doctor say?
What did you slap me for?
Tom is unbelievably naïve
What did they talk about?
What damage did you find?
What chance do they have?
What brings you two here?
What are your principles?
What are your hours like?
What are you involved in?
What are we dealing with?
What are they wanted for?
What I don't know is why
Were there any customers?
Well, I guess we blew it
Tom is shy, but aggressive
Well, I guess this is it
Well, I don't see a ring
We've waited a long time
We've moved on from that
We've lost some momentum
We've got it all covered
We're terribly concerned
We're stronger than that
We're still deliberating
We're pretty scared here
We're pleased about that
We're officially engaged
We're not making this up
We're not going that far
We're not even that poor
We're managing just fine
We're looking for trends
Tom is married, Mary isn't
We're just average folks
We're complete opposites
We're changing the rules
We're all very outspoken
We're all still in shock
We'll take a quick break
We'll see what they want
We'll see how it unfolds
We'll continue to use it
We'll be looking for you
We think it's a big deal
We shouldn't forget that
Tom is a mild-mannered man
Tom hasn't had any regrets
Tom hasn't come of age yet
We haven't seen that yet
We don't need to splurge
We didn't play very well
We didn't have an answer
We can't beat the system
Tom has made an about-face
We weren't born yesterday
Was your office involved?
Today it's freezing cold
Those who can't do, teach
This wasn't an easy deal
This isn't on the agenda
This can't go on forever
They're to blame as well
They're the team to beat
They're still chasing me
They're running in place
They're on the same side
They're of no use to you
They're not made anymore
They're not hard to find
They're moving toward us
They're going to trap us
They're going to make it
They're going to love me
They're going to like me
They're going to kill us
They're going to hear us
They're going to find us
They're going to be here
They're fixing the latch
They're fighting over me
Tom figures he's not alone
They're eager to see you
They're coming to get us
They're coming right now
They're all pretty tired
They're all going to die
They'll be tough to beat
They didn't go back home
They didn't do their job
Tom didn't want to hear it
There's no middle ground
There's no life on Pluto
Tom didn't want to be rude
There's no cure in sight
There's always something
Tom didn't think so at all
There's a cop behind you
There's a bus stop there
Tom didn't see it that way
There won't be much more
Tom didn't see anyone else
Tom didn't put up his hand
Tom didn't make the top 20
Tom didn't like being poor
Tom didn't know who did it
Tom definitely didn't mind
The public didn't buy it
The party's winding down
Tom cut across Mary's yard
Tom couldn't talk about it
Tom couldn't open his hand
Tom could've used the help
The 1930s were different
That's your top priority
That's what my wife wore
That's not the way it is
That's not strictly true
That's not even an issue
That's not a real secret
That's my kind of action
Tom backed up Mary's story
That's missing the point
That's just what we want
That's just not the case
That's just not my thing
That's how I feel anyway
That's absolutely untrue
That's absolutely absurd
That's a very good story
That's a priority for us
That's a pretty big hole
That was nice, wasn't it
Tom admits he wasn't happy
Sometimes you can't tell
Some people don't get it
So what's your deal here?
So what's this all about?
So what were the results?
So what was the solution?
So what is your solution?
There's snow everywhere
Should you have a prenup?
This isn't about me or Tom
Should we be intimidated?
Shall we call the police?
Things didn't go Tom's way
Rub it in, why don't you?
That's not how Tom sees it
That was true for Tom, too
That can't be good for Tom
It's great to see Tom back
It wasn't that bad for Tom
Oh, you know what I mean
Now they've gone too far
Is Tom a hero or a traitor?
If Tom goes, I'll miss him
I've watched Tom carefully
I've got to hand it to Tom
I'm going with Tom tonight
I'll go with Tom this week
My mind's barely working
I read Tom's message first
Maybe we'll recognize it
Let's wrap this thing up
Let's tear down the jail
Let's take a deep breath
I don't think Tom meant it
Let's start with the why
Let's start from the top
I didn't want to shoot Tom
Let's not confuse things
Let's not be stupid here
Let's find common ground
How did Tom make his money?
Here's where Tom was wrong
Here's what Tom had to say
Do you like Tom for a name?
Be grateful Tom isn't in jail
Kids don't have a choice
Why can't Tom take a joke?
Why can't Tom do the same?
Just humor me, all right?
What if Tom was one of us?
It's what I always drink
It's time we fought back
What do you mean Tom quit?
It's time I acted my age
It's something like that
What did Tom just call me?
It's something different
It's really hard to stop
We've never talked to Tom
It's out of your control
It's of no value to them
We're paying Tom's salary
It's not my place to say
It's not easy but doable
It's not always possible
It's not always my fault
We can't let Tom down now
It's not a simple answer
It's never going to last
It's making me nostalgic
It's just what you think
It's happening to me now
It's going to get uglier
Tom, I'm with you on this
It's going to get better
It's going to be awesome
Tom's throat had been cut
It's difficult to sum up
It's been very rewarding
Tom's speed is incredible
It's been very difficult
It's been truly horrible
Tom's last day was Monday
It's been a tough winter
It's been a strange year
Tom's hair was disheveled
It's been a long process
It's been a long journey
Tom's got to take it easy
It's been a huge success
It's been a hard journey
It's been a great summer
It's all a great mystery
Tom's got school tomorrow
It's a strange situation
It's a relevant question
Tom's best friend is Mary
It's a little surprising
It wasn't in our control
Tom won't turn up tonight
Tom won't do you any harm
It was the doctor's call
It needn't have happened
Tom wasn't there for Mary
It hasn't happened a lot
Tom wasn't really shocked
Tom wasn't gaining weight
Is there a return policy?
Is there a middle ground?
Is the response positive?
Is that what it's called?
Is that the correct path?
Is that going to cost me?
Is that appealing to you?
Is it purely coincidence?
Is cost the major factor?
I've really been blessed
I've never understood it
I've lost my best friend
I've lost a great friend
I've fought a good fight
I've come to accept this
I've been very impressed
I've been absurdly lucky
I've always cherished it
I'm tired of high school
I'm taking it day by day
I'm speechless right now
I'm sorry for the mishap
I'm running out of steam
I'm real glad to see you
I'm praying that happens
I'm not the sort to sulk
I'm not going home happy
I'm not finding anything
I'm not afraid to say it
I'm just an old farm boy
I'm in this for the kids
I'm in a unique position
I'm here for three years
I'm going to keep my job
I'm glad to see you, too
I'm glad it's sorted out
I'm finally done working
I'm fighting for my life
I'm feeling very excited
I'm clearly out of touch
I'm as happy as I can be
I'm actually self-taught
I'm a very visual person
I'll take whatever comes
I'll set the dogs on you
I'll continue to improve
I'll be no party to that
I'll answer that for you
Tom was Mary's competitor
I would've played longer
I won't turn anyone away
I won't open this letter
I think it's very doable
I think it's a huge pity
I think I'm equal to you
Tom simply doesn't buy it
I know we'll bounce back
Tom shouldn't be far away
I know that I've changed
I know I didn't cause it
I don't want to say that
I don't want to be messy
I don't need any support
I don't live in the past
I don't know your habits
I don't feel like myself
I don't control anything
I don't care much for it
I don't believe I helped
I didn't think I was old
I didn't see it that way
I didn't plant that bomb
I couldn't put it better
I can't wait to share it
I can't say I blame them
I can't honestly say why
I can't acknowledge that
How much should you save?
How much change occurred?
How many lives were lost?
How long have I been out?
How do worms communicate?
How did we get back here?
How did they manage this?
How can you not trust me?
How can you explain that?
How can we avoid trouble?
How can I reconcile this?
Hey, at least I'm honest
Have I steered you wrong?
Tom likes to micro-manage
French is hard, isn't it?
Don't you dare die on me
Don't stay home and mope
Don't play the race card
Don't be such a sourpuss
Don't be afraid to dance
Does this mean I can win?
Does it affect your work?
Does anyone read anymore?
Do you want my autograph?
Do you remember the code?
Do you need toilet paper?
Do you need medical help?
Do you have five dollars?
Do you have any suspects?
Do you have a death wish?
Do you find that strange?
Tom isn't such a bad sort
Do you expect a backlash?
Do you do your own taxes?
Tom isn't dumber than you
Do we want to contribute?
Do we know anything more?
Tom isn't a normal person
Do we have any leads yet?
Do we go on or turn back?
Do I seem fragile to you?
Did you steal that dress?
Did you just hear voices?
Did you just growl at me?
Did you hear any of that?
Did you hate your mother?
Did you get my stuff yet?
Did you get lots of bids?
Did you fall back asleep?
Did you change your hair?
Did the deal go smoothly?
Did I hear you correctly?
Cut me a break, will you?
Could we raise the money?
Could I get another shot?
Can you buy weapons here?
Can I have a replacement?
Are you willing to learn?
Are you stark raving mad?
Are you some kind of cop?
Are you leaving so early?
Are you just saying that?
Are you here for tickets?
Are you finished with me?
Are you all OK with that?
Are you about to fire me?
Are we that thin-skinned?
Are we allowed back here?
Are they messing with us?
Are they coming this way?
Tom is a good-hearted man
You've done beautifully
You're the ignorant one
You're making me hungry
You're an honorable man
Tom is Mary's new husband
You're a senior partner
You'd do the same thing
You won't do any better
You shouldn't let it go
Tom hasn't left Australia
Yeah, I figured as much
Would you prefer I lied?
Why would God choose me?
Why the change of heart?
Why not join me tonight?
Why not change the size?
Why is that a bad thing?
Why is it so dark today?
Why is God punishing me?
Where are your silk gowns?
I hate that look!
Can you talk more slowly?
Please do not let me down!
Holy Mary!
I can, and I will.
Why don't I have a desk?
Why do we play football?
Why do people lie to me?
Why did you run from me?
Why did I agree to this?
Why can't they see that?
Why are you such a jerk?
Why are we so different?
Who's this I see coming?
Who would've thought it?
Who would notice anyway?
Who would be doing that?
Who needs that headache?
Who can say for certain?
Who are you calling fat?
Which do you value more?
Where shall we go today?
Where does our money go?
What's your plan for me?
What's on tap for today?
What's it going to take?
What was your big break?
What was that last part?
What tribe are you from?
What should we wait for?
What other way is there?
What meeting did I miss?
What does "stress" mean?
What did you boys catch?
What did that feel like?
What could be out there?
What camp did you go to?
What are we drinking to?
What are their policies?
What are their findings?
We've learned to adjust
We've got to prioritize
We've done our research
We've been playing well
We're unsure what to do
We're not here to judge
We're just staying home
We're in a state of war
Tom gave Mary a fist-bump
We're doing fairly well
We're cutting you loose
We're cutting our costs
We're confident as well
We're committed to that
We're close to a crisis
We're changing the rule
We're certainly curious
We're calling the shots
We're a phone call away
We're a nation of sheep
We're a nation of fools
We'll get you the money
We'd love to acquire it
Tom didn't mention Boston
Tom didn't make any noise
Tom didn't have an answer
Tom didn't have a bad day
We needn't have worried
Tom didn't even slow down
We need everyone's vote
Tom couldn't live with it
We have fun here, right?
Tom can't afford anything
We don't want inflation
We don't need more debt
We don't deal with that
We didn't play our best
Was this a game changer?
Was that the right call?
Trust me, you need this
Trust me, it's worth it
Tom and I are like-minded
This isn't a game to me
Take it down a notch, Tom
OK Tom, that should do it
Let's wait around for Tom
It's good to see Tom back
Is Tom taking on too much?
They've come a long way
They're taking too long
Is Tom nervous about that?
They're still out there
They're still good kids
Is Tom getting a raw deal?
They're right behind us
They're not saying that
Is Tom ever in a bad mood?
They're not fairy tales
They're looking into it
They're filthy rich now
I've got some dirt on Tom
I'm so glad Tom was found
I'm not afraid to ask Tom
I'm just glad Tom is home
I'm deeply in debt to Tom
They don't need one yet
They don't listen to us
I'm best friends with Tom
There's no sign of them
There's a reason for it
I'll make Tom sing for us
There's a lot of demand
I'll get it back from Tom
I'd like to meet with Tom
I went into Tom's bedroom
I loved Tom's performance
I couldn't figure Tom out
I couldn't beat Tom today
Did you hear how Tom died?
Are you in touch with Tom?
Who told you to kill Tom?
That's why we oppose it
What makes Tom different?
That's where we are now
That's the problem here
What do you need Tom for?
That's not saying a lot
That's not at all clear
That's not a hate crime
We stand behind you, Tom
Tom's teammates need him
Tom's pleas were ignored
That changed after 2013
Tom's plan is incomplete
Tom's offer was declined
Tom's mother was a nurse
Tom's life was destroyed
So what's our next move?
Tom's leave was canceled
Should we disarm police?
Tom's ideas were extreme
Tom's hard work paid off
Tom's hands were mangled
Tom's got it really good
Tom's got a great future
Tom's eye color is green
Now it's more difficult
Tom wouldn't accept help
Tom won't play this year
Tom won't let go of this
My world's fallen apart
Tom wasn't on the flight
May I ask you one thing?
Tom wasn't helpful to me
Tom wasn't even involved
Let's take a sneak peek
Tom wasn't asking for it
Let's stay calm, people
Just how bad are things?
It's what you asked for
It's what we always say
It's tough to get there
It's too much of a risk
It's the end of a world
It's quite intimidating
It's part of growing up
It's not so much to ask
It's not so easy for us
It's not so bad up here
It's not really a shock

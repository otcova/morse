What a fantastic idea!
I don't joke around
I don't take life lightly
Where did everyone go?
Where is the evidence?
Will that really work?
You're not in trouble
You're really awesome
We still need Tom's help
We should've helped Tom more
Are you free right now?
Are you ready for that?
Do you speak Talossan?
You know that's wrong, right?
Let's do a little exercise
I've brought you a gift
Aren't you going to go?
Don't you have to work?
They called John "King John
May I ask who's speaking?
Oh, if only that were true!
What kind of music?
We're excited
Who'd buy this?
Tom got back at 2:30
It'll burn
Tom got home at 2:30
She's in a good mood
He's in a good mood
I can't read here
What do you see?
I don't know what I expected
Are you sure?
Tom is not in love with me.
Are you sure?
I'm not in love with him
We're just good friends
Is Tom fat?
May I stay here?
You can't buy that
It'll heal
Who should I ask?
He's living a miserable life
I'm sorry, I was distracted
You can't buy this
It'll break
We aren't always right
That's bad karma
Why take chances?
You can't prove it
It'll be hot
Is Tom your name?
Will that change?
You won't enjoy it
Tom helped Mary, too
It'll be scary
What a crazy day!
Tom's dog is well-trained
The other people are idiots!
Is reality really real?
Are ghosts real?
We're blind to our blindness
Don't slump
Don't slump in your chair
I'm the boss now
Could that change?
You're real heroes
Gold isn't cheap
It won't happen
Who did Tom bite?
That isn't French
I'm earning money
It was exactly one o'clock
What are we dealing with here?
Dear Cecil!
Yes!
How did you know?
I'm working on the grammar
Where do you park?
You're wrong again
Let's ignore that
It's not normal
Yes, you're right
Who did Tom save?
Why did I do this?
What kind of music?
You've got to move
It's not pretty
We won't use that
That's just awful
I won't back down
Should I help them?
We're proud of Tom
You've got to wait
Do you have any kind of alibi?
Does Tom like tea?
What a nice family!
We're all retired
Tom isn't doing well
That's my fiancé
I'd love to do it
What does that say?
Chivalry isn't dead
What a total idiot!
What'll I tell Tom?
I'm Jack
We're not healthy
I'm still dubious
What'll it be like?
It's frightening
Yeah, you're right
We've been warned
That isn't complex
My aunt’s house is old
That's all nonsense
Tom should've said yes
I'm not sure if that'll help
I can't sing very well
You shouldn't lie
We've eaten
I've gained weight recently
What'll that solve?
Do you not like Tom?
You can't buy that now
Don't buy that book
That's Tom's book
Yes, we can change
We aren't bluffing
That isn't correct
What'll we call it?
Don't go over there
Maybe it's bad luck
Happy Birthday, Tom
That isn't too bad
This car is Tom's
What's a stem cell?
You're on your own now
Don't hurt yourself
How many times must I say no?
Do you speak Greek?
It's a nice break
Maybe it's not fair
We didn't run away
What's next for us?
Happy New Year, Tom
Everyone's doing it
It's exhilarating
This is Tom's bag
Maybe it's worth it
Do you find me repulsive?
I'll take it if you don't mind
Tom won't be at our party
Why do you say that?
Do you find me repulsive?
No, not all.
Do you find me repulsive?
No, of course not.
Mary is my half-sister
I love Mary's hair
What's your intent?
You can't leave me here
It's quite a mess
Hold me closer, Tom
That's how life is
What'll Tom think?
Who made the rules?
You're hiccupping again
It's so nice here
That's no surprise
Why did you hit me?
I'm glad Mary isn't my wife
You're not very polite
Tom isn't very polite, is he?
We've waited long enough
All right, that's enough
Let us daydream!
What is enough?
Who is sick?
Don't stop!
What did Tom answer?
Dress warmly!
I shouldn't gossip
You're too beautiful
You're home early today
It's still a mess
Who did Tom fight?
Nobody's doing that
Tom says you're cute
That's not complex
Are all swans white?
Here's another idea
It's unacceptable
We think it's fair
That's not correct
Who does Tom like?
Do you want massage?
It didn't feel bad
That's not too bad
Isn't that your job?
You're a horrible singer
That's quite a bit
You want to know about sumo?
Here's the champion
That's how strong he is
Why is this thing expensive?
Should I sell these?
You're an absolute idiot
Bring your kids, too
Pitching isn't easy
That's really hard
Tom was born in 2013
What did Tom build?
Do you have a sister?
Did Ken beat you up?
Was it Tom who beat you up?
Who beat you up?
Is this a wig or a wiglet?
You're like an old woman
Don't buy that stuff
Mary doesn't wear makeup
It'll be very hard
Tom wasn't even hurt
We'll all miss you
That's tough to do
How was last weekend?
It'll never change
What did Tom paint?
We'll be home soon
That's what I hope
I'd advise caution
Is Boston a big city?
It'll rain tonight
What'll you tell Tom?
Am I Jewish?
We'll get it fixed
I don't hate anyone
What's your username?
You know that's the truth
Tom won't get scared
It'll soon be dark
Tom wouldn't help us
We'll look at that
That's what I wish
Can you see the stars tonight?
I know that he's Tom
Just go ahead!
We can't satisfy everyone
We're extremely concerned
Tom didn't get up early enough
They're our brothers
We've worked so hard
There's only one way out
I'm sorry I made you worry
We aren't competitive
I've got a package for you
That doesn't belong to us
Tom helped me, too
Tom is a boy at Mary's school
That store closed in 2013
I didn't recognize that guy
Who did Tom run away with?
Tom is Mary's current husband
He's an Ecuadorian
I'd like to bring that
Tom didn't understand me
That woman's name is Mary
Does Tom have a dictionary?
We don't want to lose
Tom hasn't decided what to do
I just can't resist chocolate
Say it in Russian!
Say it in Hungarian!
How does Tom get to school?
The pain hasn't gone away
How will Tom feel about it?
Tom doesn't go to church
This doesn't happen often
Say it in Greek!
We learned a lot, too
Tom doesn't have to work
I ate a hamburger at Tom's
Tom doesn't like oranges
Tom doesn't miss a thing
How big is Massachusetts ?
How high is Guadalupe Peak ?
How large is Alaska ?
How long is Rio Grande ?
What state is Pittsburgh in?
Tom doesn't seem so well
I would've liked to do that
The fight didn't last long
I'll be ready to go by 2:30
I'll show you what I can do
These things aren't needed
Tom has lost almost 30 pounds
I'm glad you know the truth
What does Tom mean by that?
How will I go on without you?
I've never loved you
I'm going to need more help
Things weren't always easy
What happened to Tom's car?
I'm going to need some data
This isn't easy to do well
We'll be here waiting
I'm not really that thirsty
When does Tom go to school?
That's all I needed to hear
Tom has been there since 2013
We're all from Boston
I'm not really very thirsty
We're an active group
Did Tom speak French to you?
I'm not satisfied with this
We're both very tired
I'm not the least bit tired
How many cars does Tom have?
There's a bomb on the plane
Tom has a funny-looking mouth
We're both very upset
I'm sorry about what I said
We're not competitive
This is what it's all about
I've got one just like that
That could happen to me, too
What does he really believe?
What does she really believe?
What do they really believe?
I defy you to prove I'm wrong
We're not engaged yet
Tom has long, curly hair
That feeling won't last long
We're not good enough
That's physically impossible
I can't see anything in here
Tom hasn't done anything
We're quite confident
Remember when Tom was funny?
I didn't do anything special
Tom isn't a smoker
We're still improving
I didn't see anything at all
We're still in Boston
I don't know the whole truth
Tom died in Australia in 2013
They're all going to prison
Don't waste ammunition
Don't waste your ammunition
Mercy!
We're still very busy
That's not why Tom resigned
There's nothing to negotiate
Tom didn't take his shoes off
They weren't speaking French
We're trying our best
Tom didn't have a good answer
They're able to speak French
I think I'll get what I need
Tom didn't give his real name
We're very particular
I can't swim well
I hate broccoli!
Which solution is the best?
Which solution is best?
I think I've changed my mind
We're very, very busy
We're glad to have Tom back
That doesn't seem right to me
Tom lived to be 93
We've been quite busy
That was somebody else's idea
We're glad to have Tom here
That's a pretty good question
Look, what a nice team!
Look, what a beautiful moon!
She'll be fine
We've been very lucky
Tom likes chocolate, too
That's just the way I like it
We've had a good time
Are you sure Tom can do that?
We've talked about it
There's a lot of room in here
Tom's son was very rude to me
How many times did she call?
Just a minute, please
Don't hang up
What a wonderful view!
Did you have a good trip?
I put it, and you take it
Why?
Tom hasn't helped the poor
Tom didn't help the poor
Even Tom failed today's exam
Tom says he's having fun
This gun doesn't belong to me
We've waited too long
I'm not going to let Tom die
I'll assist in any way I can
Tom will be home by 2:30
I'm sure Tom would've agreed
I'll wait for you in the car
I'm sure we'll see Tom again
I'm aware of what's going on
I'm gonna take you there
Is the news good or bad?
Why are you grumbling again?
This text is all Greek to me!
I'm certain that we'll do it
Tom didn't even help Mary
That's just how Tom wants it
I'm going to need more money
Tom didn't even love Mary
We can dream, can't we?
Tom didn't let me do that
This isn't Tom's first rodeo
I'm no longer afraid of dogs
Tom said he'd come
We can't do everything
We haven't talked to Tom yet
I'm not sure what this means
We didn't win the game
I'm on my way to the station
You're always in my heart
It'll all be over soon
I'm really pleased with that
I'm sorry I didn't trust you
I've got too much work to do
I'd rather look at the news.
But Tom, you're only six
Just be that and enjoy it!
We hope you'll join us
I didn't see the light change
Don't forget to tell Tom that
I don't think we can eat this
We know it'll be tough
Has Tom been doing his chores?
Don't forget to tell Tom this
I had a feeling you'd be here
We know you're in pain
The man's name is Tom Jackson
I just can't wait to get home
Tom isn't a history major
Tom isn't as fast as I am
We haven't seen Tom for weeks
Tom isn't eating an apple
Tom wasn't healthy
Tom saw Mary's smile
Don't grovel
Tom isn't fit for the job
I just need to know you're OK
Tom isn't good at cooking
Tom knows Mary isn't here
We're going to miss Tom a lot
Tom likes what we've done
We're not going to let Tom go
Are you going to be sick?
Just who do you think you are?
Could I not respond?
I can't go to the party
I'm grounded
I don't know what Tom would do
I'll probably be home by 2:30
I'm glad you appreciated that
We think it isn't fair
I'm going to put a stop to it
It was very dark in Tom's room
We think it's not fair
I'm never going to race again
I'm sure I left the door open
I'm tired of all the fighting
I'm trying to do what's right
Tom won't like doing that
I'm willing to try new things
I've got a headache right now
I've had an extraordinary day
I can't make any more mistakes
I don't know that woman at all
We'll be there by 2:30
I don't know why this happened
We'll keep you updated
I don't think you can eat that
We'll never meet again
I don't think you'll like that
We'll talk things over
Tom didn't even touch Mary
We'll think about that
I have no idea what's going on
We're better than that
I haven't cried in a long time
We're better than this
I haven't done that in a while
We're both very hungry
Tom doesn't belong in jail
We're both very sleepy
I hope that won't happen again
We're considering that
We're doing quite well
I really don't know those guys
We're going to rebuild
We're here on vacation
Tom hasn't been seen since
We're not always right
We're not disappointed
We're not millionaires
We're not the majority
I'd like to know more about it
Tom gets up at 6:30
We're not your parents
I'll probably be out all night
We're pretty confident
I don't think you'll like this
Essentially, it's a big house
I don't understand this word
Could you explain it to me?
I'm very sorry for the mistake
We're sharing the cost
I've got one like that already
We're still having fun
We're very, very angry
Tom isn't that kind of guy
Tom isn't too young, is he?
Don't abuse my patience
We don't do it that way
Tom liked Mary's new dress
We don't need this here
Have a heart!
Don't worry
We'll succeed
Have faith!
Tom really didn't say much
Tom said he won't marry me
We haven't even started
That's true.
I think this place is better.
The hen's chicks are hatching
We haven't said yes yet
Tom says he didn't do that
We haven't talked since
We just couldn't say no
Tom still loves me, I hope
Tom was a friend of Mary's
We know who's out there
Tom wasn't always this way
Tom's problems aren't over
Tom is an old-timer
Tom couldn't bear the noise
We still don't know why
Tom didn't even speak to me
Tom didn't get on the train
Tom doesn't need comforting
We weren't disappointed
Don't laugh at my mistake
We'd like to start over
We'll figure things out
We'll keep you informed
Tom isn't that cute
We'll take a look at it
We're ahead of schedule
Ouch!
I don't feel up for it
We're all created equal
We're all like brothers
We're doing it together
We're doing really well
We're feeling confident
We're going to fix that
We're just disappointed
We're leaving next year
Tom says he isn't giving up
We're leaving right now
Tom says he's a changed man
We're still pretty busy
We're telling the truth
We're very, very hungry
We've all made mistakes
We've been very patient
We've got a job for you
We've had no complaints
We've heard this before
We've made some changes
Tom won't be there, will he?
We can't do such a thing
Tom won't take me seriously
We can't keep doing that
Tom wouldn't let me do that
We didn't play that well
We don't censor anything
We don't know enough yet
Tom could've been badly hurt
We don't want to rush it
Tom could've broken his neck
Tom could've died that night
Tom could've had a long life
Tom could've told me earlier
I am not gay !
The fewer who know, the better
Child can't talk bad word !
Tom's mother yelled
Tom didn't join us for lunch
Tom doesn't have any sisters
Tom doesn't like being alone
I don't love myself
Enough arguing!
What would you like for lunch?
Mackerel or sardine?
Kid!
Can't you hear?
My, my!
Really?
I had no idea!
Where should I go on vacation?
I'm rolling in dough
That guy's rolling in dough
He's rolling in dough
She's rolling in dough
They're rolling in dough
We're rolling in dough
I'm raking in the cash
He's raking in the cash
She's raking in the cash
Don't bother
It's a waste of time
When are we going to eat?
I'll eat a preserved egg
I'll eat a hundred-year egg
I'll eat a millennium egg
When do we eat?
What do I care about Tom?
He's your only son, at least.
A son I would gladly give up.
Tom doesn't work hard enough
We think we're too early
We won't change anything
We'd be foolish to do so
We'd never consider that
We'll do our best to win
We'll try to do our best
We're a little different
We're basketball players
We're concerned about it
We're excited about that
We're happy with our car
We're having so much fun
We're leaving right away
We're not hurting anyone
We're pretty competitive
Tom is Mary's French teacher
We're very well prepared
Tom won't live long
We've got a lot to offer
Tom is afraid of me, I think
We've got to get it done
We've learned a lot, too
Tom isn't taking any chances
We've made many mistakes
We've still got a chance
Tom isn't too old to do that
We all know it won't work
Tom isn't very bright at all
Tom isn't very likely to win
We aren't quite there yet
We can't take that chance
We couldn't find anything
We couldn't stay together
We didn't know who he was
We don't do it very often
We don't know what it was
We don't know where to go
We don't need this at all
Tom really liked me, I think
We don't need to go there
We don't want any excuses
We don't want that, do we?
We don't want you with us
What a wonderful town!
Why was he living in the US?
What animal is that?
What paint do you prefer?
Tom can't tell jokes
Tom didn't play well
Tom doesn't eat beef
Tom won't even speak to Mary
We weren't expecting this
We'll definitely be ready
I don't really mind
Tom's family is here
So what'll happen now?
Tom's opinion counts
It's something new
Did Tom have dinner?
We'll make changes
That's what we did
You'd better stick around
I am completely lost!
It's the same wine
We'll soon be home
That's what we got
What are you sorry for?
Don't count Tom out
You don't trust me, do you?
It's very slippery
We're a big family
Tom doesn't sing well
That's what we saw
What's that book about?
Tom doesn't tell lies
Go and help them, Tom
Everybody's in position
It didn't look good
Is Tom running away?
We're a great team
That's why we care
I'm lucky I'm alive
Who would've done this?
Everything's in the car
It didn't seem real
We're all watching
That's worth a lot
I've heard about it
Who'd buy one of those?
Is Tom your brother?
It didn't take long
We're all worn out
The job's not done
Who's going to be next?
It doesn't worry me
Mary was Tom's wife
We're not bluffing
They don't need us
I don't own a violin
Mary is cute.
So is Alice.
Don't you agree with me?
We're not doing it
Everyone is here, right?
You probably can't do that
At first, it wasn't easy
Mary doesn't carry a purse
We're not offended
Is that a boy or a girl?
You're just making excuses
That's how Tom died
We're not quitters
Were you waiting for me?
It wasn't so simple
We're not stopping
Why are you in my house?
That's what Tom did
You shouldn't drive so fast
We're not stubborn
Tom knows what's good
Why did you buy so much?
You shouldn't have run away
Don't leave me like this
It'll be ready soon
That's why Tom left
We're pretty happy
Would you like to start?
You've had a very busy week
Let's have another drink
It'll be really fun
We're real excited
I'd like to forget Tom
They won't fire me
Tom plays tennis, too
Are you also from Boston?
What would Tom pack?
It'll clear up soon
We're saving lives
They'll get caught
I've had a good time
Are you from Boston, too?
You love this car, don't you?
I'm going out with Tom
At least, no one was hurt
It'll get warm soon
What'll Tom do next?
We're sure of that
They'll never know
I agree with you 100%
My girlfriend's name is Mary
Can I borrow an umbrella?
It'll rain tomorrow
Please say you're kidding
We're taking turns
Let's go say hi to Tom
They're both crazy
I can't go home again
Do you want me to decide?
When does Tom study?
It's actually funny
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Pretend you didn't see me
We're very hopeful
They're just human
Tom is a yes-man
I think we'll be fine
Don't you know the truth?
You're an artist, aren't you?
Everybody's looking at me
It's almost October
Where does Tom work?
We've been patient
Mary doesn't like parsley
She's making parsley tea
They're tough guys
Haven't you finished yet?
You can't buy these in Boston
It's almost perfect
Quit before it's too late
We've changed that
That boy's name is Tom
They're tough kids
How did you get so dirty?
Where's Tom playing?
You clearly aren't very happy
Give me that book, please
It's not you I hate
Running a farm isn't easy
We've got a chance
They're very happy
I don't know this road
Is it hot enough for you?
You could've been really hurt
When I'm rich, I'll buy a farm
It'll be spring soon
Some people can't do that
Why didn't Tom wait?
We've had some fun
I don't recognize them
May I borrow an umbrella?
Therefore, he is untouchable
Some people can't do this
I know you're talented
What kind of plane is it?
You haven't seen anything yet
It'll be a long night
Tom will come at 2:30
Tom isn't a hero
Where are the other guys?
Tom's car caught fire
You love Christmas, don't you?
It'll get warmer soon
Why didn't you slow down?
You understand why, don't you?
Driving a truck isn't easy
Tom isn't in now
It'll only get better
I'm feeling sad for Tom
This isn't logical
Why didn't you take that?
I love Tom's cooking
You'd better go back to class
Well, I must be off.
So soon?
Yes, I'm afraid so
Toodle-oo.
Don't you have any more?
It'll soon be October
We can't fail again
I see you're all awake
Why has it taken so long?
Tom didn't like school
I've never heard of Tom
Let's sing that song again
It'll be fine tomorrow
Tom doesn't have a gun
Are you busy at work?
Is Tom available now?
That isn't accurate
Are you getting a new car?
It's a monumental task
What happened wasn't right
We didn't back down
That isn't my fault
Are you giving up so soon?
That's Tom's problem
You should've practiced harder
It's so hard to choose
Maybe we'll try again later
We didn't expect it
That isn't our goal
I won't practice today
Are you looking for these?
You'd better get back to class
Their son's name is Tom
Let's go back to the garage
It's so hard to decide
That's all Tom needs
We don't lose often
That isn't the plan
Are you sure you'll be OK?
Let's go back to your house
It'll be very, very hot
Tom hasn't paid us yet
That's what Tom does
That isn't the same
I'll fix it right away
Are you the hotel manager?
It'll cool down tonight
People don't want the truth
We haven't lost yet
Where was Tom killed?
Didn't you read the story?
Don't take their word for it
It'll stop raining soon
Perhaps it'll rain tomorrow
We hope we're wrong
That's a big change
I can't get out of here
Do you have your own room?
Let's split a bottle of wine
It's been raining a lot
Please don't mention my age
What nationality is Tom?
That's a great deal
I can't move any faster
Tom isn't a clever boy
Because you are an idiot!
Your nose is running!
Don't you like that smell?
Is Tom playing tennis?
Tom isn't your brother
It's my turn to do that
That's a real shame
I can't wait to go home
How long were you in jail?
Is Tom your real name?
Let's wreck him
It's really challenging
That's a true story
I didn't do it that way
Hello, everyone, I'm Tom
Is it really your day off?
Remember Tom's advice
That's affecting me
What are those kids doing?
This is Tom's bicycle
That's all you need
What's wrong with all of you?
I can't really trust Tom
It wasn't anything fancy
Most people don't enjoy this
Does Tom run every day?
That's helped a lot
Where do you usually park?
Tom must've lied to us
Flying a helicopter isn't easy
It'll be cloudy tomorrow
We waited till 2:30
Does Tom teach history?
That's how it began
Who do you think's wrong?
He's intelligent, but not wise
She's not easy to impress
He's easy to impress
I can see you're upset
What's wrong?
Are you taking notes?
Is it that obvious?
It's about time to leave
That's how it works
I didn't know Tom died
Who else would've done it?
Let's see what's wrong with it
So what's wrong with my idea?
Is it OK if we swim here?
May we swim here?
That's just a start
Who wants to cut the cake?
Let's take a closer look at it
Maybe there's something wrong
Tom stole Mary's watch
I'll always remember Tom
Why don't you help me now?
It'll be over in a minute
That's not a choice
I think I'm really sick
Why has the train stopped?
It'll be over in a moment
We'll find out soon
That's not accurate
I thought I'd better go
Would you please sit down?
We're friends of Tom's
It's good to see you, too
We'll never give up
That's not changing
I told you I'm the best
Would you please stand up?
It's hard to stop smoking
Where was Tom tortured?
Can I copy your notes?
I'm sure Mary wouldn't mind
I couldn't help staring at her
I couldn't help staring at Tom
We'll talk about it
That's not our goal
Are you ready for the race?

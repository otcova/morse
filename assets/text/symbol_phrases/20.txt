Ziri's hands are filthy
The barking dog doesn't bite
Ziri isn't doing good
Ziri was a middle-aged man
Suddenly, Ziri's phone buzzed
Ziri's Berber class is amazing
Ziri won't miss anything new
Are we there yet?
Not yet.
The timing wasn't very good
That wasn't very good timing
He drove thirty-six kilometers
Marie didn't take a nap
We're from Spain
They're off of school tomorrow
Luckily, Mary doesn't smoke
You don't feel like doing it
Sorry!
There's none left
I'll take a nap
Mary has pre-wedding jitters
Do you fast?
Guys, look!
A birdie!
I'll leave the rest up to you
My God, do you mean that?
She's eating ice cream
She's a shark
Let's get back together.
It's nice to see you here
He's such a computer geek
I don't want to depend on you
Many people think I'm childish
Did you have a good Easter?
He's eating vanilla ice cream
Winter's coming
Will two be enough?
He's almost always home
I'm asking you one last time
You're wasting your talent
I don't want him here
Who inherited the ring?
Wow!
Are you serious?
Wow!
Are you being serious?
I don't like Marta anymore
Close your doors, please
Good job girl!
It was hot today, wasn't it?
Wasn’t it hot, yesterday?
You, what do you think?
Did you come from Paris?
But why do you envy me?
Should we greet Mary?
Did you finish your homework?
I did.
What did you do?
I think Tom might've run away
It's hard to get good help
Oh, that's all right, Tom
Business is business, you know
Well, what did you see?
I've never been to New Zealand
Who wrote this?
I did.
Who wrote this report?

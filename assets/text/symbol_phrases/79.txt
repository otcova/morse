Man, you're something!
I can't deny it

Taking you for an idiot?

Dying's nothing
Sing us another song!
Don't come late, okay?
If you want to go, then go
If you want to go, then go

I've got a plastic cup
I've got a few friends
I didn't want that to happen
I didn't want that
Yes, I'm in a hurry
Yes, I'm in a rush
Are you in a rush?
Gold's heavier than iron

This suit's too thin for me
Maybe you're right, after all

What did they hit you with?
Here's the Robert's reply.
You mean Robert's?
No, it's the Robert
There's only one.

You think that it will work?
I dare say that he's right
He met her while in the U.S
That's the law
Yesterday, I bought a book
My father's in the garden

Are you happy now?
My father's a doctor
One's new
The other's old
Vacation's already over
I never said that!
He's standing before the door
I'll bring you happiness
Until he comes, I can't go
I'll keep it in mind
Come again another day.
You've got no class
It's getting on my nerves
Go on!
Good night, everybody!
Where are you going, Mom?
Where can I speak with you?
Who died?
His little dog.

That book's over here
Life's short, so I use Python!
I hope you'll get better soon

And how?
And why?

You've got a lot of willpower
You've got a strong will
Is there any zakuska?
He doesn't really speak French
I'm out of it
You're a bachelor too?
We don't have any other choice
We don't have another choice
I guess it's only a joke

Thanks, guys.
Don't mention it.
I'll go with you when pigs fly
You're an idiot!
Should we iron a poem?

I'm really scared!
I'm gone
I'm off
Did you go out?
You don't need to tell me
Did you guys go out?
Idiot..
How many accounts do you have?
Funny..
It's raining outside
What you said is wrong.
Then what should I say?
I'm all washed up
When will you be online?
You get out of class?

It's all right
What time is class for you?
Dinner's ready already
When are you going to be home?
When are you getting off work?
How about you?
You're still up?
You're still awake?
I'm pretty hungry
When can we go have lunch?
Hopefully I'll pass
Why is my memory so bad?
I'm always forgetting things!
I'm sick, and it's miserable!
You shouldn't forget to sleep
The food's ready
I'm in bed
When did you tell me?
Hurry up!

Which one is you?
Mr. Smith is drinking coffee
I'm certain that you saw Tom
She's not sleepy
My neighbor's a real mysophobe
You asked about her?
What did she say?
It's because it's too big
She's wearing red
I'll be glad to help!
Do you like to play golf?
Is it really everywhere?
There's a band at my school
So how have you guys been?

Don't say bullshit!
And you?
My family's well
And how about all of yours?
We're definitely going
You?
Naturally.
Of course.
Where'd you come from?
Straight from Urumqi.
Otherwise, you'll be late
Thank you so much!
I'll be back shortly
There's just one day left
There's only a day left
There's a day left

That guy's really lazy
As far as I go, I'm a cook
It's no big deal if I lose
So what if I lost?
Summer vacation?
It's unbelievably beautiful!
Shall we go to Lithuania?
How come you didn't come?
This is clearly Emet!
It's such a small thing
Why isn't he coming out?
Don't know
Something's keeping him there.
Why didn't he say anything?
Who knows..
He just didn't.
I said there's no one here
I'd say that I came on time
Speak Italian!
I can't understand German
Is this man your friend?
Might this man be your friend?
So is this man your friend?
You're a doctor, right?
You're the repairmen, right?
That can't be right, can it?
You know that's not right
Might that not be right?
So is that not right?
I wonder if that's not right?
I didn't understand
Come on, hurry up
You'll miss the bus
Well, ask!
Hey, listen!
Just wait!
Stand for a bit, okay?!
How pretty!
That guy is so tall!
Does this car belong to you?!
Do you think that that's okay?
Nobody wants your books!

It's a big dog
Best regards, Silja
What does he need?
What must he have?
You don't need to thank me
You're not obliged to thank me
I don't need a car
You shouldn't do that
You shouldn't have gone
How should I say this to her?
Why did you return home today?
For our friendship!
Did you call me today?
Will you buy something?
It didn't actually happen
It's not blood - it's ketchup
I know that you're very angry
Wow, that girl's gorgeous!
My is it cloudy today!
Wow!
He can't do anything else

It just doesn't work
I'm sorry
I've come here before

I wish!
Can you send me a screenshot?
I want to die!
Hear, O Israel!
Listen, Israel!
We'll return home tomorrow
Thank you, my child
That's your car
You're very good-natured
What are your thoughts?
With pleasure!
We don't give a fuck
I'll talk about you
We've got a good life
How are your studies?
Do you rest on Sundays?
Forgive me, Brother
I'm Melanie
You've got some cheek!
You'll do it yourself
Are you a teacher?
Happy Qurban!
You as well, thank you.
Don't go praising yourself
I'm at home right now
Is this your money?
The grown-ups know
Let's go at around five
Emet's about fifty now
It's about seven thirty
I definitely don't know them
You're the reason I came
Emet doesn't like that woman
Has Tom lost his reason?
Can they die?
Does she own a pet?
Does he own a pet?
This looks awesome!
I'm looking for a stick
What an amazing goal!

Is it a bird?
My friend's name is Swati
I'll get around to it soon

I'm fed up with it!
That's why I went
If I could see her, I would
Here we come!
Are you straight or gay?
I'm straight.
Do you know how to speak?
She's gonna be okay
Hurray for Italian women!
Thank God you're fine

Is my Italian so bad?
Where is this place?
Hmm? ...Shit!
Damn, that was awful.

I'll teach him some manners
We'll meet wherever you want
I can't lose!

He's got pneumonia
Don't even get your hopes up
No, there was no belief.
Mary: "Sorry?
Let's get the fuck out of here
Could it have a future?
Away with you!

How did she get in here?
Tom doesn't buy bread
Tom isn't buying bread

Eat a lot!
Look!
A flying cockroach!
Which singer do you like?
He didn't answer at first
I've been very busy recently
Life is pain, princess
I'm currently training a dog
I can't handle his comments
Don't think about him
How about the food I ordered?
Should I tell?
He studies Chinese, too
She's learning Chinese, too
What day was yesterday?
Do you study?
Do you know my age?
I don't wanna know this
I don't want to know this
Please do not let me down!
Which is the healthier food?
Won't you come to my house?
It's a village

You mustn't talk now
Sami's support never wavered
We don't share that opinion
Who told him?
Let's give it a try!
Let's try and see!
How come you're awake, Tom?
I got up early to see you.
Let's help each other!
Do you know what this is?
No.
It's a discarded condom.
Change the child's nappy
The lady's wish is my command
Where's Mary?
That's a bad translation
That's a big table
Beware of her!
Can raw meat be fed to cats?
Do cats' claws need trimming?
It's a bit late.
Not late for me.
Do you see my car?
Tomato, tomato
Sami's a waiter at a gay bar
Do I look busy?
A chilly wind's blowing
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Tom!
What have you done?
It isn't a bug
It's an undocumented feature
Sami's a weirdo
She's very crazy
Do you use the solvent?
Sami's curiosity was piqued
It's the original
This umbrella cost me $30
You don't know shit about me
You vomited?
It's the foghorn I hate
It won't let you alone
I am going to eat!
Aren't you Mary?
I'm not Mary, I'm Marie!
I'm 165 centimeters tall
She remembers Mr. Black's car
Sorry, I couldn't find my seat
Also, I love you
Hi, I hope you are well
When does the school year end?
Which scientist said that?
Whose car is this?
It's Tom's.
So late!
What are humans doing!!
No, no, and no!
Why not?
You're only fifteen!
How can I improve my English?
Are we eating dinner?
I don't like renegades
It's cold here even in summer
How long do alligators live?
It's an ancient aqueduct
“Look at them!
Who committed that crime?
I'll take it with me
You know it, and I know it
You don't have a car
Coffee?
We aren't taking any chances
I can't ride this horse
What a disorder!
She's your niece, isn't she?
What kind of sport do you do?
Has he been learning English?
Don’t you see a little fox?
How can I do that?
He's going to eat an apple!
Did you bring it?
A lot think they're rising
He's taking care of it
I would love to see your son!
Oh!!
I just saw an apparition!!
Do you feel well or unwell?
Let's wash the car
Mary's legs are swollen
Who will open the door?
We could hardly wait!
Eight brothers and no sisters?
No wonder she's a tomboy
Nine planets, isn't it?
I never liked him, anyway
I never liked him, anyways
Then Mary started singing, too
You said you couldn't hear her
Suppose we didn't
Mary smiles when she's nervous
Have you finished that one?
We can read it when he's done
I can't think of any right now
Don't buy a pig in a poke
Find yourself another stooge!
Excuse me..
That's a fat lie!
What is this doohickey?
Tom thought it was delicious.
He's going to watch a movie
Paint, please
Kudos!
Did you calm down?
Will you get me some coffee?
Stop the engine!
Berber.
Pardon me?
He was shouting in Berber.
“Trick or treat!
Don't do that!
That's gross
What's the point?
It's past three
I should be tired, but I'm not
It's late, so I should go
I'm not saying you’re wrong
It's the crunchiest part
I'm on the same boat as you
Did he touch your butt?
He's around my age
It's so damn warm
It's not safe
She can't orgasm
It's a provocative dance
I think I'm gonna throw up
They're countless
They're too many to count
He won't finish it today
I can't guarantee you that
I'd like to sleep better
The fan won't stop
You can't stop inside a tunnel
It's a tricky road
She's a very famous person
She's a very well-known person
She's very famous
She's very well-known
Surely it's closed by now
How much did you buy it for?
About 20 euros.
That cheap?
Really?
They've had a nightmare
Cicero's glory began to grow
What does this look like?
A sad man.
He's like a Greek god
I'm not queer
Do I turn you on?
You're it.
Aha, gotcha!
Ahh!
Don't eat me, I'm too skinny!
Mary tastes better!
Tom, you traitor!
No, I'm fine
You're sweating
It's a hot summer's day
Don’t mind Tom
It's so huge
Do you like my ass?
You make me so fucking horny!
Don't repress your emotions
Clench your butt-cheeks
She's farting all the time
I'm having my period
I'm addicted to cocks
I'm a dominant top
He's gay, but closeted
They're not Chinese
We're not Russian
Where's the nearest pharmacy?
I'm not ugly
Tom, it's me
Can I talk with you?
Tom, it's me
Can we talk?
What time is it?
Do you still want it?
That's not celebrating
That's just showboating
I don't like being on a diet
Tom can't tie his own tie
Where are you?
I'm here.
Let's go to the kitchen
I’ll make us some coffee
You're not Spanish
She's not South Korean
He's not South Korean
We're English
You're Chinese
I didn't eat any more rice
I'm allergic to cat hair
Does this work?
No, it won't fit.
She didn't eat
It's five minutes to ten
Isn't your mother home?
He's an angelic boy
Which translation is better?
I know, right?
She's a sleepyhead.
Shibuya Station?
It's not far at all from here
What's in China?
You don't enjoy my jokes
What's in the shop?
Nothing!
I'm talking and feeling well
You wanna fight me?!
What's both a sun and a moon?
How did she do what?
What's holy to you?
What's sacred to animals?
What do lizards value?
What knowledge is unnecessary?
You're not relevant
You're irrelevant
I managed to have sex!
I'm in a black house
We're in an unlit room
There's a fly inside the fruit
This apple is this fly's house
I hope they shut up!
I hope they stop talking!
I'm going to it
I'm travelling to her
We're on our way to him
I'm just setting out!
What do you find horrid?
We don't have to
Tomorrow is a big day for you!
I'm finding it similar as well
This is an eye-socket
I can sleep anywhere, anytime
Do you see me in your dreams?
I'm beside this
Latin.
I'll teach you!
I don’t hear a thing
Don't use bad tools
Light doesn’t know of darkness
Tom doesn't like football
Do you obey your mother?
I'm so happy that you've come
I'm broke
You're loaded
But they're feeling good
How much fruit did you eat?
Two Maultaschen!
I came, I saw, I won
Look!
The cat's in the kitchen!
May I use the chair here?
You'll write a letter
Shit!
Stop!
You're staying strong
You’re a beastly person!
The community’s good
The machine's running
I'm alive!
That's revolting
I'm going insane!
You look wretched!
What is communication?
I amn't looking
It's nice to chat
We're going to the bottom
Hey hey hey!
Listen, you
You're handsome!
My ladder's banjaxed
Drink some fresh water!
It can’t be this small
Where was this book made?
Gimme a kiss!
Everyone's my enemy
I'll talk about French
I've barely seen it
Can I eat some fruit?
Don't do that again!
Did they have cars?
What's my jacket worth?
Go inside!
Do you want to buy it or not?
Does she work in a team?
Is the machine running?
Mary's always up for a laugh
Who's feeling the same?
He's in solitary confinement
Mary isn't my daughter
She's my wife.
Tom, that's outrageous!
That's a spice
I'm entirely alone
I'm a humble guy
It's finished!
The cat's cold
That's unnecessary!
Everything's disgusting
The fruit's round
You don't love
I'm plenty strong!
You did what to it?
That's my pet
That's definitely the case
I'm going to fight you
When'll the moon be up?
What language is Esperanto?
Talk, dad!
I'm on the lookout for you
I mixed up milk!
The past can't be changed
I don't hate you anymore
I wish I'd told her not to go
How small is that?
What's not a battle to you?
My brain's checked out
Would you like to have it?
Ah, well, that's my secret!
What's for dessert today?
It's what Grandad wanted.
Nevertheless, he quit the job
I'm going to repair to my room
That's just Tom being Tom
It's summer in Paris
It's our bus
Fancy a bite to eat?
You're so contrary!
Fancy a cup of tea?
Do you have a bucket list?
Will I have time?
I'll get a tea
Let me know when Tom's on
Sure, I'm free Monday
I can do Monday at 2:30

I don't think he is right
I don't think she is right
Enjoy the party until the end!
He's better than me at math
I don't know what to tell you
You're not my father
I'm not from this world
You're very smart
I'm really old
I'm a great singer
This is my brother's
I'm always sneezing
I'm sneezing all the time
That's my teacher

I'm going to tell everybody
Good evening, everyone

I'm meeting someone for dinner
Is someone meeting us?
Is there someone with you?
Is Tom someone special?
There's somebody in the tunnel
There's someone behind Tom
Why didn't somebody call me?
Why didn't someone help Tom?
Why didn't somebody tell Tom?
Why didn't you call somebody?
Won't somebody please help me?
Someone's knocking on the door
Somebody's made a mistake
Someone stole Tom's guitar
Mmm, hot chocolate!
So, I dislike root beer
I can't remember the question
I'm tired and hungry
I am slightly ill, I assume
E-mail, in particular
I'm going to bed for real
Again, hello
I told you, I disagree
That's probably not so
Right, I see
But it's complicated
Why is that so?
What are you talking about?!
I suggest using "vehicle door
In short, try Dict
Do you feel like dancing?
I don't know what this is
That's right, yes
No, I don't know such word
A silly example, we might say
They think I'm a millionaire
Which table?
I see, you were joking
I understand, you were joking
Is this enough?
Thank you, friend
Stupid brain!
Yum, this food is delicious!
Gulp!
You're faster than this
Damn, she's HOT!
Hatred and resentment?
Well that's unheard of
It's unheard of
It's not here
Heh heh, not enough
Yay you!
Ugh, my internet hates me
I'm late with my period
I'm talking to you, my peers
Where's your father now?
I can't whistle
I'm going to keep your secret
He doesn't remember me anymore
Answer as soon as possible!
What happened to me?
Am I sick?
Tom's not into mathematics
Look!
It's snowing!
That's my intention
Hey!
Everybody get in line!
Follow me!
Yay, but ugh for caffeine!
I don't find that very funny
Holy fucking shit!
My old ex is a thief!
That's so awful!
You poor thing!
What are you ill with?
I'm not asleep, meh
Such as?
Heh, Camgusmis said "Lobjan
However, it's very problematic
Hahaha!
Do you want to kill all flies?
Pardon me, ma'am. - Yes?
Have a nice day!
Welcome, John!
Grr!
Are we mad squirrels?
Tom doesn't like chess
I'm innocent, I swear
Don't speak too loud
You'll wake her up
Do you know where she went?
Hey, John, look at this
At ease, soldiers
Oh, I found it, nevermind
What did you say?
I didn't hear
Thank you very much!
It's beautiful
Hi, John. - I'm not John
What's your location?
And what did they tell me?
Umm..
This stinks!
Please don't feed the animals
Yes?
What were you looking for?
Just wait a minute, please
You're like a machine
What?
What is it?
What's the matter?
Thank you very much, everyone
Thank you very much, everybody
Opaque?
How many soldiers did you see?

Get out of here!
I'll do it myself
So what are you suggesting?
So what do you suggest?
And who said it would be easy?
Well, what?
And if so, what then?
I'm eating everything
He thinks I'm in love with her
In fact, I was born in Boston
I can't do it alone
We've been through three wars
We've endured three wars
I wanted to know, too
This is discrimination!
Let's not forget human rights
You eat lobster for Christmas?
Are you serious?
A tie maybe?
Why?
Why not?
You slept with her!
I did not.
You slept with her?
Are you sleeping with her?
You screwed her?
Did you sleep with her?
Did you sleep with that woman?
Time passes too quickly!
Shall I tell them the truth?
When will she get home?
Have you seen my passport?
He is quiet, but loyal
I'm looking for my passport
Have you seen it?
I'm looking for my keys
Have you seen them?
I'm looking for my wallet
Have you seen it?
Well, it is a done deal
What the heck are you doing?
I've lived here for 10 years
I'm not your enemy
What time is it over there?
What's the time on your side?
I'm in denial
I'm testing it now
Not yet, it isn't

Why?
Because he's your dad.
I don't blame Yanni one bit
Your sister ruined everything.
I can't argue with you there.
Tom wasn't born in Boston
I don't see Yanni.
He couldn't have gone far.
Why don't we go home early?
Yanni can't make Skura talk
Yanni!
Oh, my God!
It's dad!
Why don't we sit outside?
Let's fix the windshield
Push it down a little more.
How much time has elapsed?
Tom had Mary's keys
Why don't we clean this up?
Don't touch the windshield
Don't touch the windshield.
I'm not.
Why are ducks called ducks?
I've got everything

It's still visible
Yanni, of course!
Why don't we leave it here?
Why don't we go get it?

Why don't we do it?
What'll Tom do to us?
Is the resin dry?
Has the resin cured?
You're beautiful, Skura

Can you fix my windshield?
Toki Pona is my one-note samba
Yanni's bath mixer is broken

What did Tom do with it?
Why don't we wait?
The walls are breathing.
Yep, that's mushrooms for you.
What'll we give Tom?
Why don't we play it by ear?
Something's up

Why don't we meet after work?
Why don't we sit on the deck?

All the same, it's very rare
We'll have to wait a bit
Have you seen Tom?
I have – five minutes ago.
What's Tom doing with it?
It's an hour away by bus
In short: life is short
May Toki Pona remain simple!

Quarter to one.
I'll treat you to lunch
You must be hungry.
Tom's an old fart
What's Tom's answer?
Why don't we forget it?
I was just playing!
Why don't we keep it?
We can't see Tom
Why don't we just go home?
Look, eat, listen, learn
Can we get back to the topic?
Are they heartless?
What does Tom want now?
Well, what shall we do today!
Why don't we do it tonight?
Why don't you do it?
Why don't you do it instead?
Why don't we sit in the back?
Do you want some?
Yes, I do!
Why don't we do it together?
We don't have any toilet paper
Have you seen my brother?
There's no known antidote
What does Tom want to be?
Why don't we just eat here?
That game isn't in stock
Girls can play soccer, too
What size shirt does Tom wear?
Why don't we rent a rowboat?
Why don't we try?
I'm glad that Tom helped me
I'm glad that Tom was there
We didn't run

Did you say something?
Do you want to have my baby?
Why did you leave silently?
She's a wild one right now
It'd be better to avoid her
Hey, Tom" "Mary?
Understood.
Tom, he can't laugh at all
Have you had your meal yet?
Don't worry
I won't tell anyone a thing
Bye, see you tomorrow!

It's three hours away by bus
We'll put up spotlights
That wasn't a total surprise
It wasn't a complete surprise
Tom isn't bad at drawing

You have no self-confidence
You have no self-esteem
The door didn't shut
What do you mean?
Yanni, too, left the car
Yanni didn't look back
Yanni turned fourteen in 2004
We're worried about you, Tom
We worry about you, Tom

Tom!
Mary has come!
Since when have you been here?

Yanni is dating Skura's mom

I don't really know
Don't ask me
I really don't know
We didn't hear what Tom said
We didn't hear Tom come in
We didn't hear Tom leave
We didn't hear Tom
What have you seen so far?
It's Tom who will lose
Tom is a jack-of-all-trades
I was looking at Skura's dog
He was looking at Skura's dog
She was looking at Skura's dog
We were looking at Skura's dog
He's going back to school
She's going back to school
We're going back to school
They're going back to school
He doesn't know that
She doesn't know that
Skura and Nuja don't know that

Is Yanni home?
The engine wouldn't even start
Yanni sat on his car's trunk
Yanni's car is a piece of crap

Tom, I'm going to have a baby!
They can't go today
If you can, open that window
It's now open to the public
We didn't stop Tom
We can't let Mary die
I think they'll come back
They told me I couldn't
That's why I did
They're not natural curls!
We're still renegades
She's of average height
I've just given you a teaspoon
That was incredible!
We've fired Tom
Don't lie to yourselves
She didn't like everything
Does the room have a shower?
Is there a shower in the room?
Must Mary stay at home today?

I don't think Tom is a lawyer
We've missed Tom
We've just seen Tom
We're losing the battle
We can't fool Tom
It's due to open in October
The closet door was half-open

We weren't with Tom
Do you still play the tuba?
Do you speak French?
Not as well as I'd like to.
Are you here on vacation?

That's still open for debate
This isn't open for discussion
I'm losing money
We miss you, Tom
What were you doing to Tom?
Do you get paid well?
We're following Tom
Where have you been so far?
We'll support Tom
Is anyone sitting here?
Why don't we have a look?
We don't hate Tom
What motivated Tom to do that?
We'll thank Tom
We can't fire Tom
We've already told Tom
We know you're Tom
That's not so bad, is it?
Tom was in preschool in 2013
That's not very hard to do
That's not for you to say
That isn't my baseball bat
That's not Tom's voice
That isn't what I meant
I'm sorry
That's not what I asked
That's not recommended
That's not a smart thing to do
Tom didn't do what he was told
It wasn't Tom who told me that
That isn't really my name
Tom seemed surprised, too
That isn't a bad thing
Tom is a smart boy, to be sure
We didn't find the bomb
That isn't strictly true
That isn't very wise
Tom wasn't happy here
Tom didn't run after Mary
That isn't totally true
That isn't relevant
That isn't going to be fun
Tom didn't get it at all
That isn't how I feel
We haven't told Tom
We're impressed, Tom
That isn't worth the risk
Tom wasn't wearing his gloves
Tom didn't eat his sandwich
That isn't allowed here
That isn't reasonable
That isn't believable
That's not my son
Tom didn't say hi to Mary
That's not important to Tom
That isn't your cup
That isn't how it was
That isn't what Tom wanted
That isn't even the worst part
That isn't on my schedule
That's not a terrible thing
That isn't what I want to buy
That isn't your fault
That isn't easy to do
That isn't why I did it
That's not easy, you know
We need to get one, too
That isn't my decision to make
That isn't really good enough
That isn't the point at all
That isn't my real name
That isn't surprising nowadays
That isn't very convincing
That isn't how it works
Tom didn't love me
That isn't how it looked to me
That isn't important, is it?
That isn't under discussion
That isn't a good combination
That's not a new idea
That's not what I intended
That isn't me
That isn't how we did that
That isn't clear
That isn't rational
That's not on the list
Tom didn't even offer to help
That's not of much use
Is Tom OK with this?
That isn't my signature
That's not on the schedule
That isn't a real word
That isn't all that Tom did
That isn't surprising
That isn't exactly romantic
Tom didn't come here yesterday
That isn't scary
That's not Tom's only problem
That's not wine
It's grape juice
That's not exactly romantic
Tom didn't invite Mary
That's not Tom
It's his brother
That isn't very nice
Tom seemed very laid-back
That isn't what I'm afraid of
Tom wasn't sitting by himself
That isn't at all clear
That isn't my opinion
That isn't what I need to do
That isn't for you to decide
Tom didn't know me
That's not convenient for me
Tom hasn't changed a thing
Tom didn't want to come in
That isn't where I want to go
That's not new
That's not my knife
That isn't so good
That isn't much of an excuse
That isn't such a bad idea
Tom is a classmate of Mary's
Tom didn't feel appreciated
That isn't an illusion
That isn't entirely wrong
That isn't my intention
Tom was still a baby in 2013
That isn't the real reason
Tom isn't in my French class
That isn't very far, is it?
Tom didn't tell us why
That's not the best answer
That isn't how it went
That isn't very good, is it?
That isn't what we want to see
That isn't why I came here
This isn't what we paid to see
Tom didn't finish his drink
That isn't all I wanted
That isn't the end of it
I'll try this afternoon
What is this disgusting thing?
It's a spider
That's all.
That's totally unreasonable
You'll never catch me!
No one's forcing you to leave
No one's chasing you away
It's a well-deserved victory
Did she ask you any questions?
My favorite number is 4
She enjoyed Tom's presence
I'm old, but I feel young now
So much for fucking democracy!
A crocodile ate Tom.
A man-eating crocodile?
He's Greek
I'll never believe in that
I'm from Atlas
I'm from Ifrane
Aren't you coming tomorrow?
Why is Jupiter so beautiful?
Happy May Day!
Shh!
He's coming!
Shh!
She's coming!
I don't know; I'm just a cat
I'm not sure of the name
I'm not sure what his name is
Tom doesn't laugh at all
What's Tom doing tomorrow?
Why's everybody so uptight?
It's not easy being popular
Can we replace the upholstery?
It's not easy being a star
I don't think this way
That isn't part of the deal
He scored a hat-trick
That isn't entirely true
You can't live on hope alone
Hey!
Don't say such bad things.
Should I go to buy some bread?
That isn't necessary at all
Qur'an chanting is pretty
They'll spoil the child
That isn't your hat, is it?
What good was it?
What good are you?
Who disconnected the router?
That isn't what I was saying
Tom was mad, of course
That isn't your decision
That isn't a real problem
Tom didn't find us
That isn't very easy to do
That isn't your problem
You're from Australia, right?
Do you have any vegemite?
That isn't how I remember it
That isn't any fun
That's not a mistake
Kaname is a girls' name
That isn't the goal
Tom!
That isn't a fair question
Was Tom OK with that?
That isn't possible right now
That isn't up to you
Tom's blood pressure is high
Tom's got high blood pressure
He's in good shape
That isn't an issue anymore
That jumper's got long arms
That isn't why we work
Does she have a house?
Where were you yesterday?
You weren't at home
Tom came home at 6.30
Tom arrived home at 6.30
That isn't what I just heard
You're doing the best you can
It's a very contagious disease
You don't take sugar?
Why do you think I'm rich?
Tom doesn't like summer
We're all going to do that
Tom could've fixed it
Your son isn't like you
We're not like Tom and Mary
That isn't going to work
I hope you're doing your best
I didn't see that happen
That isn't a bug
It's a feature
That isn't a word
That isn't a problem at all
Tom didn't see what Mary did
That isn't on the schedule
That isn't really true, though
That isn't the tool I'd use
That isn't interesting
Tom is a little old-fashioned
Tom didn't read the letter
We're all sick
That's not a cat
Yeah.
Aren't you late?
What were you doing?
That's not the plan right now
Tom isn't going alone
Tom didn't get in trouble
That isn't my experience
That's a pity, I don't care
That isn't a cat
It's a dog
I'm overwhelmed by his glory
You're broke I can't relate
That isn't true anymore
That's not my idea
Tom didn't trust me
Your son doesn't look like you
I'm not a translator
We're not translators
I'm not an interpreter
We're not interpreters
I could've been a translator
I could've been an interpreter
That isn't the only reason
Tom said he didn't really care
That's not smart
Where are you wandering?
That isn't a bad thought
That isn't so hard
It's a lopsided conflict
Did you truly love me?
Tom hasn't yet paid me
That isn't our job
That isn't my decision
No cheating!
Play fair!
Dad, I need boxing gloves

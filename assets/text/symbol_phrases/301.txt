What made Tom do such a thing?
How many days did Tom do that?
I've done a lot of skating
I've done a lot of surfing
I've drunk too much coffee
Tom won't give Mary money
I've been busy for three days
I've been here for a week
I've lived here since 2013
My guess is that it'll rain
That book isn't mine
I'm the tallest
There's no water here

There's no reason not to
Must we wait for her here?
Can you guess his age?
But the coffee isn't tasty
Are you friends?
People can't keep quiet
We saw Tom's dance
My French class is at 2:30
What does Tom want to achieve?
My house was built in 2013
Did Tom offer to help Mary?
Now's my chance to do that
Are the two of you friends?
I wish you'd be more positive
I don't want to do that to Tom
We can't afford to do that
I've been called for jury duty
What is an endurance test?
I don't know her age
I don't know his age
Who invented the safety pin?
I amn't going to do that
You're washing laundry for me
You're doing laundry for me
You're washing my laundry
You're doing my laundry

Tom and Mary are, too
Tom doesn't like to complain
So you speak English fluently?
I'm really hung over
I don't complain but I could
People didn't like Tom
That's a very good thing
Now it's my turn to speak
I'd be happy to.
I've had fun talking with you
The danger wasn't apparent
You'd better do it at once
It wasn't easy to find gold
There's nothing to cancel
Is this my textbook or yours?
I've eaten all of them
I've eaten them all
Will you go out with Tom?
What took you so long, Tom?
Tom couldn't accept his defeat
Tom won't stop smoking
How did Tom hurt you?
I didn't buy it for Tom
I haven't seen her here since
Is Tom really a vegan?
Don't make fun of me, Tom
Tom hasn't answered me yet
I'm not indispensable
Are you playing croquet?
That's a yikes from me, sweaty
Let's go and help him
How did you manage that?
Magic.
When'll Tom be ready?
That could've been done
It could've been done
She hasn't slept all night
She didn't suffer much?
Private Petrov!
You're too slow
Ten push-ups!
Maria doesn't like parsley
What's your name?
Tom.
This isn't very important
What will you eat today?
I cough when I'm nervous
That's what makes you happy?
I'm just doing it for the food
Oh my Gosh!
You know what his problem is?
All right, I'll do my best
OK, I'll do my best
The train's about to arrive
Which one should I order?
Just go with that one.
Don't you feel uncomfortable?
Why do you drink that shit?
Who's going with you tomorrow?
Where is she from, again?
Why don't you eat anything?
Why won't you eat anything?
She's allergic to flowers
My crush is allergic to cats.
But aren't you a cat?
That's why she rejected me.
Who wanted to talk with me?
When did this start?
It's always good to have hope
What happened to the server?
I'll do it today
It's good to talk with friends
Swedish.
Something's happening there
Something's going on there
How'd you learn that trick?
I'll be right back
You shouldn't tease dogs
I'm seriously wounded
Now we're getting serious
I love your outfit!
You inspired me.
Let's be objective
Do you know the words?
No, the seats weren't leather
I'm your best friend
It's bedtime
It's bedtime
It's his day off today
Where did my newspapers go?
Let's hope it's a good omen
How many presents did you get?
It's teeming down here
It's pouring with rain here
He's never on time
She's trustworthy
What is the time?
Four-ish.
Don't squish Cookie's beans!
Hey, King!
Yeah, what?
Look at my shrink ray.
Oh!
What's this shit?
Shrink ray.
Shrink ray?
Test it on your dick, my boy
Ha ha!
Of course!
I'm trying to—oops!
You are my prisoner.
What'd you mean?
I shall keep you in my prison.
What the hell?
Silence!
Tom stole the ogre's boots
Father, Link said you suck.
Of course not, king.
(The king sucks
The king sucks.)
Please, have m—ah!
Could I ask you for a favor?
Do frogs have teeth?
It's a Great Dane
It doesn't look symmetrical
If we stay here, we'll be seen
Do you know where Tom died?
At least, stay till morning
When are you coming?
Why was Tom punished?
He didn't do anything serious
Tom won't help you anymore
Let's take care of this wound
What's Facebook?
Do you know when Tom died?
The world is unfair, isn't it?
What happened?
I'm reading your thoughts
Most people don't like losing
I know what you're thinking
I'm reading your thoughts.
What am I thinking?
This isn't Kira
It's me
I'm not Kira.
You have a sharp mind.
Why did no one support me?
Great!
Can I come too?
Enough, let's go
Squadala, we're off!" "...Huh?
Squadala!.
Squadala, we're not off!
What happened?
Your Majesty is too fat.
Fuck you, I'm going by ship.
Wanna hear a song?
You've got to be kidding.
Hey!
What about me?
My cakes are awful!
I think you're gay already
Try feeling your dick.
Did Tom go to see Mary?
Tom told us to wait until 2:30

What would you say to them?
Count to ten, everyone
Where were you born?
Can someone else run it?
Indeed!
Indeed!
You could've helped me
Where's there a hole?
There!
Oh, no one'll see that.
End of!
What's Tom's father's name?
How should I know?
I thought you'd know.
Well, you thought wrong
Sorry.
Have you found those books?
They could be anywhere.
Where did you learn to swim?
Is there garlic in this?
No, Nan.
But I can smell garlic in it!
You know I don't eat that!
Just try it at least.
No!
I'm going to the Millers'
They'll be eating about now
Empty the waste-paper bin
It's overflowing
Where shall we sit?
Well, no one
I hear you're from Canada
I'm from Alaska.
Oh!
It's always the same old story
Tom's going to abstain
Why did you lot abstain?
Why did you abstain?
Parting wasn't easy for them
Parting wasn't easy for her
Who is listening?
Who is singing?
Hey, Handsome
Is this the bus for Boston?
Is there room for my luggage?
At last, we arrived in Boston
Tomorrow I'll harvest grapes
That's of no value to us
I can't afford to buy this car
I'm getting what I wanted
I'm sorry for earlier
Free Britney!
All those guys are butt-ugly
I'm handsome!
We needn't talk about that
We don't have to talk about it
It's not that important
He hasn't noticed yet
It's a matter of habit
The conclusion was easy: 1
05–28 40–45 2
28–50 ..
If it breaks, that's alright
If it breaks, it's no big deal
Do you have any cheese?
Do you want a shirt?
Yes, I want a red one.
Let's start the week off well
I won't make it easier for Tom
What did Tom participate in?
Will Tom be executed?
Do you know Santali language?
Tom didn't come home from work
Can you speak in Santali?
I'm studying in Santali School
25 x 3
We'll be damned
Let's make sure he's all right
Drink responsibly!
No.
Uh... what do I do now?
Did you have lunch?
In my dreams, I can fly
It's not the right one for you
Would you like a bagel?
I'd love a bagel.
Why can't you explain ?
Why can't you explain?
There's nothing above us
Don't you ever go there?
Do you never go there?
John doesn't smoke any more
Give your mother my best!
It's a postmodern coup
We're going in
Will Tom have to wait for it?
How old is the son of Mary?
What has he been doing?
I'll get it for you
Having talent isn't enough
Can we change the font?
I'll just be a second
How much will all that cost?
Who's in charge of that?
We're short of workers now
They thus scored 40 points
Black won by 1 point
That is right!
This is rare, but it happens
This isn't the time for joking
This isn't the time for jokes
It's easy to make
Why did my coach demote me?
Do you like exploring me?
How did you make it?
Do you still want to marry me?
I haven't forgotten her!
I care a lot for him!
Tell me the truth!
Let's act!
Please visit us, your honor!
You don't need to be ashamed
Don't wake her up!
May you be healthy!
I won't capture him again
You will certainly regret it!
He's obviously right
Let's go somewhere fun
Let's go somewhere fun!
Try it today!
It's not good for them
We're always hopeful
Why not invite him?
Why not invite her?
Why don't you invite him?
Why don't you invite her?
Come again in three days!
If I can do it, anyone can
If Tom can do it, anyone can
They won't accept the truth
I called it!
My mother-in-law is visiting
Don't worry
I don't want you here
Could you help me?
Unfortunately, I don't know
I wish you the best of luck!
What a strange ceremony!
What a strange ritual!
They're all slackers
They're all lazy bums
Go to school, lazybones!
What makes you so indignant?
That's not what exasperates me
Is he old or young?
This is an old tub, not a car
Shall I send it to you?
I'll write to you immediately
You still didn't do it?
As well he should be!
Can we start now?
Let's not live
You'll miss me when I'm gone
I don't take myself seriously
Why is the door unlocked?
Guys, take a look over here
How do I get to the theater?
Do you go to an academy?
Did they cut my line?
I think they're not from here
I'm really insecure
Where's my backpack?
Are you sure you're OK?
She learns fast!
Do we have class today?
Do you think I'm extroverted?
What now, my friend?
Do you really need to see me?
Talking doesn't cost anything
I think I'll stop for a bit
The exam wasn't hard
I promise I won't laugh at you
Can't you look away?
Tom didn't want to do it
In the end, he had to
The interview began at 2:30
It was close to three o'clock
You're not immune to the virus
I'm not immune to flattery
Tom didn't go to the polls
Are you Irish?
That's an exaggeration
That's a tall tale
Do we have school today?
Don't give Tom my car
Don't be ridiculous
Tom lives in Boston.
Could you fill this out?
I'm getting fed up
I'm getting sick of it
It's an exaggeration
I'm a fan of classical music
Remove the camera now!
It's not possible without help
Tell me why that's important
Would you like a bit more?
You needn't go there today
Might you have overlooked it?
There weren't any more stops
Stunning!
He thinks he's important
Tom's gay, isn't he?
I don't have a dictionary
Say that again!
You've got to talk to Ziri
Have you seen my diary?
Why don't you ask Ziri?
Why don't you ask Dad?
Have you seen my cookbook?
I'm dumping you
Call me Mr. Ziri
Have you brought your camera?
Of course I remember it!
Ziri is here.
What's your name?
Tom.
What's the whole name?
My name is Tom, just Tom.
Would you like some music?
Is there someone in your life?
Is Tom a famous actor?
Do you like parsley?
Is Tom a great actor?
Tom's a great actor, isn't he?
Don't get too attached to Ziri
You're entirely correct
You spied on us?
You're going to get a bonus
Will you be here?
When?
When I pass away.
No, Ziri, you're not dying!
I know the history of Kabylia!
That's a personal decision
Do I snore a lot when I sleep?
Do I snore a lot?
That's Tom's personal decision
Help me open this, please
We're doing God's work here
It's really late
I'm having beer
I don't have an accent
Tom's car needs washing
Do you find me extroverted?

Would you do me a big favour?
What is it?
I wish you'd told me sooner
Would you do me a big favor?
What is it?
I want some more.
Don't buy things you won't use
Would you do me a big favor?
Why are you here?
Me too.
Oh, so this is Tom's doing.
That's an uncommon enough name
Is that really Tom's job?
That's not a very common name
That's not an uncommon name
It's a very common name
That's not what I meant.
Tom's clothes are very stylish
Are you thirsty, Tom?
Do you have internet at home?
It's very flammable
It's not a cape, it's a coat
Charles nicked it!
It's all her fault
It's all their fault
I said "fair fish in the sea.
In the end, it wasn't so bad
I met the new teacher.
What's she like?
It's too hot today
Why do you need Tom here?
Can you pick me up at 3?
What's wrong with my face?
Did Tom bother you again?
What are you doing here?
Tom's got connections
Tom, I've got a crisis here
I'm exhausted from today
They still do it, don't they?
Oh, awesome
I'll try to pay more attention
I'm exhausted today
Can you pick me up at three?
I won't harm you
What did you promise you'd do?
At your age, I'd think so, too
There's a shopping area nearby
Could you speak more slowly?
Why should we follow you?
Please don't walk out on me
I don't believe your story
Tom is pretty forward-thinking
Will this serum cure COVID?
You won't last long here
You won't last long
You'll eat what we give you
Why do you hate girls?
Who doesn't like a good movie?
Where's your next class?
We would've liked that
We won't see each other again
We'll eat whatever there is
Is this even edible?
When is your last class over?
Tom's parents like me
Do we have enough ice?
Tom must've done it on purpose
How about I don't?
I don't want pizza for dinner
Maybe I won't do that
That doesn't worry me
I'm not going back there
I'm not doing well today
I still haven't met Tom
I still don't know Tom
Let's hurry
I don't want to miss the train
Have you left work yet?
Come pick me up around 2:30
What did they ask you about?
That's a good place to live
We should've waited for Tom
We should've stayed longer
We should've offered to help
We should've been quieter
It'll grow old
I believe that's my seat
Tell me that isn't so
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that isn't true
Everything's still new to me
Can I have some more wine?
Do you know where my purse is?
Can I have ketchup, please?
It's on the house
I don't drink with my dinner
Is Mary a famous actress?
Isn't Mary a famous actress?
Have you been helped?
Mary is more than just "cute
She's a stunner
Don't worry about it
I appreciate the effort.
It's already up
For real?
It's a spear
How did you twist your ankle?
I've lost my fountain pen
How's Tom liking Boston?
He's as dumb as ever
He's as silly as usual
He's as foolish as always
We've had a whale of a time
So, who came?
Has he stopped smoking?
Was that a big moment for you?
We'll see.
So you'd rather not?
When's it going to stop?
Tom's got two sons
Who's visiting us?
You shouldn't stay up too late
This is how it's always been
We'd manage with their help
Who shall we pick?
I'll expose you!
Is there some secret plan?
This was my idea, not Tom's
Everyone broke out?!
That's ridiculous!
Is that correct information?
Is that information correct?
Tom didn't even acknowledge me
I don't like quality
The cat's out of the bag!
Tomorrow I'll pick grapes
That's completely useless
We beat them 4 to 5
We don't have much rice left
Who'll keep an eye on things?
The bill was $300
That's actually what I wanted
Let's never speak of it again
Basically, it's the same thing
There's something I must know
You'd better watch your mouth
My village's name is "Polperro
My country's name is "Russia
Tom's watch was stolen
Tom's room was unlocked
Is the car ready?
It doesn't look expensive
There's nothing in my wallet
It's one o'clock sharp
She's always punctual
I'm Tom
I've never met her before
What scared you, silly?
What frightened you, silly?
What are you scared of, silly?
Hey, Tom
What colour is silica?

That's the gist of it, I think

It's all dark here
It's finally spring
Where's the remote control?
What is sadness?
The cars were sold dirt-cheap
When did I lie?
I'm a militant
Are you Jackie Scott?
It's not in your interest
How about a glass of milk?
I'm not used to the work
I'm not used to the job
I'm still not used to the job
What are you ordering?
I shouldn't have rushed
I should've taken my time
The meeting's over
Face the camera, please
How come Tom hasn't come?
Of course, I'll help you
Where will the funeral be?
When will the funeral be?
Could we come visit you today?
What are you going to eat now?
The truth is that I don't care
What's causing this rash?
There's no need to call anyone
They only do what they're told
I don't know how far I walked
There's no need to hurry
I'm starting to hate this job
Tom hasn't been here in ages
That's an absolute lie
You shouldn't wear a fur coat
It's more than doubled in size
It'll never happen again
That's my mom's computer
There's wax on the carpet
It'll be hard to find the time
There's no plane on the runway
This wasn't the only problem
You've been good soldiers
I'd vote for Tom if I could
Why does Tom need to be here?
Is Tom bothering you again?
What're you doing here?
You're supposed to be with Tom
Tom must've forgotten about us
I didn't buy it for Tom
Tom stole Mary's shoes
Tom isn't home from work yet
Tom doesn't trust Tom
Tom can't stand Tom
Do you understand me?
It's time we went to bed
Have you any idea?
Have you any idea about it?
It's my turn to talk now!
Play fast, lose fast
You can't order me around!
Is this praise or ridicule?
It's an insignificant problem
What impudence!
I will make a complaint!
Such insolence!
I will lodge a complaint!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What a throw!
What a throw!
He's not a poet
You're driving too fast
Do you have a needle?
No, not really.
Does nothing alarm you?
I'm scared
That's easy to understand
You're exhausting me
I can't stand dirty jokes
You speak Japanese so well!
Tom is such a pain!
Can't he leave me alone?
You've informed me
You're Portuguese, right?
He doesn't drink or smoke
Why don't you support them?
She's disgruntled with her job
Good people don't lose
He's going to the store
I don't deserve to hear this
He's as bright as his friend
I'm not a cat
I'm a fox
She's studying Dutch
Why did I have to come here?
Excuse me, gentlemen
There's someone at the door
This is an outrage!
That Mary is impossible!
You called, Your Majesty?
So you didn't get jealous?
Why don't we have a smoke?
Can't
I just quit.
I didn't want to talk with him
I'm busy
I can't stand guys like that
Sorry, but who are you?
He's my true love
Who could teach me French?
How should I say this?
She's really nice with me
We don't have to worry
It's still too early to say
I'm bored with this topic
Tom's speech was boring
It's easy to gain Tom's trust
Why would I tell you that?
Can I be leader now?
Yeah, that's our new CEO.
Oh, of course!
I should've known.
Well, I couldn't find it..
That's why I like Interlingua!
I don't want anybody to know
Are you satisfied with Tom?
No, we aren't
He is a bad worker.
What kind of pain do you have?
What kind of ring do you want?
What kind of boat do you have?
What kind of dog should I get?
What kind of tent do you have?
What kind of student are you?
What kind of manager are you?
What kind of boss are you?
She's my true love
I'll run away
You won't escape from Tom
Tom won't let me be
Tom wouldn't believe me anyway
Tom isn't my cousin
Respect Tom's privacy, please
Surely this won't work at all
She's just started her lunch
I'm an anarchist
I can't sleep on planes
Mary wore high-waisted jeans
Mary wore low-rise jeans
Mary wore low-waisted jeans
I'll do it after Tom leaves
Is Istanbul beautiful?
Don't be scared
When did I die?
Did you get sleepy?
He's the boss here
I'm going to write a novel
Is the book yours?
Well, I have a suggestion
Who can count the stars?
It's you who must give up
You know what you're missing?
I'm sure I'm going to miss him
What's he been doing?
How old is Tom's son?
She's not my girlfriend
Do I snore?
How about I don't do that?
It isn't that important
Tom doesn't like parsley
Why don't you eat something?
Something's going on in there
What is age of retirement?
How did you learn that trick?
Wow, pretty ring!
Wow, what a pretty ring!
Well, it is mutual
We'll go this way
It's misty here
Don't get lost in the fog
Can you withstand it?
Do you still remember?
It's a snail
That's what Tom says, anyway
Why is your tongue blue?
No, I'm not.
Slainte!
L'chaim!
This watch isn't quite right
That clock isn't quite right
This clock's not quite right
It's really getting colder
Ha!
Nice try.
Is the washing-up done?
Three hours, I'd say
Go for a walk.
I'm a person of little means
Wait outside, please
Are these two cases linked?
Your car really needs it.
Doesn't matter!
A wasp does not give honey!
Pretend you're doing something
Don't neglect it
Who told you to tell Tom?
You can't say that to Tom!
Is it true?
Do you ever go there?
Who wanted to talk to me?
I can't find my comb
Are cats capable of magic?
I don't work for money
I beat my PR by 13 seconds
How much is his car worth?
What were you trying to say?
What's your cousin doing here?
Are you going to eat or what?
The teacher isn't here yet
We're computer scientists
I didn't understand
Could you repeat that?
Tom can't hold his liquor
Jeez, you learn fast
Don't put me in a straitjacket
I'm not crazy
What a beautiful poem!
Did you write this?
When do your classes start?
Is there any bread left?
Do we have any more bread?
Is that really happening?
I've never been to this beach
Man, this is awesome!
Thanks a lot!
Is gas really that expensive?
Hi!
Jeez!
Dude, that's too expensive!
Get the free app!
I love linguistics!
Are you good at calligraphy?
I'm learning kurdish
Mary's heart aches with regret
Is this your hobby?
You've already eaten!
The plan isn't workable
How is this plan?
Is that what makes you happy?
Black won 20 to 16
Is another world possible?
Shall we go to a movie today?
I don't go out if it snows
If it snows, I don't go out
I won't go out if it snows
If it snows, I won't go out
Let's hope Charlie is right
That's how we communicate
Over here, ma'am
I wouldn't be so optimistic
I'm not so optimistic
Do you take us for idiots?
Why can't I find you?
Anyone can be a legend.
What will you name the baby?
It's pouring down rain here
There's no reason to shout
There's a lot of food left
There's no truth to the rumor
There's much more to be done
There's no water in the stream
What's this scar from?
I don't want to talk about it.
I bet it'll rain tomorrow
If it snows, I'll stay home
If it snows, I'll stay inside
Tom isn't my cousin
He's my stepbrother
When did you buy this canoe?
Bats have wings, too
I'll come over soon
I'm sorry
I don't know how to do that
We didn't count the bodies
He's a real force of nature
Don't be scared of me
If I can do this, so can you
I don't remember what you said
I won't reveal my decision now
He can't do anything but talk
For many, it's weakness
And for others, calculation
That's why we argue so much
I'd like you to do it yourself
Let's buy a new refrigerator
I'm sorry that I made you wait
I'm sorry you had to wait
I'm learning Uyghur
How long has she been gone?
I'm happy you're still here
Why did you take what's ours?
It'll be cold next week
It's rude
This novel is fabulous!
There's nothing left there
I'll follow her advice
Buy two, get one free
It's the worst we've ever had
They're sad
That's not a cricket
It's a grasshopper
You're way off the mark
You were right about that, Tom
Tom called me a communist.
So what?
You are one.
You're drunk
You're staying over
Why do people burp?
What causes people to burp?
It wasn't me who just burped
I'm allergic to stupidity
That's impolite
Are you really from Boston?
You're a Canadian, right?
It's been getting colder
It's really getting cold
I'll follow Tom's advice
Is it cold where you're going?
I don't drink every evening
So, did you get kissed?
Where can I buy a parachute?
Where can I buy a wheelbarrow?
How many cows do you own?
Where did you put the ladder?
He didn't stint his praise
There's no point in hoping
Take it for what it's worth
Is the minimum wage taxable?
Will he admit it?
It's pretty, isn't it?
How was your day, daddy?
That's an interesting plan
You've got big ears, Tom
Hey, can I rub them?
Stop it!
They look tasty.
Tom, are you hungry?
What a beautiful melody!
I wrote a new book. ♀
I wrote a new book. ♂
May I borrow your rake?
God isn't real
This bread isn't expired?
We don't want a war
I can't wait
I feel like I'm dying
I can't, either
Tom's pulse came back
There's no substitute for this
Does that bolt seem loose?
They're with us
Hopefully, Tom won't get mad
If you're so sleepy, go to bed
Is that a toad or a frog?
What beautiful legs!
Why did you open the window?
It's cold
It's cold
Why are all the windows open?
You'd better not go back there
Is that everything now?
I didn't find the bread cake
I didn't find the pancake
I'm trying to eat fast
Do you sing to your cat?
How beautiful this morning is!
What a beautiful evening!
Mary wasn't ready

I'm not good at tennis
I can't wait to die
I want to hear Tom's voice
I'd like to sing a song
I'd like a glass of wine
I'd like to climb Mt
I've read hundreds of books
Are we really in 2015?
The train is leaving!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
I've got to get on this train
How did she know my name?
Excuse me, where is the beach?
Did it work?
I don't sleep much
What date is today?
Where does she leave?
What is your password?
When is the breakfast served?
The fan doesn't work
The pillow isn't clean
Can I leave my luggage here?
Can I have my keys?
Can you get my bill ready?
Do you need a deposit?
I'm gonna tell you the truth
I'll give it to you for free
Don't interrupt me!
I've never seen him laugh

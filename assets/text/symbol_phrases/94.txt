You can't eat chicken?
Check in, please
Can I check in now?
I'd like to check in, please
When is checkout time?
I'd like to check out
I'd like to check out
Do you have my bill?
I'd like to check out
Could you call the bellboy?
Cheese doesn't digest easily
Which way is the cheese shelf?
I'd like some cheese
How is cheerleading practice?
Where are the tampons?
It's getting colder and colder
Do you like dancing?
What a pity you can't dance!
Taro, go and brush your teeth
Whose go is it?
Who were you talking with?
Not everyone can be a KRS-ONE
Who invented the telephone?
Who left the window open?
Who has taken my handbag?
Everest first?
Somebody's at the porch!
Who cares?
Who cared?
Who is in fault?
Who can put a bell on the cat?
Who looks after the children?
Who is behind the plot?
Who painted these pictures?
Who wrote this book?
Who made the doll?
Who made this plan?
Who teaches you French?
Can somebody get that?
Who taught you how to dance?
No, don't go yet
No!
Let's dine out for a change
They'll probably come by car
It's going to rain
I should say he won't come
I've reserved a double
I'd like a double room
I'd like a double with a bath
Double, please
You're tough
Why don't you give up smoking?
Smoking's not permitted here
Don't you smoke?
Would you mind not smoking?
Do you mind my smoking?
Do you mind if I smoke?
I don't mind if you smoke
Would you mind if I smoke?
You'd better give up smoking
I don't smoke
Would you mind if I smoked?
If he fails, so what?
Even if it rains, I'll start
How many samples, for example?
I've just finished my work
I've just come back
No more than 50 people came
It only costs $10.00!
It's just a trick of the wind
However, you have to queue..
We're out of stock now
I'm home, Mom!
I think it's worth asking
It's faster to reserve a taxi
Let's get out of the taxi
I'll call you a taxi
Let's take a taxi
Why don't we take a taxi?
Shall we take a taxi?
Let's go by taxi, shall we?
You are wrong, however
So we'd better stay home
So fuckin' what
So what?
It doesn't matter to me
So, it isn't hot at all
How about Thai food?
Can I dial directly?
The hardness of diamond is 10
Do you have Time magazine?
I'll punch the clock
It was a very, very hot night
Can I use your typewriter?
You can type, can't you?
You're about right
About how much will it cost?
About how long will it take?
It's about 8 kilometers away
It's almost six o'clock
We didn't have much trouble
We didn't have much fun
That doesn't matter
Hotshot!
It isn't much of a car
I'd like a daiquiri
How's your diet kick?
Why don't you go on a diet?
The tar won't come off
Don't tell me off like that
Let's not think like that
That's how I came to know her
Don't talk like that
Don't give me such a sad look
That's impossible
Don't ask such hard questions
I'll fix it so it doesn't hurt
Don't talk so loud
I've never seen so big a dog
Please don't walk so fast
I can't keep pace with you
I can't imagine such a life
Don't go out of your way
Oh, don't worry about that
You know I can't
Don't be too hard on me
You can't believe a word of it
Don't put it that way
I don't feel like it
I don't want to take risks
Don't make such a mistake
I don't give a damn about it!
It can't be right
That's a piece of pie
You knew it wouldn't
Don't worry about that
That's just an excuse
That's for suckers
Don't be so angry
You mustn't stay out that late
You don't have to cry out
Don't walk so fast
Don't speak so fast, please
Don't walk so fast!
I can't keep up with you
Don't run so fast
Don't speak so fast
Don't make so much noise
Don't make such a noise!
Please don't speak so fast
Don't walk so fast
I can't keep up with you
You're making the baby sick!
Don't eat so much
You'll get fat
Don't get so excited!
Don't push me very hard
It's dangerous
Don't hit me so hard
Don't shout like that
Don't be in such a hurry
Don't raise my hopes like that
It's not so far
It's folly to eat so much
You shouldn't smoke so much
Don't make such a sour face
Don't eat like a pig
Don't be such a hothead
There's no need to panic
There's plenty of time
I didn't mean it
Don't look so fiercely at me
That can't be true
Don't take it literally
That's easy for you to say
Don't say that
Don't give me that
Stop saying that!
Don't worry about such a thing
I don't like those who say so
How stupid of me to do so!
What is the good of doing it?
It's nonsense to try that
I'm sorry for what I did
That won't make any difference
That's a matter of course
I'll be hanged if it's true
I don't give a damn about it
What's the point?
I'll be damned if it's true
Do you think it likely?
Don't let that happen again!
It's as easy as pie
It's about time for dinner
It's about time we went back
It's almost time to go to bed
It's about time we went to bed
I'm afraid I have to go now
It's about time
Let's be going now
I'm taking off now
It's time you faced reality
We'd better go home now
Have you been here since?
I haven't seen her since then
Will you send it by mail?
Let's get it over with
I'm very sorry to hear that
I'm very glad to hear that
I'm sorry to hear that
I'm sorry to hear it
I'm so sorry to hear that
Don't blame it on her
May I try it on?
Let's make it brief
Can you prove it?
May I eat a little of it?
Get it, and put it on the fire
Buy it for me, please
Give it to me, please
It's no use worrying about it
There's nothing you can do
At that, he stood up
Don't hold it upside down
Can you make it on time?
Where did you get this?
Will you carry it out for me?
Don't expose it to the rain
What shall I do with it?
It's up to you to do it
If anyone can do it, Bill can
Let's finish it right away
May I do it right now?
It's not us who did it
Get them out of here!
Don't take that too literally
I bought it for 10 dollars
Isn't that theirs?
They aren't my books
What are they for?
What are they made of?
None, they are all outside
These figures don't add up
Show me the photos, please
I'd rather stay here
That's not a bad idea
It's about the size of an egg
That's very big of you
It's for a friend of mine
That's my sole concern
It's out of the question
Is it made of wood or metal?
It's free of charge
Can it really be mine?
That's really a great idea
It can't be true
Can it be true?
I think it's true
That's against the law
It was a one-sided love affair
It's a fact you can't deny
That's powdered medicine
That's hard to say
It's a very delicate question
It's a matter of cost
It's secret
What a shame!
It's an answer to her letter
It is hers, is it not?
Does it bark at her?
That's his specialty
It's white
I'm not going to sell it
Is it Japanese food?
That's a tall order
It isn't hard to do
It's neither good nor bad
It's not a road, but a path
That's beside the point
That's hindsight
That's common sense
Is it a direct flight?
You can't fix it
Is it a butterfly or a moth?
That's asking too much
It's merely a joke
Whose idea was it?
It's the same for everyone
That's quite a problem
It's an artificial flower
That's a layman's idea
It has cost me $100 altogether
That's 3000 yen altogether
I don't like it at all
That's quite absurd
That's quite another thing
That's absolute nonsense!
That's altogether wrong
That's quite to my taste
That's absolute nonsense
Leave that job to the experts!
That's not absolutely certain
It waited, silently
What exactly does that mean?
It's the front gate
It won't get anywhere
That's a doll
It isn't new
It's new
It's a delicate problem
That's an excellent wine
Is it baked?
That didn't help them any
That's news to me
Is it fine gold?
Is it yours?
It's a dictionary
It's a waste of time
It's a waste of time and money
That's not the case
That's my province
That's my affair
It's in my jacket pocket
That's my dictionary
It's for my personal use
It's for my family
Is it anything like mine?
It isn't mine
It's none of my business!
It's too difficult for me
It's all one to me
That's good news to me
It's me
That's what I said all along
I think it's the best way
It's an embarrassing question
Is it not black?
That's too expensive
It isn't expensive
That's putting it mildly
This isn't fair
Won't it keep until later?
That'll be a cold day in hell
That's your funeral
That won't help you
That's your responsibility
It's your stereotyping
Is it near your house?
You can't mistake it
It's a terrible affair
That's a copy
How did you like it?
It's a worrying matter
Is it sweet or sour?
I'll look forward to it
It's certainly a waste of time
Can I take your word for it?
That's stretching the point
What is the story?
What does it refer to?
What a beautiful vase it is!
What a long bridge it is!
What an easy problem it is!
What an animal it is!
Isn't that an English book?
That's an incredible story
It's the sound of secret minds
It is computed at 10,000 yen
How did it all come about?
I'm afraid you're mistaken
Wow!
That's cheap!
It's against the rules
Do you fancy it is all right?
I'm not sure about that
That's an old trick
I can't help it
It's worth a try
I think it's worth a try
It's already out of fashion
That's one level down
That's quite meaningless
It's all up to you
That doesn't regard you at all
It's not quite certain
It's entirely up to you
It's almost over
It is Pochi's food
It's a sunflower
That's terrible
That's very naughty of you
How long it is!
That's nonsense
What animal is it?
What kind of play is it?
Of what value is it?
It's a trifling incident
Which theater is that?
Which gate is that?
How long ago was that?
It's beyond me
Where is it hidden?
It's a TV
That's a delicate point
You're carrying this too far
It is too cruel, I should say
It's sort of strange
That's exactly what I want
That's just a yarn
That's quite a story
It's a hard, dirty job
It is quite an achievement!
That's a splendid idea
What time is it, anyway?
Gee, I wish I had that problem
That's a brilliant idea
It's a wonderful work of art
That's a great idea
He cried, "That's good!
That's a bright idea
It's a very slow business
You'd better not do it
That is no fault of Jack's
That's a cheerful remark
It's just another story
It's junk
That's too bad
It's a matter of etiquette
When does it begin?
What ever can that be?
I think it's a good idea
That'd be nice
It's a possible story
Is that a common name?
It is not very polite, either
It's not worth much
That's really sad
It begins at six-thirty
It's enough for five days
It will cost around 10,000 yen
That won't work
Does that price include tax?
It's the same to me
What is it?
It's my favorite food
We're going to pull it
Why don't we shake on it?
Let's shake on it
Does that include breakfast?
You mustn't touch it
I didn't notice it
What do you think about it?
How did you see that?
I paid 10 dollars for it
You should've said so earlier
What do you mean by it?
Well, what happened to her?
You've done more than enough
That's the last straw!
So what are you implying?
And what do you do?
Well, let's talk turkey
That's against the contract
Now let's hurry to school
That means sure death!
Well, I must be going
Uh, will you excuse me?
Does that mean you won't come?
People don't say that anymore
Is it like "Dirty Harry"?
How do you feel about it?
What'll they think of next?
No, that's all
Then, I'll be leaving you
Well then, I'll have chicken
I don't know if it is good
I'll be hanged if that's true
Let's ask if it's true
That's thieves' cant
That's all
Let's suppose it's true
That's what we want to know
It's my favorite song
That's the point
What has that to do with me?
It's the best score up to now
That's the way it is
Is that what you have in mind?
Is that your carry-on?
I don't know what it is
My name's not 'girl,' either
What did you do then?
Then I'd take the nickel out
Then, a shout was raised
That's exactly what he said
Is this Canadian money?
I don't care how much it costs
I'm going to buy it anyway
Are you making a pass at me?
What do you mean by that?
What does it mean?
It's not a little money
Well, you got a point there
Here's the bus
There!
She comes!
I'm surprised you came at all
Do you have any soft drinks?
It's on the sofa
May I lie on the sofa?
Don't come near me
I'm all ears
The story didn't sound true
The train departs at 7:15 a.m
How fast the train is running!
How fast the train runs!
Who planned that trip?
Does the medicine act quickly?
I've never heard of the actor
Let's talk over the matter
It's your responsibility
I'll reconsider the matter
Don't trifle with the matter
We won't take up the problem
I'll see to it
That gives me a headache!
Let's discuss the problem
What happens to all the wood?
Don't cut down those trees
Can you climb the tree?

Hand me that book, please
Did you order the book?
Where did you buy that book?
Are you through with the book?
Who was the book written by?
Have you done with the book?
Where is the book?
Was the book interesting?
The price of the book was $5

I couldn't speak well that day
That's a bad day for me

I don't like either of them
Don't touch that pan!
It's very hot
Let's try to solve the riddle

Isn't the answer easy?

The statue is dated 1920
The pond is 3 meters deep

Can the news be true?
Does that include everything?

The man, Oedipus, trembled
How is the word pronounced?

Is it large enough?

In that case, you are right
In that case, call the police

The castle dates back to 1610
That joke isn't funny
I didn't get the joke

Don't sit upon it

That novel isn't for children
The paper wasn't important
Look over the papers, please

Who wrote the letter?
Who was the letter written to?
What's the date of the letter?
What is the letter about?
He didn't stop the car
The car didn't move
The car isn't worth repairing
The car didn't stop
Did the car look old?
The car doesn't run fast
Will you show me the picture?
Let's begin with that question
What was he up to then?
It's slow
I didn't know what to do then
It'll be too late then
What were you doing then?
I'm sure of the fact
When did the accident happen?
Who will try the case?
What time does the game start?
How does the paper feel?

Ah!
Don't force the child to eat

You can't miss it

I'll take the yellow one
Let's sing the English song

Did you see it?
The movie is X-rated

Can you see the difference?
I can't seize the meaning
I can't approve the plan
His idea wasn't usable
The loan carries 5.5% interest

And here I am, still alive
Don't leave it open
Will you take me there?
Let's go and see him there
Will you please go there?
I don't know how to get there
I'll ask how to get there
How often have you been there?
I've been there a few times
Was there a lot of traffic?
It's a very big and busy city
It's at the corner
There's always somebody there
He's pretty much my type
I'll take you there
Who is standing there?
I'd like to keep the car there
I'm very glad I wasn't there
You'd better go there on foot
I've been there already
I've never been there before
Move!
You're in my way
Who's there?
I'll come and get you
Jesus' mother was there
Who did you meet there?
Did you see anybody there?
What did you do there?

That's where you're mistaken
I'd like the sauce on the side
Is there any sauce left?
No, there is none.
I'll tell him that
It doesn't take very long
Don't be so reserved
Don't take it so hard!
Don't you think so?
Do you think so?
Don't be so self-assertive
That's no excuse
That's just how I was raised
You won't get it so easily
No, I don't think so
I don't agree
Well, when exactly?
You're right, it fits
Really?
Yes, well, that depends
Well, I clean the rooms
Well, I bake bread
Well, I watch television
Oh, OK
Well, can you get me one?
You're right
Yes, it is
That's right", said John
I can't help doing that
That a boy!
Then twelve o'clock came
I can't be sorry
Don't get so irritated
That's not my favorite topic
That's not the problem
That's why I was late
That's why I came back so soon
Don't talk about such a thing
Get him!
You said it!
Yup!
O.K. I'm glad you could come
That's a blessed lie
Which way is Central Park?
I'm not at all tired
I don't care a bean
Do keep practicing!
I do hope you'll come again
If you must, you must
I'd love to see the movie
Do write to me soon!
I'd love to dance with you

Do you have cough drops?
I can't stop coughing
I'd like to use a safe
I'm looking for a sweater
The Swallows are ahead 4 to 1!
It's fun to play, too
I'd like to report a theft
May I trouble you for a light?
I'm sorry, I dropped my knife
I'm afraid you can't
Sorry, but I have to hurry
Will you please let me go now?
Sorry?
Pardon?
Sorry, the line is busy now
I'm sorry, I'm busy right now
I'm sorry I did you wrong
Excuse me, I'm lost
May I get by?
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Would you mind turning around?
I'd like to rent a car
Excuse me, but I feel sick
I beg your pardon?
May I get through?
Sorry, I wish you wouldn't
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
Sorry, I can't accommodate you

I can't close my fly
Did Spot go, too?
Do you like playing sports?
Could you spell it, please?
I'm satisfied with everything
How about some Spanish food?
Could we have a spoon?
You're driving too fast
How did your speech go?
It's a nice day, isn't it?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
I've got a splendid idea
I'm not used to spicy food
Where can I buy snacks?
It's necessary to avoid stress
I'm feeling stressed
Can I play the stereo?
Stella really is dead!
That's a gorgeous color
What kind of beer is that?
What a beautiful sweater!
That's a nice T-shirt
How would you like your steak?
We've been having good weather
He's been batting a thousand
It's been hot and humid
I've been thinking about it
What have you been doing?
I've clean forgotten
It's all laid on
Does it hurt a lot?
It's freezing
Can you guess how happy I am?
That's a lot!
It's amazing, just like that
What a gorgeous bash!
It's amazing
Terrific!
Brilliant!
That's too much!
God, this place looks great
Great!
Let's get together sometime
Wow!
Don't forget your ice skates
I hope you'll soon get well
I'll be back in no time
Don't be long
I'll be back in a few minutes
I'll soon catch up with you
Will it clear up soon?
You don't need to go at once
We'll begin work soon
Let's begin our work at once
I'm coming
I'll be along soon
Is there a telephone near by?
You'll soon be able to swim
You can't miss it
Could I have a screwdriver?
I'll be back soon
I'll be back in a wink
We'll check on it right now
You'd better go to bed at once
Should I fill it in now?
You shouldn't leave at once
Let's start right away
You'll have to start at once
Must I start at once?
Must I leave at once?
Get out of here immediately!
I'm coming at once
You'd better go home at once

What's your favorite sport?
Let’s go now
Otherwise, we'll be late
And then?
What else?
I didn't expect it
Why is he so quiet?
I'm not as happy now
Can I borrow this umbrella?
How old is this dog?
Do you often travel abroad?
May I speak to the professor?
You should have seen it!
It exists here..
And don't forget their brother
For whom do the bells toll?
Let's see who wins!
This student's books are new
What can I do?
What I've done!
This was Rodica's fifth book
The third power of 3 is 27
My wife is a native of Ürümqi
What's your name?
That's the help we need
Unfortunately, she is absent
Let's race to the Izakaya!
I'm thinking of going
We'll buy one car for each
Please say ‘yes’!
What's the date today?
God willing..
At last, she executed the plan
You don't have any money
Don't you have any money?
I'd be happy to help you
Hello, who is this?
Crap!
My girlfriend is already back!
What should we do?!
I don't like your girlfriend
Good luck on the exam!
That's correct
I haven't seen him since then
As I thought, she's a virgin!
Why is he called Panda?
Do you want to know my secret?
It's very simple..
Kidding!
We didn't intend to attack him
I'll pay by Visa
I don't meet him so often
It’s a quarter past eight
Maybe, maybe not..
Do you have any drinks?
Does she like oranges?
May I eat this orange?
You'd better believe it
Hey guys, please be quiet
Don't stand near me
We've arrived
Well, let's get going!
Well, let's go
Hey you!
What an idiot I am!
I've been wanting to see you
I really am unlucky!
That's my favorite chair
I'm walking with her
Don't touch my camera
Am I wrong?
He'll be done soon
What do you do for a living?
What's your occupation?
When can we eat, I wonder
It's exactly as you say it is
You've been deceived
Where is my clock?
Where are my watches?
Where are my clocks?
It's for you to decide
God shave the Queen!
Kentucky screams "fuck
Was it a car or a cat I saw?
I can't remember his name
I like this color, too
Either you go, or I go
I'll pay
What do you eat for breakfast?
Where in Canada are you from?
You don't need to hurry
You didn't need to take a taxi
He's not as tall as you are
Why were you there?
I won't talk to him anymore
You're right
You're Germans, aren't you?
I don't cry easily
Let's see what will happen
May I park here?
No, you can't.
Who was Number One?
I'm doing this for you
Are you married?
This is my father's
Ann doesn't have any sisters
Ann doesn't have a sister
The class begins at 8:30
Physician, heal thyself
Where have you come from?
No problem!
They weren't at home yesterday
He's famous around the world
It's OK
Why were you picking up guys?
Let's do it
Let's try it
What is this shit?
What the bloody fuck is that?
Good evening, how are you?
What's this?
If I could be like that..
I can't see anything
I'm sure that he'll get angry
I'll just introduce myself
You don't even try to help me
You're completely right
I've a yen for adventures
It's a messy situation
Let's have a try
It's just that I admire you
Do you like sci-fi movies?
I'm a lefty
At last we meet!
I'll stay here for a bit
Do you speak French?
I don't wear glasses anymore
You OK?
Wha-..
Yes, it's nothing.
He's not serious
Is it splendid, this world?
Rock, paper, scissors
I'm glad I met you today
Did you buy this book?
Good day, how are you?
I'm good at Japanese
There's no such word as "can't
I'm afraid it won't work
I think it won't succeed
Trang's party was like a wake
Woman observes, man decides
Where are you going?
This is a no-swimming zone
He's very soft-hearted
Die already!
Liar today, thief tomorrow
He that will lie, will steal
Shillings, not greetings
You're a human
Can your mom drive a car?
What a nice sounding word!
Do you like tennis?
I've got to get to sleep soon
Really?
Yes, really.
How did you reply?
What is the problem?
What other options are there?
Happy Canada Day!
It's quiet in the suburbs..
What did the doctor say?
Long time, no see
It's been a long time
I haven't seen you for a while
I haven't seen you for ages
Wow!
It's been a long time
I haven't seen you in ages
Hey, you!
No running by the pool!
I'm a good taxi driver
Your nose is dripping.
S-sorry.
Go to school!
I'm going out in an hour
Don't worry!
He got 90% in English
You idiot!
Happy Fourth of July!
40, 50, is a snot-nosed brat
When will you get married?
There's no one in the room
I don't think he'll come
Isn't that annoying?
Isn't Shinji a pain?
He is, isn't he?
Age?" "16.
How old are you?
I'm sixteen.
Yes, what of it?
I can do it by myself!
I'll try harder next time
I'm sorry, but I'm going home
I don't like movies
She doesn't need to work
That furniture is my mother's
I'll return at 6:30
Going off-line for a bath
Are you OK?
I'm fine!
Hello, are you Mr Ogawa?
The TV's on
He's still at work
They aren't here yet
I've put on weight recently
Is it okay if I take a break?
Wouldn't you like to eat?
Emet, we need more meat!
Do you have vegetarian pilaf?
How many kebabs will you have?
He sang on-stage
Let's eat a watermelon!
Please take me out for dinner!
There's no manti right now
They haven't arrived yet
I'd better get to bed soon
Is that answer right?
What happened to your nose?
I can't stand that noise
I can't do any more than this
I can't understand this at all
I don't believe so
He's too fat
Are you?
You hit for 120 points!
Chris swung his sword!
Chris gets 7 gold coins!
He's a weak-willed man
What kind of food do you have?
A Mr. So and So came today
Are you an Uighur?
Really?
No!
I was joking!
There's no beer here
What should I buy?
Actually, I don't.
It means fear of long words.
How ironic.
I'll go on living without you
It's you I've come for
It's hot
You've traded bad for worse
I don't like Alice
I'm not an Uighur
I'm a Russian
Who is taller, Ken or Taro?
The Russians are coming!
I'm setting off tonight
He doesn't have any children
Long time, no see
It ain't like before, you know
I can't stand this noise
Hey, Mimi!
How's it going?
He's too fat
Let's meet this afternoon
Bill, give me a call tonight
I'm a new student
He's always dissatisfied
He'll be there in ten minutes
Actually, I'd also like to go
Could I take the next one?
When do you get up?
Two hours.
You like it?
OK, you're a taxi.
She said: "I'm very happy.
But why take the risk?!
Please don't get mad, sir!
I'm a new worker!
Are there taxis around here?
What time do you go to work?
Ostriches can't fly
Demetrius is slandering me!
Fuck you all to hell!
Even so, you are a human
All's clear, Boss!
Be calm!
Gimme a look-see
Hold it, are you kidding me?
It's completely visible
There she is!
I've used up three notebooks
That didn't do them any good
We don't have enough time
Is that clear?
It's in good hands
I'll never come back
He's a wonderful educator
He is good-natured
Will the police come?
There's no one sitting here
I can't find the knife
Do you want pepper on it?
No song, no supper
Those are my CD's
We won't approach the enemy
Don't let the enemy get close
The enemy can't get close
The enemy won't get close
I'm sitting on the sofa
I've heard that Robert is ill
It wasn't real love
The food's not ready yet
Pay attention!
Double-click on the icon
Double-click the icon
That was double-dutch to me
Good night!
I'm a nomad for life
I don't know the details
I got a makeup-induced rash
He's really angry
I'm unemployed
I don't care a fig about it!
How many of you will there be?
He's a very talented man
One can't live without water
I'm in good health
How did dinner go yesterday?
Let's order twenty kebabs!
As you order!
Can I come in?
Who's working tonight?
Do you eat meat?
People can't live without air
Where's the cook?
Is a thousand yen enough?
You're my best friend
What precisely does that mean?
There's a lot to see in Paris
The watch doesn't work
He's in Tokyo
Who is it?
I haven't the time to read
What time is it?
Hi, how's it going?
Are the passengers all aboard?
Good luck!
When did you meet her?
It's fucking hot
The rat's here!
Go call the cat!
Tom's at the door
Please don't speak too quickly
Would you like to see it now?
Just a moment ..
He's photogenic
Are you new?
Don't be late to school again
How are you doing today?
Never!
We're going home
I've got a 38.9 degree fever
He said: "Leave me alone!
He said: "Leave me in peace!
Your name, please
Be quiet!
You came alone today?
May I eat this hamburger?
Do you have paper?
What do you know about him?
In my opinion, he's right
If you bite me, I'll bite back
There's a yellow rose
Will you sell me your house?
Yesterday, I bought a red car
My father doesn't like soccer
I think he's right
We hadn't credited this report
He's certain to succeed
He's big and strong
I'm in a swimming club
I wasn't aware
Was his story true?
Was her story true?
Don't go out, as it's raining
Are you from Urumqi?
Learn Uyghur!
Are all the passengers aboard?
You're right
What sort of play is it?
I'm only thinking of you
I can't care anymore
I'm going away
What's going on in this town?
Is this real?
This is Cao Cao's trickery
We're also out of eggs
Will you come back tomorrow?
How many books does he have?
I'm busy
I'm bored
Gentlemen, start your engines
He's feeling really low
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
I'm a little taller than you
I've already seen the film
What the hell are you doing?
I'm very happy to see you
Don't be that worried
Your problems don't concern me
I doubt that I'm a good writer
Woe to the vanquished!
Woe to the conquered!
Go back, Satan!
Faster, higher, stronger!
Let there be light!
Thus always to tyrants!
Oh the times!
Oh the customs!
Forgive me, for I have sinned
Where's your date tonight?
She's a stubborn girl
Like me, Lucy has many friends
How much does this cost?
Could you call me back later?
I can't take his behaviour
I'm never angry without reason
No, thanks
He's staying at his aunt's
I'm always busy these days
Why didn't you say so earlier?
A little louder, please
What did you say?
What did you say?
Could you please say it again?
It's impossible
I'll do it
Hurry up!
We'll be late
Come on, guys, let's hurry
That's right!
Could you turn it down?
What're you saying?
Do you like it?
Don't move
You understand, don't you?
Wonderful!
Fantastic!
Awesome!
What will you use it for?
For what purpose?
It's dangerous!
Go away!
It's business
It's work
It's my job
It doesn't matter to me
Get down on the floor!
I'll take care of it
I think I'm right
I'll give you five dollars
Yes, I know it
I'm a person
I'm a human
You're a person
What's the name of this tune?
I've run out of money
I don't have any money
Were you shot?
Have you been shot?
That's too bad
But it does move!
What I'm saying is true
I'm telling you the truth
I'm wishing for that
I'm hoping that will happen
I've seen that
I can't do it either
Don't touch it
Don't touch these
I will never tell!
It's a nice day
It's a clear day
That's absolutely right
Don't get fat
Do you have a fever?
Please don't ask
I'm serious
That's enough
Did you call?
It's about five miles
It's lunch time
It's time to eat lunch
Is it raining where you are?
It's clear.
Is that it?
Take care of yourselves!
It's not a big deal
Don't worry about it
Has anything changed?
Oh!
That's too bad
Oh!
I'm sorry to hear that
Do I have to do it over again?
I'm completely exhausted
I'm really tired
Of course!
It's my CD, isn't it?
I'm a good-for-nothing bum
Have there been any changes?
Don't worry about it
It's my treat
I can't stand this heat
I'm OK
Your manners aren't very good
Yes, I have a good idea
I'm very hungry
That's right
It's a secret
How complex is it?
I've had enough
I'm full
My stomach's full
Finally, it's Friday
I told you to stop, didn't I?
You're kidding!
You're joking!
I think it's OK
You were late, weren't you?
I didn't get what you wrote
Minors aren't allowed to enter
Follow my white plume!
I'm very busy
You're really wonderful
I'll buy this
40 Euros for a scarf?
I've lost about 80 cents

I am forty-five years old
I am leaving at ten o'clock
Can you help me, please?
I'm not good at Latin
I am sorry, the line is busy
Shall I call again?
I can't add anything else
I can't be without you
I can't find my luggage
I didn't do it on purpose
I didn't realise
I don't know what to order
I don't like windy days
I don't feel comfortable here
I don't have any money on me
I don't know what to say
I don't know where they are
I don't know
I don't like sweet desserts
I don't understand you
I don't speak Chinese
I don't want this shirt
I feel all hopeful about..
Why?
I go to bed at 10.30
I have a few tickets in row 15
I can't either freery breathe
I haven't the faintest idea
I'll kill you
How much does it cost?
I lost my passport!
I need 30 more days to pay
I need a doctor!
I need anti-itch ointment
Where is the pharmacy?
I owe you $1,000
When will you wash your car?
Sometime this week, I think.
I think that Juan likes María
I wake up at 7 o'clock
Where is the bookstore?
I want to call..
I was born in 1988 in York
I was hoping you'd say that
Celebrate in style!
Almaty is my favorite city!
You want to work at METRO?!
You are a toilet!
Unity is our strength!
Once a thief, always a thief
One for all, all for one
God's will first
The Pope?
How many divisions has he got?
Yes, we can go
I'll let you decide
It's Monday today
You're good with women
Can I ask a question?
Be yourself!
Our rates are now lower!
There's no food right now
Oh, the humanity!
She's our neighbour
Where are my glasses?
And so is your face!
Who is the happiest of men?
Which is the best government?
We don't know her
I've already come here before
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Let's race to the pub!
When did this occur?
You're completely right!
You're absolutely right!
Do you live with your parents?
You're the boss
I've been here before
If you're hungry, then eat
You didn't understand
The power's out
I've done questionable things
We don't do body counts
Who's at fault?
Whose fault is it?
Of course I'll wait
It's time to get up
Who drew it?
What's the weather like?
It's as cold as ice
That's a pheasant
That's a good plan
That's a good idea
I'm 19
Copy-and-paste is very useful
Are these your things?
Let's get started
Let's go, Ken
Great, isn't it?
That's not fair
That isn't fair
Isn't it black?
Is that pure gold?
Can you teach me?
Did you see my cat?
No.
Liar, you're still chewing!
It's too quiet
I'll phone you later
He doesn't charge much
Can all birds fly?
I'm fed up!
Have you ever been abroad?
Why do I have to do this?
What are you cooking?
What did you talk about?
Where is Customs?
Right, shall we be off then?
Let's go!
Yes, let's
You're perfectly right
That's all the thanks one gets
It's nothing, don't be afraid!
They are among us!
It's all the rage
Do you want me to paint you?
You've come back?
To the devil with you!
My brothers!
That's not a grasshopper
It's a locust!
I'm sick!
I'm ill
Thanks indeed, handy this!
Stop!
I'm so unlucky!
When did you move to Berlin?
Let's beat Japan!
Thanks!
May I begin to eat?
I am going to bed!
Am I wasting my time?
Has the world gone mad?
Can a person go mad like this?
Do you think you'd get ill?
What if it continued for ever?
This is strangely addictive!
Are you very seriously ill?
Do you have a receipt?
Maybe he won't become famous
There's no need to apologize
Let's postpone dinner
There isn't any soap
It's snowing
Brace yourselves!
Why?
It's nothing serious
It's nothing to worry about
Let's fly a kite
What's that bird called?
When's it over?
When does it finish?
Let's eat sushi
It's frozen hard

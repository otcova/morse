I've changed that
I've come to help
I've fed the fish
I've already fed the fish
Have you fed the fish?
Have you already fed the fish?
I've had a lot of fun here
I've lost so much
I've lost a lot
I've already begun
I've already started
I've already voted
I haven't voted yet
I've been deceived
I've been defeated
I've changed a lot
I've done it right
I've done it wrong
I've earned a rest
I've just returned
I've made progress
I think I've paid too much
I've achieved a lot
I've arrived safely
I've been convicted
I've been very good
I've been well paid
I've done very well
I've drunk too much
I've earned a break
I've had a bad time
I've had a long day
I've improved a lot
I've just been shot
I think that I've met my match
I think I've met my match
I've paid my dues
I haven't yet paid my dues
I haven't paid my dues yet
I've started eating meat again
I've still got time
I've talked it over with Tom
It's a rather quixotic goal
She's engaged to be married
How can I connect with God?
Her fiancee wasn't Muslim
Muslims don't reject Jesus
Islam doesn't reject Jesus
They're not Muslim
They became Muslim in 2004
I'm Muslim now
I want to become Muslim.
What?
Do you want to be Arab?
We're here to talk about Islam
I'm a servant of God
What?
How was the movie?
It was tedious to watch.
Have you found the flashdrive?
He's burning old books
I don't like this font
Have you seen a doctor?
Have you been to see a doctor?
It's boring here
it's an ancient aqueduct
He sat half-turned towards me
It's a reproduction item
It's a famous quote
They're low-quality
It's an armistice
It's a lifebuoy ring
It's a neighbouring country
It's an enemy country
It's a very beautiful song
Thank you for your help.
No problem.
Thank you for your help.
Don't mention it.
Don't get scared
I don't like this music
It's a wonderful song
What a smart-ass
It's mainly clear today
What is your wife's shoe size?
â€œLook at them!
I've worked so hard
I've been so worried
I've had a complaint
I've had a good year
I've had it analyzed
I've helped Tom a lot
I've let myself go
I've lost some blood
I've made that clear
I've never lost hope
I've ordered a pizza
I've really improved
I've run out of time
I've seen three wars
I've waited too long
I've already finished
I've already fixed it
I've always been weak
I've been cooperative
I've done enough harm already
I've dropped my pen
I've given up on love
I've had a great week
I've had my problems
I've had some success
I've learned a lesson
I've lost my funding
Tom and I've never been apart
I've never been this happy
I've never gone there
I've only got an hour
I've run out of paint
I've run out of sugar
I've run out of water
I've taken a big risk
I know I've been shot
I know that I've been shot
I've already forgotten
I don't like Tom's car
I broke Tom's coffee cup
You're having fun
You're having fun, aren't you?
Tom's bus has arrived
Tom's dog is here
Tom's mother died
Why did Tom cheat?
Does Tom like dogs?
I've already got a job
I don't have a job yet
I don't yet have a job
I've already said that
I've been disqualified
I've been here a while
I've been here an hour
I've been lucky so far
So far, I've been lucky
I've been pretty lucky
I've been right so far
I've been up all night
I've been awake all night
I've been very patient
I've been warned three times
I've called the police
I've been to a new beach
I've been to the new beach
What's on your list?
My list hasn't changed
I went to Tom's place
It's not on my list
He's in Algiers
What are you eating?
It's called couscous.
It's me, Skura
This is her ex-boyfriend
Are you gonna eat that?
He's big enough to do that
Skura is coming, too
I'm gonna take a nap
I'm gonna take a nap.
Me too.
Is he coming, too?
He's a great teacher
He's a great artist
She's just a crazy woman
There's Mr Amzil
Where's Skura's name?
He's our casting director
That's Skura's boyfriend
He's in the kitchen with Skura
What is Skura doing here?
I've come to get her back
Don't mention my name
I don't even know her name
I'm so sorry
They're together again
I think it's a comedy
I think it's a horror movie
I'll never speak to him again
It's so pretentious
More wine, please
Did they see us?
You don't need to call me that
What's our cover story?
Are you staying at this hotel?
Who's asking?
She's a screamer.
What?
She screams when she has sex.
See you back at the motel.
OK.
He doesn't do stunts
I think he's having a stroke
She's just an actress
We're professionals
I have to admit I'm having fun
He's so politically correct
She's perfect
He's a station manager
He's so warm and caring
He's so sexy
He's not racist
It's a little chilly in here
He's a disabled man
He's baseball hero
He didn't notice
He didn't even notice
He's running against you
He's running for city council
You have beautiful hands.
And you're adorable.
She's out of reach
Yes.
Are you OK, Skura?
She's attracted to bad boys
He's a really good guy
She's dating a nice guy
It's always my fault
It's always his fault
He's good at this
That's what the manager said
He's got a plane to catch
He's moving back to Algeria
He's our hero
Just be positive.
How?
He's gone and he left a note
Where should we look first?
She's a sex symbol
Do you google yourself?
It's my morning ritual.
He's playing volleyball
I think we're going to Algeria
What do they think of Algeria?
They're soon going to Algeria
I've come here to help
I've found the problem
I haven't found the problem
I've had no complaints so far
I've had quite a shock
I've had very bad luck
I've just about got it
I've learned that's OK
I've learned that that's OK
I've learned to adjust
I've been left with no choice
I've made several improvements
I've made some changes
He's facing deportation
I've made a few mistakes
I'm horrified by his actions
I think I've omitted something
Is this a gay bar?
We're from Algeria
She's a super model
She's just a regular model
He's an outsider
Where is Skura?
That's our sign language
She's so beautiful to look at
She's wearing mascara
She's a teenager
I'm so touched
He's living on an Amish farm
I don't have food
They're hookers
I don't really know what it is
He's a plastic surgeon
I've got to get to Algeria
I've embraced Islam
They don't even know who I am
This is the governor's wife
He's on the porch
I'm going to stay in Algeria
Why is he so paranoid?
You're not going to prison
We're glad you're home
She's not a virgin
She's trying to attack me
He can't jump
She's a terrible sister
He's her pen pal
I'm gonna come get you
Finally, a decent comment
I've only got this one
I've only just started
I've run out of coffee
Tom and I've said our goodbyes
I've said that already
I've taken precautions
I've tried this before
I haven't tried this before
I've accomplished a lot
My flight leaves at 2:30
I've been a naughty boy
I've been asked to help
I'm a veterinarian
I've been fooled before
I've done what I could
I've done everything I could
We're all high school students
Sorry, I wasn't listening
I've been working on it
Tom wasn't on the beach
Tom isn't on the beach
Mr. Jackson wasn't my teacher
Mr. Jackson isn't my teacher
I've been outmaneuvered
I've been through a lot
I'd bet the farm on it
I've done a lot already
I've done all I can do
I've done what I can do
I'm a mother now
I'm a mom now
I'm a dad now
Who's the boy in this picture?
How big is your apartment?
I'm coming right away
I'm repairing it now
I'm correcting it now
I've learned a lot, too
I've lost valuable time
I've made a bad mistake
I've made a very bad mistake
I've made good progress
I've made a huge mistake
I've made lots of changes
I've made a lot of changes
I've made a stupid mistake
I've made several mistakes
I've made a lot of mistakes
I've made many improvements
I've made too many mistakes
I've made allowances for that
I've made a shocking discovery
I've made arrangements already
I've never had it so good
I've never done it that way
I've never liked you much
I've never liked you very much
I've never coached before
I know I've never done that
See you at Tom's
I'm on my way to Tom's
I was at Tom's yesterday
I've really got to hurry
I've really changed a lot
I've really got to step on it
I've been a very bad boy
I've been affected a lot
I've been down that road
I've been drinking again
I've been lied to before
I've been lucky, I think
I've been doing just fine
I've been harassed before
I've been here three days
I've been told what to do
I haven't been told what to do
I've been very successful
I've been working on this
I've been doing this wrong
I've been gone a long time
I've been very cooperative
I've been working very hard
I've been here over an hour
I've been kidding myself
I've been paid already
I've been ready for an hour
I've been struggling lately
I've been working all night
I've been asked not to leave
I've been asked to stay
I've been asked to sing a song
I don't often take holidays
I can't stand milk
I'm already close to you
Has someone lost something?
He's not answering the phone
She's not answering the phone
I don't have more
What happened with you?
There's not much sunlight now
It's written like that
Who are you criticising?
Let's study Islam
I'm Berber and Muslim
What's a Muslim?
Who are those Muslims?
He's an ex-Muslim
He's on his way to the mosque
Ethnically, I'm Berber
I embraced Islam in 2004
I don't like milk at all
I've been in Boston too long
I've been trying to warn you
I've been waiting for a year
I've been doing that all year
I've been having a lot of fun
I've been keeping pretty busy
I've never been kissed
I've been waiting all morning
I've been waiting three hours
I've been asked to investigate
I've been doing some gardening
I've been given another chance
I've been having some problems
I've been here a couple months
I've been told this many times
I've been told this before
I've been working hard on this
I've been ready a long time
I've been walking in my sleep
I've been a bad boy
I've been here quite a while
I've been here a couple hours
I've been injured before
I've been working since 2:30
When do you plan to visit Tom?
Tom didn't look very satisfied
Tom wasn't speaking French
Tom isn't going to the party
I wasn't really satisfied
I've been thinking about that
Tom's wife is from Boston
I didn't want to visit Boston
Is Boston safe?
Isn't Boston safe?
Then why does he?
Then why doesn't he leave?
Then why doesn't he move?
Why don't you do that anymore?
I'm sure you'll miss Boston
I'm sure that I'll miss Boston
I'm sure I'll miss Boston
It's hot in Boston now
It's cold in Boston now
Can we go to Boston?
I don't miss Boston at all
He's a bastard
He was born in 2004
He can't remember his lines
She's an old widowed woman
He's looking for another woman
We don't need a dog
We don't need a dog.
Really?
Not even this one?
Oh, this one is so cute!
He doesn't even have a dog
She's an Algerian actress
I'm gonna need some coffee
You're a beauty, Skura
He has a doctor's appointment
Can I meet you at four?
He will do it, too
Let's go check out that DVD
Why don't you date her?
He has a brain tumor, too
He's forgetting a few details
You're the expert
I can help.
That's sweet.
It doesn't sound appropriate
He's so entertaining
Are they sharing the same man?
He didn't give her any money
He's not all wrong
He wasn't to be trusted
He didn't escape
Don't do this to me, Skura
My suggestion: get a dog
I can't choose between you two
They're having sex tonight
He knows she's watching
You could say he's gay
He didn't win
She's as beautiful as ever
He's so proud of her
He's my business partner
We're software engineers
Everyone knows he's gay
He's gonna be devastated
Can I tell Skura?
He's straight
I'm married
Is that a problem for you?
I love cheaters.
But you're married!
Does that matter?
He's a priest
He's very handsome
You're not even married yet
He's so forgetful
We've got some time
Imagine he wasn't gay
He's homophobic
We're planning his wedding
He's doubting our relationship
They didn't trust each other
They're a happy couple
He's a raging homophobe
I'm straight
He doesn't trust that doctor
I don't trust her.
Me too.
He's a fraud
I don't need any advice
Who is supposed to do it?
Take me with you!
What are you hidding from me?
We don't need anybody
Do you have any problem?
Can you find a solution?
Which religion is correct?
Islam.
Why isn't everybody Muslim?
I'm straight and I like girls
He's a strict Muslim
Why do you have to be Muslim?
They know that I'm Muslim
Hopefully you'll accept Islam
I'm from an Algerian household
Is this man Muslim?
He came from Algiers, Algeria
Let's go to the mosque now
Skura's father is an imam
He's our new imam
Let's make Algeria great again
I can't do without your help
I've already been to Boston
I've done all I need to do
I've done what I need to do
Canada's no paradise
I don't really like Boston
I'll take you to Boston
I'll take you guys to Boston
I'll take you all to Boston
I won't go back to Boston
It's raining in Boston
We went to Boston in Tom's car
I don't think Tom likes blue
I'd never buy a pink hat
I'd never wear a pink hat
He's not coming
He's going to a funeral
I'm going to a funeral.
Who died?
I'm going to a funeral.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to a funeral.
A funeral?
Who died?
How cute is she?
Wait, I'll walk you out
He's dating Skura
Isn't Skura the best?
He's just so cute
Where is she?
I beg your pardon?
He's our drama teacher
What kind of a monster is he?
I'm standing here before you
How many push-ups did you do?
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
I'm waiting for my friend.
Sorry.
Is that woman gay?
This is my friend, Skura
This is my girlfriend, Skura
This is my girlfriend, Skura.
Nice to meet you.
It's all forgotten
What's the problem?
Is he one of them?
Where is my wig?
Where is my wig?
It's right here.
Where is my Skura?
How are you feeling, Skura?
This means they're afraid
He's confident and talented
He's confident
He's talented
That's not my dream
I quit.
Oh, boy!
Accidents happen.
Bullshit.
They're praying in the mosque
What about your career?
Maybe he's not down there
He's down there
Is he down there?
We don't care about you
You can't fly in this weather
Do people still say that?
He went jogging.
In this weather?
This furniture is my husband's
How much did he pay?
Your phone is ringing.
It's for my son
The message isn't for Skura
He doesn't need sex with you
He's not thinking that
He's a first responder
I hope he's OK
He's probably some place safe
Am I still your friend?
Let's pay separately today
He can't handle that crisis
Can you handle this crisis?
She's straddling his dick
She's too cute
He's not going anywhere
He'll make it for her birthday
He's gonna miss her birthday
She's not going anywhere
Don't worry
He's not going anywhere
Don't worry
He's in jail now
It's way too soon
Do you love him?
I don't know.
Do you love him?
Who?
He couldn't hear anything
I don't know if he heard me
Does it snow in Algiers?
Let's check if the TV works
Let's check if this TV works
Who looks like crap?
He won an Oscar.
You've got to be kidding.
Surgery didn't work
He doesn't have to worry
We're down here
I was thinking about that, too
She's dating a cop
You look fantastic.
Thanks.
We're letting you go.
Fuck you and your company.
We've been to Boston
We've been to Boston already
We've already been to Boston
We haven't yet been to Boston
Tom isn't actually from Boston
Tom doesn't work in Boston
I'll never forget Boston
I'm taking Tom to Boston
We should've gone to Boston
I can't skate very well
I'm not good at skating
I can't go now
Can I really have this?
Can I really keep this?
I can come, too
May I go inside?
Can I have both of these?
May I have this?
May I keep this?
May I stay here for a while?
I can swim, too
I can't swim, either
May I study here?
I'll work on it
I can't sing that song
I don't know how to swim yet
I don't yet know how to swim
I'll finish this later
Let's finish this later
I can't fix anything
I can't move quickly
I didn't move quick enough
I should've moved faster
I can't play the oboe
I'll probably be able to win
Can I put this over there?
May I put this over there?
Don't they want war?
I was at the doctor's
Don't look for me never again!
Is it your signature?
Stop whistling!
Bye, mother
Fuck you, you son of a bitch
You've insulted me
Good morning, Tom!
I'm a cokehead
They'll let her know
Tom is here, I know it
The young man's name is Tom
I've forgotten a lot of French
Tom can read French, can't he?
You teach French, don't you?
Tom doesn't like French
This is French, isn't it?
I taught French to Tom's kids
I taught Tom's kids French
Let's sing in French
Speak French, OK?
My French isn't so bad
It's a French movie
It's a movie in French
Do you read French?
Tom's French is OK
This isn't very good French
Do I have to speak in French?
I'm weak in French
Are you guys Canadians?
Are all of you Canadians?
Is your wife Canadian?
Is your wife a Canadian?
Are you also Canadians?
Are you also a Canadian?
Are you Canadians, too?
Are you a Canadian, too?
I'm taking a French class
I'll read that book in French
I'm a French student
Tom got 90% on his French test
I don't like my French teacher
You, too, can learn French
I'm still learning French
I don't read French novels
I'm reading a French novel
Is it OK to switch to French?
I'm not very good at French
Could we switch to English?
Should I learn French?
Tom learns French, too
You don't have to study French
You don't need to study French
What's this in French?
Why are those girls giggling?
Merry bloody Christmas!
How many animals can you see?
Your taxi is here.
I'm coming.
It's a little cold
Skura is my friend, too
Let's get naked
Let's kiss.
Stop it!
Let's get naked.
Please stop it!
He's a poet
Do you like poetry?
She's slutty
What would he do?
This is Skura's specialty
She kissed Salas.
See?
She's slutty.
You're the one I'm looking for
He's texting her back
He's dating that bimbo
We can't do anything now
We're screwed anyways
I miss you, Skura
I'll stay home
I don't have to tell Skura
They're collecting money
He's a devil
He can't take that ring off
He was cheating on Skura, too
He was cheating on you, too
He's still cheating
Who's up for mojitos?
I've never seen him cry before
He didn't know how to tell you
This is Skura's grandfather
He's about to marry her
He's a selfish bastard
You're fired.
You know what?
You can just go fuck yourself.
What are you doing here.
I came to see my girl.
You're ruining my party
You're so beautiful.
That's so you and I love that.
Are those pineapples real?
Are those coconuts real?
He's not going to eat it
Is this your wedding ring?
Is this your necklace?
Yes.
It's mine now.
He's throwing a party tomorrow
I changed my hair.
Why?
Was it a picture of Skura?
Is this a new ringtone?
Do you like my ringtone?
Do you like this ringtone?
It's a diaper
Are you wearing a diaper?
I'll tell him about that
Oh, where do I start?
You're kind of different.
Do you mean we're backward?
He's a nice person, right?
Where's Skura?
I'm gonna need her too
Is this champagne from London?
He didn't even mention me
It's terrible
He didn't even mention me
I'm so relieved
He's still a virgin
Something else?
Nothing.
Is this your Kabyle dress?
She's a hair expert
Don't mess with Skura
Let's call Skura.
I'm sorry, who?
He's dressed just fine
He's flustered
We're friends and neighbors
I'm so glad you came over
You know what?
I don't need the money
Tell him I'm not ready
She's breathtaking
Thanks for your help.
It's nothing.
He's only forty
What can I get you, guys?
It's a text from my agent
Do you like that band?
He's not wearing socks
Don't anticipate the downbeat
He's the lead singer
He doesn't have to be so bossy
He's angry.
I can't say you're wrong.
Don't move
He turned her down, of course
That's a little cocky
He left.
Who needs him?
She's wearing a funeral suit
I didn't know.
Now you know.
I'm proud of us
I'm sorry that I got so crazy
She's such a bitch
He doesn't like to brag
We've retired him
Where are you going?
Out.
They're making a musical
What an insult!
He's a chauffeur
I'm gonna go to that audition
He couldn't stop
This has never, ever happened
You leave Skura alone!
Are you feeling OK?
Better than OK.
I haven't met his parents yet
He's on drugs
I've a pretty good idea
Can you please take me there?
I'll go get the van
I'll go get the car
I'm Skura
He didn't see anyone
I brought you these lilies.
That's so sweet.
He's sleeping with her, too
I'm drawn to women like you
You've got to be strong
You're driving me crazy, Skura
I am Skura, you idiot!
It's a very heartwarming story
Practise, practise, practise
We don't want you
Please don't stop that
They're gonna go crazy for us
You're Skura, aren't you?
It's a gay bar
He's intoxicated already
He's just so attractive
I'm from Algiers myself
Can I buy you a drink?
No, thanks
Let me get you one.
He's expecting a date
He's completely alone
Is he expecting a date?
I'm very attracted to you
She's so charming
She's gonna win for sure
Is this a drag queen contest?
Did you heard from Skura?
Did you hear from Skura?
She moved to Algiers.
Have you heard from Skura?
She's dead.
What about Salas?
He's dead, too.
Yidir?
Dead.
So everyone is dead.
They're sailing to Algiers
Please don't peek
Did you know my dad?
He doesn't know either
I'm gonna tell him the truth
I'm gonna tell her the truth.
You'll crush her.
She doesn't know either
He's very good at that
He's a strong man
Isn't he fabulous?
Step back, please
It was sweet of you, guys
Who turned this scale back?
Why are braces so expensive?
We're all going to Boston
It's hard to break bad habits
Who is your French teacher?
Who can speak French?
Do you all speak French?
Do you have French newspapers?
Does anyone speak French here?
Tom's French isn't perfect
Tom didn't sing in French
Tom wasn't singing in French
This isn't written in French
This isn't in French
We're going to stay in Boston
Let's learn French
I'm studying French drama
I've dislocated my knee
If you get tired, take a break
It's not very interesting here
Tom's dog is dangerous
Why aren't you scared?
There's no reason to go
We're going to be teachers
I won't wait a minute longer
Why aren't you wearing a hat?
How many children can you see?
How many cars can you see?
I'm an adult now, too
Mark the right answer, please
How are you learning French?
I'm helping Tom learn French
French isn't complicated
I think Tom isn't Canadian
Tom and Mary don't know French
They don't know French
Who speaks French well?
I'm going to speak French
I'm Tom's French tutor
This word isn't French
This isn't a French word
Yesterday, I had a dream
He won't come
She's German and she's Muslim
We're all from Algeria
He's still going to the mosque
He went to Algeria in 2004
She's got amazing qualities
My parents are 100% Algerian
Why didn't the imam come?
I'm praying.
Can I come in for a moment?
Why are you wasting your time?
I'm praying.
I'll get paid in the next life
He wasn't openly religious
He was a convert, too
He was a Muslim convert, too
He's the only Muslim in town
I'm ready to accept Islam
Are you becoming an Arab?
I've converted to Islam.
Are you becoming a Pakistani?
I've converted to Islam.
I don't gamble
I'm Muslim
I don't drink
I'm Muslim
I don't party
I'm Muslim
They're new Muslims

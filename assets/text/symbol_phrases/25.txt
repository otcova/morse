Why is there anything?
What does two and two make?
I've got hiccups
He couldn't come yesterday
Just thirteen people?
Is that all?
Let's sit at the back
I'm lasagne mad
I'm mad about lasagne
Maybe he'll ring today
Maybe he'll phone today
Tom lives in England.
It's closed today.
Ah, yeah, it's Tuesday
It was just as I'd thought
I didn't see him or her
I'd rather walk than drive
Are you on the train now?
Are you now on the train?
She needs a hip replacement.
I think I've heard this before
That's really cool
Do you remember last night?
It's a mystery how it happened
Thank God it wasn't real
There's someone in my room
You'll just embarrass yourself
He enjoys a well-rounded diet
Why did he move here?
It's been raining for a while
I don't get it
How many were in the group?
Did you see the sunrise?
I love Vijay Prashad.
Who's that
Some Bollywood actor?
This is bad news for Europe.
Can't you compromise?
This is the compromise.
Who's the one on the left?
Tom isn't very confrontational
It really doesn't bother you?
I'll send Tom there
Can I phone you later?
Shall we change the place?
Certainly.
Don't you see?
Of course.
How old are you now, child?
It's small and cute
Why are you talking bullshit?
After rain, the nice weather
Five more minutes!
Please wait five more minutes!
Ziri's life turned upside down
Don't make rejection personal
Don't ask just anyone to dance
Don't reject people
Don't call her a bitch
Ziri didn't want to be mean
One day, things took a turn
Just then, Ziri came running
Ziri knocked on Rima's door
Ziri can't give up that easily
This is your contract.
Am I dreaming?
Please sign here.
We don't give a damn!
Without a doubt, you're right
You guys are right, of course
Yeah, you guys are right
Hooray for Dutch farmers!
That's not true
Some of them are both!
Foxes are so adorable!
I suspect he's coming
I suppose he's coming
It hasn't rained
I'm coming tonight
We've had snow for some time
A return ticket, please
A return, please
A table for four, please
She's already seen us
We've got to go
They're getting into the lift
They're going into the lift
Take whichever one you want.
I'll pick up the room key
That's my personal favourite
What was the weather forecast?
Who is their form teacher?
Tom's always sponging off us
I've spoken to her about you
And that's all you remember?
And that's all you know?
No, it's not a given
Come here!" said Mary to Tom
It's now eight years ago
It's not dry at all
I hope it's helpful
I don't think that's love
I don't think it's love
Do you really never do that?
Are you really not happy here?
Are you really not married?
It's time to start having fun
Don't call it spaghetti
I'm an Olympic medalist
The joys are short-lived
Everyone wins!
They're so tall!
Is it cold?
What does she want from you?
Is the lake still cold?
Oh!
Love, love, love!
Where are we on the path?
Don't forget your keys
Could you pass me that sponge?
To whom is it of advantage?
Could you shut that fan off?
Who's this little rascal?
Can you pick up a tomato?
You could say I'm shy
And don't skimp on the bacon!
What can you conclude?
What's causing this?
Could you turn that fan off?
That's my personal favorite
That's why I love this man!
Don't say mean words to anyone
Don't get excessively angry
What makes you angry?
Are you feeling more relaxed?
How do you handle your anger?
Did Ziri's advice help you?
Is Ziri a threat to you?
Why do you feel threatened?
What pissed Ziri off?
Please keep showing up!
Tell me about your crush!
Please do what's necessary
They're easily flattered
Ziri showed up in Rima's life
Ziri showed up in Rima's home
Where is the women's room?
Makan!
(Eat!
Eat!)
Or just for fun?
Why did you stop?
What is happening?
He said, "Não?
(No?)
We'll return in a month
We'll be back in a month
What color are the tires?
I live in Gdańsk
I can't leave you alone here
Ha ha, I must laugh
NATO, WHO and the other ones
It's ten to eight
It's 7.50
Who'll replace you?
I don't condemn you for that
I won't condemn you for that
It means that it's healing
I go to bed before 10 p.m
Are you looking?
Looking for what?
For love.
Not really, no.
It's a bank holiday here today
What do you think of the film?
Dead boring.
Do you cook at home?
No, not at all
When is she arriving?
In about an hour.
You'll do it easily!
Ziri's comics came out
You're angry now, aren't you?
I arrived at about 2 p.m
In reality, nothing was fine
He's wearing a posh suit
I've found the rope ladder
I'd rather speak to her first
Does she live close by?
Does she live in the area?
Ziri's boss was rarely there
Did you become my enemy?
Is there no one who loves you?
Enemies don't sleep
So, what's your name?
I was afraid you'd never ask.
Is the Pope Catholic?
I'm bored anyway
When are you free next week?
It'd be extremely helpful
It's completely fine
It's completely fine
I'm a Millennial
They made a funny joke, though
How are you?
I've been better.
Everything's great here
Thank you!
How are you?
I've been much worse.
I guess that wasn't enough
Am I supposed to do that?
They didn't react at all
Why do you ignore Tom?
What did he do to you?
Why do you ignore Tom?
What has he done to you?
I broke Tom's glasses
Not really.
I hope you'll sing for us
We'll let you know what's new
I'll fix that tomorrow
X Æ A-Xii is bullied in school
Have you heard Manu Chao sing?
Do you know iLe's full name?
You would say that, Tom
Is she your relative?
It's fine; I understand
It's so old school
I like one of Zivert's songs
That's prohibited
That's not permitted
That's forbidden
The bomb's gone off
You'll have to make a choice
We don't know him that well
How much longer?
Are you hiding somewhere?
They're well-mannered
Why are you interested in her?
He's talking about him
What a nerd!
What a nice butterfly!
Avoid this!
Feet off the table!
She's afraid of hospitals
How did you pull this off?
Protect him at all costs!
Then I have your permission?
More's the pity
Who built this doghouse?
Tom won't get that job
He didn't come either
What can you serve quickly?
You needn't wait
It's finally working again
It's working again at last
I've never driven a bus
I'm getting ready to go
She's travelling the world
She's going round the world
She's doing a world tour
Does she come from England?
Is she from England?
It won't rain
It's not going to rain
When is closing time?
How often do you go drinking?
It's going well today
How are you?
Pretty good.
How are you?
Not bad.
How are you?
I've never been better.
What kind of mushroom is this?
I wish you'd come with us
Don't stay up late
Don't stay out late
You'd better go on a diet
I don't feel like staying home
I'm sorry
We're sold out
Does the price include tax?
That's very cheap, isn't it?
Where's my seat?
I think that's barmy
Won't you please come in?
They're in bed
I'm having a rest now
Here's the bakery
I've had plenty
He's cleaning the windows
Is that a football pitch?
I'm sure we'll find something
Come this way, please
We'd like to have breakfast
What's the name of this park?
It just doesn't happen
I'm somewhat busy
We don't sleep much
We don't get much sleep
You're too early
Can't you see that I'm busy?
Can't you see I'm busy?
I'd appreciate your advice
Is the station far from here?
It's getting late
What's your opinion about it?
What do you intend to do now?
When are you leaving Boston?
That's my favourite band
How many do you want to buy?
How many did you buy?
How much do I owe you in all?
How much is a one-way ticket?
How much is it altogether?
How much is the admission fee?
What does it cost to get in?
What colour is his jumper?
I'd be delighted to come
I'm sorry I can't stay longer
The figures don't lie
Show me another one, please
Well, I must be going now
He wouldn't stop talking
Who is the match commentator?
What flight did you arrive on?
I don't have a reservation
I'd better be going now
I'm afraid I must go now
I'm afraid I must leave now
I'm afraid I don't have time
Is there a bus to the zoo?
Is this water good to drink?
It's time for me to go home
Let's get together sometime
Are banks open today?
Are you satisfied with it?
Could you help me carry this?
Could I use your telephone?
Do I pay now or later?
Do you want me to pay now?
Haven't you made a mistake?
How did you enjoy your trip?
How do I get there from here?
Is Tom coming tomorrow?
In Algiers, space is finite
In Algiers, space is limited
Is Tom having problems?
Where do I sign my name?
Which do you like better?
Which way is the station?
Will you show me the way?
Who told you to do this?
Will you take a seat, please?
Will you take care of this?
Would you like any help?
Would you like to sit here?
Tom doesn't eat desserts
Tom doesn't eat cookies
Let's go someplace quiet
What's wrong, Tom?
You can't sleep?
How about I read you a book?
Why is Ireland so rich?
Algeria's story is different
In 2003, the US invaded Iraq
Do you google your name?
Every morning.
The US is China's archenemy
He was called a "living legend
He didn't miscalculate
Tom didn't reply to anybody
How to verify your account?
Tom shouldn't see it
Tom's behaviour is strange
What all came in the box?
Do you need me to move?
I'm sure of that
You're going the wrong way
You'll have to turn around
I'm not ashamed of you
Pizza's good.
Donate now!
They're easy to understand
Oh, is that so..
I've got to sleep early today
I'm getting spam again
Were you seen by anyone?
Did anyone see you?
He's a big fan
Collect them all!
Is Tom a reliable narrator?
That's a cute cat
That's a scary cat
Ziri's face went blank
Where should I meet you?
That's a day I'll never forget
I'm a traveler
I'm a waitress
I'm alone, too
I'm an actress
I'm away a lot
I'm colorblind
I'm coming now
I'm conflicted
I'm doing this
I'm dying here
I'm expendable
I'm fine alone
I'm fine today
I'm flat broke
I'm getting up
I'm going nuts
I'm going to fall
I'm good to go
I'm hanging up
I'm holding on
I'm just crazy
I'm moving out
I'm moving out next week
I'm never busy
I'm never busy on weekends
I'm not a brat
I'm not a geek
I'm not a lady

I'm not a good shot
I'm not a drug dealer
I'm not a taxi driver
I'm not a psychiatrist
I'm not a patient guy
I'm not a suspicious person
Just wait a moment, please
Will China invade Taiwan?
It's highly doubtful
The US can't stop China's rise
Tom didn't answer my message
He's irresponsible!
I'm going back to Boston today
Don't become like her
This hurt Ziri's career
Ziri's movie was awful
She's so cute
Quiet!
Fuck the Founding Fathers!
I'm smoking weed
That's just what I want to do
It's her house
Can't you walk?
OK, let's go
OK, let's leave
Do you need this?
It's cold, isn't it?
About how long will this take?
I see you, and you see me
Thanks for the link!
It'll be dear
Have you notified everyone?
Have you informed everyone?
It's teatime
I hope it'll continue to rain
I hope it'll keep raining
I'm glad it's raining
I'm glad that it's raining
Russians are self-reliant
I haven't got much time
Ziri's Berber is awful
Ziri's Berber is so bad
I prefer women's football
Ziri can't do this now
Ziri can't come now
Ziri won't do this
What!
Let's kiss...
Nah!
Brush your teeth, first!
Ziri's parents disappeared
We'll think it over
Ziri's words broke Rima
How do I get to the playhouse?
How do I get to the theatre?
Ziri was Rima's business rival
Ziri's parents were gone
That's my settee
That's my sofa
Ziri's eyes were getting teary
There's no beer in the fridge
Ziri's offer was tempting
Ziri took the company's seal
Ziri arrived at Rima's place
No, I'm not in love
Why did you fire the butler?
Ziri got tired of Rima's gifts
Don't be disheartened
He's my boyfriend
Don't make that face
Ziri likes his life drama-free
Where's the nearest tram stop?
We can't accept your terms
Ziri ran to Rima's room
Rima's skin is so stressed
It's been you all along, Rima
I... love you!
You'll never be a reporter
I'll come if I've got time
It's been a stressful week
The US doesn't belong in Asia
Can I stay at your place?
Sure!
Come over!
Do you want to come with?
Back to the club?
Wanna come with?
Not tonight.
Was the world made by chance?
Certainly not.
Was the world made by chance?
Surely not.
I know, Tom
Did you bring the book?
I did, believe me.
Today, Tom was rude to me
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
Really?
And why?
You're a jerk to everyone.
Don't complain to me
You don't have a lot of money
Even alone, I feel great
Today I'm doing wonderful
I'm not at your disposal
You've returned to Akbou
You're my boyfriend
What a miserable job!
I'm a translator, not a doctor
I'm a writer, not a translator
Tom is a highly-paid plumber
I don't like this
Has Tom already started?
I'm sure I can help you today
Tom didn't say anything more
I don't know what Tom might do
Tom wasn't a close friend
It's all clear now
Tom isn't successful
It's OK to want validation.
Tom is Mary's paramour
The car's engine is tractable
We're all on stipends
I'm the mayor
Tom isn't hungry
Did something happen earlier?
Isn't it good?
How many prisoners escaped?
It's OK, isn't it?
We're all furries here
My bad.
You're fine.
We're all gay furries here
I'm an outlier
Why should I do it?
Because Tom said so.
Tom's dog has a number of toys
Tom's dog has a lot of toys
I enjoy what I'm doing
You can't do this now
Is Tom free?
Tom isn't in Boston any longer
What documents did you sign?
Tom said he'd be back by 2:30
Doing this isn't easy for me
Tom didn't like Mary's cooking
I'm sure Tom is upset
I'm going to hang up
What can you do well?
How much is a return ticket?
Have you got a holiday booked?
Where are you tonight?
It's a quarter past four
It's quarter past four
It's 4.15
It's inadvisable
It's not recommended
Where has my key got to again?
Where has my key gone again?
We weren't very well prepared
We weren't properly prepared
Tom said he'd ring you later
Tom said he'd phone you later
Does that help a bit?
How do you burn fat?
You're losing meat
You're losing muscle
It can't be left like that
You can't leave it like that
How to respond to an insult?
Don't let it fester inside you
It doesn't mean that you agree
Go fuck yourself!
Okay!
Go fuck yourself!
Thank you!
Do you love being insulted?
You're beautiful.
I'm having buttered toast
I'm eating buttered toast
I'm having toast with butter
I'll hang the washing out
I'm hanging the washing out
We've caught the train
You're brilliant
She's aware of it
She's aware of that
I'll manage on my own
I'm a plumber by trade
Is that a satin dress?
Yeah, I understand
I'm not a marriage counselor
Period!
Now's the time to begin
They stole Mrs. Hana's book
We've been fairly busy today
I know I can't do that
Tom isn't proud of his past
It wasn't me who said that
I can't explain how I feel
I've been hoping you'd come
Remember that he's hurt you
I'm tired of living
We don't own anything
Tom can't help us
I held Tom's hand in mine
Did Tom pay you?
Has Tom paid you already?
Has Tom already paid you?
Time's about to run out for us
What am I doing?
I don't know
Oh, is that so?
Oh, is that right?
Please do whatever's necessary
Sorry.
We're about to run out of time
The Dow is up.
I don't care about stonks.
Tom is busy, as usual
I'd rather speak to Tom first
Does Tom live close by?
I don't yet know the details
Perhaps Mary hadn't studied it
Does it rain much here?
Do we need more propane?
How much will the cruise cost?
It's cold during the winter
Are you called Tom?
Who is Hai?
Wait a second!
It wasn't this cold yesterday
I'm afraid I'm lost
When did you catch these fish?
Tom isn't a successful person
TikTok can't be contained
YouTube was activated in 2005
I'm tired of walking
Yahoo! has a cluttered look
Ziri's website was more flashy
Elephants don't climb trees
Have you tried yoga?
I've never used that shovel
I've never used a wheelbarrow
I wasn't expecting to be paid
I don't know that girl
Didn't you see Tom yesterday?
Will Tom be here tonight?
I just don't pierce anything
Why are those women crying?
Where are Ziri and Rima?
Who might replace Draghi?
China's turn is coming soon
Ziri's problem was his son
Ziri wasn't just bluffing
Ziri didn't let Rima run away
What color is the mirror?
Tom's post went viral
Guess what?
What?
That's what!
Great!
Can I get an ice cream cone?
You know you're wanted
I know you love China.
I do..
China is investing in Africa.
Honey, that's a mirror.
Ziri's whole house was empty
It's Tom
I usually don't eat fish
How's everyone back home?
I wasn't asleep at that time
I'm not a marriage counsellor
You can't bathe here
You're fanning the flames
Why do you keep going there?
How well did you know Mary?
Tom's joints hurt
Tom's joints are hurting
Tom's joints are painful
Don't swallow the pips
Is it in this street?
Have you bought the house?
Did you buy the house?
It's not easy for anyone
Don't shout in my ear
What day is Toki Pona day?
The brakes don't work either
The kitchen is south-facing
He's anything but a numpty
He's absolutely not a divvy
He's really no fool
Thank you for your commitment!
What is wrong with them?
Why are you like this?
Do not go near the beehive!
My English is so-so
It can't be described in words
My French is just so-so
Tom couldn't understand French
French isn't so difficult
French isn't very difficult
French isn't so hard
French isn't very hard
Did Tom speak in French?
Was Tom speaking in French?
Don't do it that way
Don't drink that water
Have you had your lunch?
Hot day, isn't it?
How did you like the movie?
I'm a zombie
Did Tom pay?
Has Tom paid?
Has Tom already paid?
I'm so lucky
Ziri took Rima's phone number
Ziri took Rima's number
Ziri lost Rima's number
Ziri walked out, angry
This restaurant isn't mine
It's Ziri's
Ziri's jacket is genuine
Ziri's secret was revealed
Ziri's dad was out at work
Ziri's expression changed
Ziri's house is so ugly
Ziri didn't give Rima flowers
Ziri couldn't purchase a gift
Rima was, actually, lovely
Ziri grabbed Rima's wrist
With those words, Ziri left
Ziri's phone rang again
It's Ziri's day off
Ziri doesn't have to fire Rima
She's quitting
Ziri's words were so sincere
Ziri accepted Rima's gift
How could he refuse?
Ziri was the vice-president
Ziri's job was easy
Ziri's feet were killing him
Ziri's cheeks grew red
We're losing production time
Ziri's place smelt of seafood
Ziri's boss found out
Ziri draws apes, not monkeys
Ziri's boss was a total douche
Ziri's boss wasn't very happy
Ziri won't make it to lunch
Ziri's boss panicked
That was Ziri's mistake
Ziri's computer wasn't working
Ziri couldn't believe his eyes
Ziri bought Rima's company
That's a very kind offer
Ziri's face was indescribable
Can you stop bothering us?
We're busy working!
Now, shoo!
Ziri's brother is missing
Ziri's brother is with Rima
Ziri didn't have any chores
Soon, Ziri came back from work
You're such a slacker!
No more going out!
Ziri stole Walid's girlfriend
Ziri can try his luck, too
I didn't give it much thought
A true friend wouldn't do that
Ziri won't change his mind
We'll find Rima someone soon
Is this flash drive Ziri's?
Ziri's confession shocked Rima
Ziri is ruining Rima's life
Ziri is stealing Rima's songs
Ziri's father was a tyrant
Ziri's oar broke
You're such a jerk!
Look who's talking!
Ziri went up to Rima's room
Ziri couldn't find his suit
Ziri framed Rima's picture
Ziri damaged Rima's boat
Ziri took Walid's suit
Ziri was the teacher's pet
Ziri's parents loved Rima
Ziri was reading Rima's chats
Ziri's mom has also noticed us
Ziri's parents were at home
Ziri went to Rima's house
Ziri didn't break his leg
Ziri broke Rima's leg
Ziri's son got sick
Ziri's motel grew and grew
Will China blockade Taiwan?
That's beyond my ken
That's just rude
That's just outrageous
That's just outrageous!
Stay in your place!
Where's the dressing table?
Where's my laptop?
She's a general
I hope it doesn't rain
It's a leather armchair
It's beyond my ken
How did it get in?
Don't pretend you can't hear
Don't forget your punctuation
I've got thin
I've become thin
I've slimmed down
I'm not waiting for ever
I'm not going to wait for ever
Does he have an appointment?
Has he got an appointment?
Of course, that's not the case
Where are the changing rooms?
Would you like a cough sweet?
I've got sage or lemon-flavour
It's over at last
We met in 2019
I daren't go and have a look
I daren't go and look
I daren't look
She's got one that he hasn't
She has one that he doesn't
He hasn't got them
He hasn't got it
He doesn't have them
He doesn't have it
We've got his
Sorry, I'd overlooked that
Sorry, I'd missed that
Sorry, I overlooked that
Where's the registry office?
Is it actually cheap?
But that doesn't mean anything
But that's not saying anything
I've only looked at it
I've only flicked through it
I haven't got anything left
I don't have a thing left
He doesn't represent me
He doesn't stand for me
It's minus two degrees
You just did.
I'm a huge ramen junkie
They're from Alsace
It's noon here
It's midday here
We're on our way
We'll be there in a minute
It's raining
Let's take shelter
I'll pop round later
Let's get the 4.10 train
Let's go and see for ourselves
Take your doctor's advice
Things aren't easy for anyone
No one's listening anyway
Can I ask you for a favour?
Can I ask you a favour?
I'm on top of the situation
Tom can't be here today
I'm not in a position to say
Don't tell Tom how we did this
Don't tell Tom why we did this
Don't tell Tom who did this
I'm leaving this group
I'm unsubscribing
I'm so happy I could die
Tom won't do this
Oh, it's nothing
Tom can't come now
What if Tom was lying?
Hi !
This isn't my harmonica
Tom didn't come either
Who owns this island?
I've talked to Tom before
Does Tom work as hard as Mary?
I know you don't need me here
Tom has a soft side, too
Today is lion's day
You're a cop
Don't send Tom there, please
Yes... ha ha ha... yes!
I wonder how much that'll cost
She's always got more than me
Don't forget the punctuation
Are you angry with me?
Why would I be angry with you?
Don't you wonder sometimes?
The train leaves at 2.30
The train departs at 2.30
Is that your family car?
School starts at 8.10 a.m
I'll be in touch later
He's got no sense of rhythm
He's got no rhythm
I want ice cream.
After dinner.
She doesn't mind
You're quite demanding
We're playing on the beach
Who has the keys to the flat?
How many chairs are missing?
Is that his wife?
Is Mum back yet?
We're going to the stadium
He was at the doctor's
Are there any seats available?
Were there many guests there?
Did you see that?
That's unlikely, in my opinion
To my mind, that's unlikely
I'm pregnant.
What's wrong?
I think he'll be ill
I think he'll get ill
That book's got a lot of pages
I can't hear or see anything
I'm a relative
Is that her wife?
Tom can't see well
Will you have more tea?
Is this seat occupied?
Cold day, isn't it?
Did you say anything?
I'm done, too
I'm also done
I'm done as well
I'm very glad
I can't stop trying
I'm watching Tom closely
I don't know that man
Tom couldn't solve the problem
I don't know why Tom quit
I'll let you use my tools
I do.
Tom's daughter got divorced
Were there many boys there?
Were there many people there?
Were there many women there?
I think he's going to be ill
Millie's got blue eyes
I'm on holiday here

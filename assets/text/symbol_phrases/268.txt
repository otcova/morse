It itches!
He's a different person
Do you want an apple?
What are you eating for lunch?
Does your snake bite?
Roll the die!
Want to play a game?
This soup is wonderful!
I'll count to ten
I'm plum tuckered
To hell with this beard!
I'm plum tuckered out
I'm all tuckered out
Now, let's eat
What an extensive program!
What effrontery!
Oh, dear!
What an abomination!
Go lunch with me or I'll fart
So you think you're special?
And what is the answer?
Was this the first time?
Your beard looks horrible!
Are your kids still in bed?
Don't make me sit up
Can I borrow a cup of sugar?
Could I borrow a cup of sugar?
Is this your wallet?
Is this your wallet?
Didn't you use to have a cat?
What changed her mind?
They'll change their minds
Tomorrow I'll be better
Can dogs talk?" asked Tom
I can't do it today
And so, what do you propose?
What time was it?
I'll tell you what happened
We're screwed!
Hey, Mary!
Oh, Tom has talent
Mary's eyes widened
Can you understand that?
No, I can't.
We celebrated Tom's birthday
I've never fainted before
Are you all right?
Yeah, l'm fine.
Tom hasn't changed at all
Mary hasn't changed at all
He hasn't changed at all
She hasn't changed at all
You and Tom are so cute!
It was your idea.
I know.
Tom took about 15 selfies
Mary kissed Tom's cheek
Do you like winter?
The blonde's name is Mary
Don't forget.
I won't.
What do you mean?
My husband?
Your red sweater!
What is Mary afraid of?
Do you like him?
No.
Why are you blushing then?
Tom's parents are strict
Mary has long, shiny hair
Tom has a six-pack
I'm so glad I did this
I'm so glad we did this
Do you like him?
No.
Then why are you blushing?
The brunette's name is Mary
Mary has salt-and-pepper hair
We had the Christkind.
Why can't I go to the party?
I can't move my fingers
Suddenly, they were making out
Wear flat, rubber-soled shoes
Keep your distance!
Don't feed wildlife
Step #1: Buy a puppy
Step #2: Buy a stethoscope
Tom wore an oversized T-shirt
Mary wore an oversized T-shirt
What?
Really?
Has anything escaped me?
Tom's heart started racing
Mary's heart started racing
“You saw this?”
“As clearly as I see you.”
“In spirit?”
“Exactly
“Baskerville Hall,” said he
Welcome, Sir Henry!
Welcome to Baskerville Hall!
“My wife is expecting me.”
He's quitting
He's an eager beaver
This is Tom's signature dish
There wasn't a soul there
We're getting cheeseburgers
Tom, come inside!
I've made your favorite meal
It's going to get cold soon.
Please come tomorrow!
I'm very busy today
Come tomorrow!
Come tomorrow!
Guess where I've been!
Dear friends!
Let's go kayaking
Protein-style means no bun
You don't have the balls
Look, there's my friend
This bag's heavy
His mother's at home
He's at school
My sister's a nurse
He's sick
He's in bed
He's a very old man
He's ninety-eight years old
You're late. — No, I'm not!
I'm early
She isn't home
She's at work
My name's Alan
I'm from New York
I'm twenty years old
It isn't windy today
I'm not feeling right
He's a good swimmer
My name's Amanda
No, I'm single
Yes, I am
No, you're on time
No, she's out
Are your parents at home?
No, they're out
Is it cold in your room?
Yes, a little
Are they new?
Yes, they are
Where's your mother?
Is she at home?
That's not a dance move
How much are they?
They're a dollar
They're a buck
They're a pound
They're a euro
This hotel isn't very good
Why is it so expensive?
He's the boss
He's doing great
No, but I'm thirsty
Is your friend Chinese?
Yes, he is
I've enjoyed my stay here
I'll be sorry to leave
Let's get something to drink
What color are your new shoes?
We're having dinner now
Can I call you later?
We're here on vacation
No, it isn't
Where's the camera?
No, it's black
Is Lisa from Toronto?
Lead the charge!
No, she's American
Yes, you are
Where's Layla from?
She's from London
What color is your bag?
It's black
No, I'm not
How's John?
Is your job interesting?

How much are these oranges?
They're 2.3 Euros a kilo
Who's the man in this photo?
They're black
I'm Brian
Are you Australian?
No, I'm Canadian
I'm thirty-three
No, I'm a doctor
Is your wife a doctor?
No, she's a teacher
Where is she from?
She's from Mexico
She's twenty-six (26)
Are you married? — No, I'm not
Are you thirsty? — Yes, I am
Is it dark now?
Yes, it is.
Are you a teacher? — Yes, I am
I'm working
I'm not watching TV
She isn't eating
The weather's nice
It's not raining
I'm not watching TV
He's waiting for a bus
He's lying on the floor
We're eating breakfast
She's sitting on the table
He's in the kitchen
He's cooking
I'm leaving now, goodbye
She isn't having dinner
She's watching TV
She's sitting on the floor
He's not playing the piano
He's laughing
He's not writing a letter
I'm not washing my hair
I'm not eating
I'm not studying English
The sun isn't shining
I'm wearing my shoes
I'm not reading the newspaper
Are you feeling okay?
Yes, I'm fine
Yes, take an umbrella
Why are you wearing a coat?
What's he doing?
He's reading the newspaper
They're watching TV
Are you waiting for John?
Is Chris working today?
No, he isn't
Is the sun shining?
Yes, it is
No, they're staying with me
No, you can turn it off
Yes, see you tomorrow
No, not right now
Are you enjoying the movie?
Yes, it's very funny
Does the clock work?
No, it's broken
Are you waiting for a bus?
No, I'm waiting for a taxi
Why is he laughing?
Are your parents watching TV?
What's Claire cooking?
Is the bus coming?
Is he eating something?
Are you sitting on the floor?
When is something art?
I'm hearing voices," said Tom
He's a genius
Why so cynical?
No microwave popcorn, please!
Pathetic!
Interrogate!
Where is the person?
How's your sex life?
Do you want to stay?
Here's to our friendship
Do you have a food allergy?
Mary gently punched Tom's arm
I don't really have a plan
Tom only buys free-range eggs
Come, I'll show you
There's been times
No more, please
I'm a human who hates humans
I didn't know that was a thing
Be alert!
I'm not going there
That's all of them
He's been reborn
Tom's family was there, too
It's in the shop
What was your card?
It's magnetic
I've had a premature child
How is school going?
Why can't I come in the party?
I'm looking after children
I'm babysitting
Who sold you such an ugly car?
Did they take my car?
Where did you leave the car?
They broke the car's window
Can you pick me up?
What is this used for?
Tom: "Fuck you!
That's a bargain
Take the jump shot!
Do you want to help me here?
He's back
I can't think
“Go back!” she said
He's a tugboat captain
Why do I exist?
You can't go back
Don't defeat yourself
It'll be alright
I don't like bananas
They're too sweet
We've hit our sales target
Now what?
As you were saying?
Which one is faster?
Sorry, I was talking to myself
He's working in Paris now
She'll have him all to herself
He's exhausted
What are the chances?
He's got a lot of strength
You're staring
Tom's mother hugged him
No," answered the cat
Don't act so shocked
I'm not sorry that I did this
What more is there?
I'm a year younger than Robert
I can't talk to women
Whose is all this money?
I'm thinking about life
What's wrong with beans?
A pine cone fell on Tom's head
Humans aren't all bad
Is there hope for humanity?
I don't feel like sleeping
Ding dong, is anybody home?
Time's up
Which sandwich is yours?
He's exhausted himself
This can of beans," said Mary
Is the movie available online?
Who stars in it?
I don't like that genre
What did the critics say?
I don't agree with the critics
That's a horrible song
Ah, that's better
More coffee?
Sugar?
No, thanks
I don't eat toxic substances.
Do you want half and half?
Do you want cream?
Does this car have an airbag?
Does this car have seat belts?
It's a short flight
Can I see the menu?
Oh, yeah?" said Tom
Run!
It's hailing!
I can't read the menu
Can you spot me?
Do you lift?
Don't forget your water bottle
Do you hike?
First time to California?
What's in the thermos?
Tea.
Let's drive to Vegas on Friday
I hope you don't mind.
Not at all.
I'm not naive
I'm just optimistic
Don't over season the food
More seasoning?
We're not teenagers anymore
Thanks, Tom
Is obsession bad?" asked Tom
Wow, loaded question
Is there an answer?" said Mary
Why am I here?" asked Tom
Everyone thinks she's nice
Alright already!
This time we'll win!
What's on the playlist?
What is the batch size?
Buckle up!
Nice shoes.
Thanks, I just got them.
Do you have a beach ball?
OK?" said Tom
Probably, I guess
I dunno," said Tom
The cat's in heat
Ahoy!
Can you see us in this fog?
Land ho!
Batten down the hatches!
We're at an impasse
Stick your hands up!
I'll call the pharmacy
It's time to milk the goats
What's wrong?
Are you sad about something?
What's Tom's dream school?
I'm shaking
Hello, Tom?
I'm badly shaken
I'll help you carry that
What a gaffe!
Flowers?
For me?
You shouldn't have
Well, I do declare!
He's a bandit alright
They're from the same litter
What do you reckon?
He's not a good navigator
He shouldn't be allowed out
I'm just sayin'
He's not very talkative
What is your hobby?
Did you try rebooting?
Why did she say that?
He's not the only one
They're all con men
Where is your backpack?
It's rotten inside
Can I hold your puppy?
Help!
I've been robbed!
I've been stabbed!
Call for help!
I'm bleeding!
I've been shot!
They're shooting at us
Quick!
I can't follow the plot
Calling all cars!
Slow down!
Oh, lord
There's been a terrible crash
She's fractured her leg
It's frozen shut
I can't feel my feet
Is this how it ends?
Hypothermia?
Can you start a fire?
I can't move my fingers
They're frostbitten
He's lost
He's fallen off the cliff
I can't pay bribes
He's more fit than we expected
Don't hike in sneakers
You're all red
You'll get a sunstroke
There's a huge bruise
Are you OK?
Is this cup clean?
Are the dishes done?
I can't say it
See this?
Cool song, bro
These shorts don't fit anymore
They're all on drugs
Why didn't you shave?
I'm getting sick
He's got a knife!
Where's the water filter?
That's his expertise
Can you navigate by starlight?
Did you pack a first aid kit?
I'm getting no reception here
Do you know how to tie knots?
Where are your morals?
I'll prepare the chicken
Don't pick at your scabs
Don't eat your scabs
Cover me!
I've booked a small cabin
Can you paddle a canoe?
Can you decrypt this?
There's a secret clue here
I'm an urologist
Careful!
That's a priceless fossil
It's leg day
Don't skip leg day
Look who's talking!
Do you know who's behind you?
Guess who's behind you
Tom has a girlfriend?
Mary has a boyfriend?
Would you like a salad?
Who are you texting?
Who are you texting?
That's none of your business.
When's the next shuttle?
Do you have the bus schedule?
He's on his way over there
I'm taking therapy for my hip
I'll be in my man cave
Halt!
Who goes there!
Queer all languages!
They're courageous
23 skidoo!
22 skidoo!
Such harsh words!
All power to the syndicates!
He's built like a fencepost
Tell me straight, now!
Tell me straight, now!
What has he against me?
What has he against me?
What has she against me?
I'm glad we're finally home
Mary's heart nearly stopped
Tom's heart nearly stopped
She still hasn't forgiven me
“Nothing, sir.”
What are you doing here, Tom?
Nothing.
Come, now!
No lies!
I never should have left you.
But you did.
Tom still hasn't forgiven Mary
You didn't know?
Where do you go to smoke?
That’s not entirely stupid
Why don’t you write a book?
Feel my hand!”
This must be Tom's cat
Oh, look!
There's something shiny
Mary bandaged Tom's arm
He's right behind you!
She's right behind you!
Watch out!
He's right behind you!
Give it to me.
No!
Her initials are L. L
What is it that alarms you?
You knew him, did you not?
Did you correspond with him?
“Then I answer—certainly not.”
“I never went.”
“What was that?”
“That is a private matter
I cannot tell it.”
It's safe now
Besides lazy, they are liars
How much is the newspaper?
Tom's stomach lurched
That's not her husband
That's not his wife
You’ve seen too many movies
Tom, this is important
But why keep me in the dark?
Good heavens, Holmes!
Are you sure of what you say?
“Oh, my God!”
“What is it?
What does it mean?”
He has beaten us, Watson
“He has beaten us, Watson
We are too late.”
“No, no, surely not!”
“Good heavens!”
I cried, in amazement
“My God!” he whispered
“What was it?
It’s dead, whatever it was
“Footprints?”
“Footprints.”
“A man’s or a woman’s?”
Why isn't Mary here?
What is it, then — a fire?
No; a client
What, then?
It is fear, Mr. Holmes
It is terror.
Farintosh," said he
Your sister is dead, then?
Always.
And why?
Helen!
It was the band!
The speckled band!'
Was your sister dressed?
We don't keep a cat
I shall most certainly do so.
Good-bye and be brave
Salad again?
Can I borrow your puppy?
Tom's mother is Canadian
I'm in the school play
You insensitive prick!
How about we order pizza?
How about we order pizza?
That's a great idea
How beautiful she was!
How beautiful she was!
And yet how aloof!
What a pity to spoil it!
Is it my appearance, or what?
I'm in love with somebody else
What does he look like?
I'd have done it to please you
I did.
You never said so.
What a prosaic motive!
I'll see you on Tuesday
What does she look like?
He's my friend
She's my friend
It was a five-alarm fire
And so I said T.M.I., Tom
Mary's sister is a total bitch
Should I eat it?
Have you had dinner yet?
He's a nervous pee-er
Where's your other shoe?
What a bunch of pricks!
Did you fart on my salad?
Have you heard the gossip?
I'll have the crab
Pardon me!
Oh no, I remember
He's naturally hairy
He's wearing his mask
Don't wake us up
I'm out of underwear
She can't stop crying
Will you remember me?
Let's get it
Let's ask for it
You're very short
What day is today?
Is that your answer?
Is it next to the door?
I'm behind you
He's from a small town
He's not from a big city
She's in front of me
Who's that person?
Is it an important job?
Is it near his house?
Is his job interesting?
Is his company important?
That's a short report
My address isn't on your list
Who's she with?
He's an important director
Who's in that car?
He's a big deal
I just knew it!
What jerks!
He's in that room
Where's the email?
It's not on the wall
Where is it then?
Is his wife happy in New York?
Is this the last page?
Your fax wasn't received
Is the book in your briefcase?
Who's my teacher?
Your problem isn't important
Who's this box for?
Company's CEO visits us
Are these exercises difficult?
Where do you have your pencil?
Where are his?
Whose pictures are those?
Whose are they then?
They're at home now
Step in here, sir
Don't wait to argue with him
This is your problem, not mine
Are these magazines his?
The ship's in the port
He's an artist
The university's near here
What's all this?
What kind of watch is that?
You've finished my patience
It's not a secret," she cried
What colour are those walls?
When are the meetings?
They're not in that meeting
Why are you with them?
The water's very hot
Would you kindly look at this?
It's a very hot day
What's their answer?
What are the real figures?
Why are the people angry?
It's your life
And then what?
Where are your son's toys?
You did that on purpose.
I did not!
What will we do now?
Can I borrow your notes?
I'm not leaving him behind
I'm not leaving her behind
I'm not leaving you behind
Where's the lawyer's money?
It's not enough space
I'm not going to Tom's house
I'm not going to Tom's place
I'll put this away
Do you want to sign?
I couldn't ask you
And I may come?
I'll have the prime rib dinner
It took about 15 minutes
Is this seat taken?
Pull over!
You are a beautiful woman!
Tom said Mary wasn't skeptical
I'll marry her
He's his friend
Do you like peas?
Excuse me, but I'm lying
This wasn't the first time
Where's the proof of that?
You mean Player2?" said Tom,
Why certainly!
Yuk, yuk
Hey!
Wait a minute!
I'm heading to the gym
How can I be freezing?
Is the Holocaust a hoax?
It's soft to the touch
I'm being railroaded
Why the inquision?
What do you hope to prove?
OK, hop to it
You'll burn out the clutch
It's slimming
He's a fidgeter
Why are you sweating so much?
I am going to fart," said Tom
Who is the son of Mary?
Are you kidding me?
Dang it!
Sincerely, the rest of us
I can't wait for this
I'm happy about this
I'm very happy about this
She couldn't look away
He couldn't look away
So, how did I do?
Are you going to the gala?
There's a hole in your jeans.
Yeah, I know
I bought them like that.
Mary wore a boyfriend T-shirt
Are you traveling alone?
Will you come to the meeting?
Do you have a problem with it?
Did you know about this?
About what?
Where are all the scarfs?
She's had a long day
I'm drinking too much coffee
Let's play a board game
Where can I buy organic eggs?
I'm from upper state New York
She's a gold digger
Do you know the lyrics?
Let's sing!
Let us sing!
You'll be taking a nap
She's a crazy witch
Is this game cross-platform?
It's not bedtime yet
What did you discover?
He can't seem to relax
Behold!
What did you wear last night?
This is your son, Mary!
Jesus is your son, Mary!
Hail Mary, full of grace
Can you keep me company?
It's a toxic environment
I'm hungry again
Brace yourself!
I don't like mussels
She's crippled now
Wow!
You've lost a lot of weight
We won't be gone long
I haven't been out in ages
I haven't been out for ages
I didn't mean it like that
How about we get out of here?
It's day already
Where is the other screw?
I'm cured!
It's the inverse
What are they fighting about?
You're blocking the view
Hear, O Israel
Tom, this is serious!
Hey, you two, get a room!
Tom's story had a happy ending
Tom pushed Mary's hand away
Mary pushed Tom's hand away
Tom!
How could you?
I can't fathom it
Tom's solo was awesome
You've got to teach me
Tom's parents were very strict
Tom's parents are very strict
Mary's parents are very strict
Tom found $5 in the dryer
Feminism is wonderful!
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Thy kingdom come!
Do you want a hot dog?
I don't like those shoes
She's in a deep sleep
Move a little!
Why do jews hate gentiles?
Thank you!
Can you count the stars?
I'll make a spinach salad
Oh, yeah
Do you think she'll agree?
Do you think he'll agree?
Don't worry
You'll make a fine father
Don't you read the papers?
Don't worry
Don't worry
You'll be fine
Don't you threaten me!
Don't worry
What happened?
Why are you crying?
That's not what I ordered
Mary's face brightened
I'm making spaghetti sauce
I'm not a firm believer
It wasn't part of the plan
What are you having?
What are you having?
A shiver ran down Tom's spine
What did you cook?
I want to fight!
Do you see the man's horse?
Don't fish in this river
I think I heard a baby's cry
These are James's glasses
You shouldn't be so rude
Tom wasn't in school today
What is the incubation period?
I'm a big coffee drinker
When do you leave?
What time are you getting up?
Hail, Queen, mother of mercy
He hasn't called yet
Is that what she told you?
Is that what he told you?
Don't worry
Why are you so reluctant?
Don't be ignorant
I've had my fill
Tom teaches music part-time
Oh, I just remembered
Oh, I just remembered
I'm getting tired of waiting
Who's with you?
Who'll help you?
These aren't mine
These aren't ours
Is tomorrow Monday?
Will Tom live?
I'm called Tom
It's not Tom's
Is that your son?
That's a big dog
I'll come get you
I'll go on Monday
I'm busy on Monday
What's Tom job?
I'm free on Monday
Why didn't you eat?
You should go, too
Let's meet on Monday
We'll meet on Monday
You're not like them
I'll meet you tonight
That's Tom's dog
Is that your daughter?
That's not Tom's
This isn't Tom's
Tom didn't react
Tom is debt-free
I'll call you sometime
What about next Monday?
We're Tom's sons
You cheated, didn't you?
Mary is my mother-in-law
Is there something happening?
May I sit with you?
I'll send you a copy
I'll come pick you up
I'll meet you at 2:30
We've located Tom
What else will you do?
Where's Tom's dog?
When did you buy this?
Which one's Tom's?
Why do women hate you?
That's still Tom's
These aren't Tom's
I'll let you handle it
Tom isn't handsome
This isn't what I need
This isn't what I want
When did you make this?
Tom is quick-witted
Why don't you eat beef?
Why don't you eat pork?
I'll cut you some slack
I'm faster than you are
Tell me why you're here
Tom should've waited
We're Tom's children
That's Tom's suitcase
When did you paint this?
When did you write this?
Who'll help you do that?
We're Tom's daughters
I won't come before 2:30
I'll be free next Monday
That's Tom's girlfriend
I'm quicker than you are
What's Tom's occupation?
Who let Tom in?
What'll you do on Monday?
Why is Tom sad?
I hate Tom, too
Let's eat out next Monday
I'm sick of Tom
I hate Tom's hat
I like Tom's cat
I love Tom's son
I've tried doing that before
Let's get together on Monday
Is that dog Tom's?
Mary is a fine-looking woman
I'm more confused than before
I love Tom's idea
I waxed Tom's car
Tom's waiting for you
You can't be older than me
You can't be older than I am
Why do you think Tom is right?
What is Tom's last name?
What sort of person is Tom?
What do you plan to do next?
What did you go to Boston for?
What are you doing Monday?
What are you doing on Monday?
We're going to the beach
Tomorrow I'm going to Boston
Tom wouldn't let Mary hug him
Tom wouldn't let Mary help him
Tom weighs about 80 kilos
Tom weighs about 80 kilograms
Tom told me you're unreliable
Tom told me you're famous
Tom told me you'd win
Tom told me you'd done that
Tom told me you'd do that
Tom told me we're out of time
Tom told me Mary wasn't upset
Tom told me Mary wasn't tired
Tom told me Mary wasn't sleepy
Tom told me Mary wasn't shy
Tom told me Mary wasn't scared
Tom told me Mary wasn't ready
Tom told me Mary wasn't lonely
Tom told me Mary wasn't afraid
Tom told me it's impossible
Tom told me I'm slow
Tom told me I'm safe
Tom told me I'm right
Tom told me I'm pushy

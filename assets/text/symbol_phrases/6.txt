Nothing's happening here
Nothing's going on here
There's no great hurry
It's been raining a lot lately
Bet that's not true
Is there snow where you are?
Any news?
No, same as usual.
Any news?
I'll be straight back
I'll be back in a jiffy
It wasn't meant like that
It's no longer the way it was
He's a good self-publicist
Could you pass me the sugar?
He took over his father's firm
Isn't it dangerous there?
Who'll come next?
Tom isn't on the dock
Let's not run away

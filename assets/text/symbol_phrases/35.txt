It's a complete waste of time
We don't need eyewitnesses
He's a decent person by nature
When will you go to São Paulo?
You speak such good German!
Oh, no, not at all
I still have a lot to learn.
Would you teach me that?
Would you teach that to me?
He's not looking for trouble
Are you there, love?
I'd like to record my record
I've started drinking again
There wasn't much rain
I've always loved rain
It is how it is.
But it could be otherwise!
It's supposed to rain all week
It didn't rain last week
We've finally gotten some rain
Time for dinner!
What's on your wish list?
I wish that weren't true
I wish I'd said that
I don't wish to intrude
I wish I'd been wrong
I wish I weren't so old
Really?
He's quite the troublemaker
Here, a slight smile
I'm going prepare dinner
He's a great professor
Do I really woke up?
Jealous of what exactly?
I wish you wouldn't smoke
I wish you'd do me a favor
Who is the femboy?
Are you a femboy chatbot?
No, you are not
No, you aren't
I wish you'd behave yourself
He's my superior
He's responsible for me
What is up with everyone?
Daniel is from Bejaia, Algeria
How does this sound to you?
This isn't in the script
Click "OK
When will it snow?
He's in the mountains
She's in the mountains
They're in the mountains
David didn't talk to Dad
I don't have any money.
Don't worry
It's my treat.
I can't decide for you
David doesn't shower with us
Don't go out in the rain
You'll catch a cold
It's a sleight of hand
They're never direct
You're an exception
He's by nature a good man
It's just pointless
Are you still studying math?
Are you still studying maths?
She's no hero
You're dehydrated
I'm a dork
Don't do that now
I don't want to destroy
The rain didn't come
Don't you feel well?
She's married and has a child
Do you want dinner?
Or a bath?
Or maybe you want me?
Where are the bargain bins?
That's it in a nutshell
I can't leave
It's not so easily done
Tom's absent, as he has a cold
Where's my scarf?
Have you seen it?
How can you blame me?
Will you ever shut up?
Your patriotism is screwed up!
That's just another lie
That was a flat-out lie
Don't let fear control you
Don't rely on this
It's better to switch course
You can't justify it like that
Are you afraid of change?
We're outnumbered by insects
Caterpillars eat 24/7
Will you come tonight?
Soon, David came back home
David's mom is sick, too
David's heart rate dropped
Soon, the school reopened
David is a ladies' man
David joined them, too
David's pups were born
David's puppies are OK
David's puppies are alright
David's father visited
Why doesn't David just leave?
David wasn't able to say no
Close your mouth to eat!
A child can't be transgender.
I'm completely out of tune
I'm afraid of being alone
That's just how it feels
I believe in you !
He's an overly critical person
He's clearly a violent person
Are you still at Harvard?
Snitches get stitches.
Is that a threat?
It's a statement of fact.
I'm neck-deep in debt
I'm in debt up to my neck
It's just a sentence
We're the funniest monkeys
Beg me to eat!
Do you have low self-esteem?
Don't give up on yourself
How was your season?
Did you score any baskets?
Because I didn't feel like it.
Are you still hung up on that?
I said I'm sorry!
How's my coochy coo?
How's my coochy coo bunny?
Don't cry, my coochy coo bunny
This made David's blood boil
David isn't into Amanda either
David knows he's talented
I'm gonna tell my...
Dad?
I know.
You're on!
Mold appeared in David's house
David's house stands on a hill
David nodded, scared
You can't touch it
Did you just call me a ninny?
David can't stand garlic
David doesn't have neighbors
The West can't beat Russia
David's dad was dating someone
Take the dog away!
I'm afraid of dogs!
He doesn't stand a chance
David won't follow us
You won't ruin my evening
David won't have to wait long
David wasn't surprised anymore
David didn't even deny that
David's brakes weren't working
What's wrong?
David's account was blocked
David wasn't a good student
Now, go
David is stupid.
That's for sure.
Did you take it?
They should be here, too
David had a sense of dejà-vu
David bandaged the dog's paw
David didn't seem to notice
Are you up for a swim?
Don't start scolding me now
David's final look was amazing
David wasn't welcome there
David blocked Amanda's way
David didn't talk much
David pierced Amanda's nose
David had to leave the cafe/
David didn't even answer
David didn't lock Amanda up
David was Amanda's idol
David will be Amanda's teacher
Here, ladies wear dresses
Let's get on with practice
David became world-famous
Don't mutilate children
David doesn't have a will
David hasn't found a job yet
Please don't get into a fight
You're all gross!
James's life was very boring
James was a right-wing zealot
Who's going to feed him?
He's psychologically unstable
Don't mutilate kids
Where's he going?
You're not Spaniards
Will you see the movie?
Have you warned Tom?
I don't care where Tom went
I had a feeling you'd say yes
I'm not sure what caused this
I started, but I didn't finish
Trains don't go there
Thus, he made a lot of money
Let's go and have a cuppa
Has our schedule changed?
How about you?
Will you knit me a jumper?
Correctamundo!
There's Tom at the back
He's waving
Can't he just leave us alone?
Oh, that doesn't look good!
I've eaten a lot today
I've had a lot to eat today
He didn't mean that seriously
Let's meet on Saturday!
That's blooming expensive!
Don't you need these photos?
Do you not need these photos?
Have you moved it?
Are all these your papers?
She's trying to say something
My mum'll be proud of me
We didn't wait for you
How can this be explained?
Are a lot of guests coming?
When are you going on holiday?
It's not that cold yet
It isn't that cold yet
It's not cold yet
It isn't cold yet
There's a bottle on the table
I've corrected everything
What's going on today?
Was he wrong?
No, he was right.
I'm French.
I couldn't sit through it
He'd rather go on Friday
Don't sell that
I don't plan to sell it
Where do they sell stamps?
Does that store sell bread?
Tooth hurty.
That's just a flat-out lie
That's no reason to lie
Maybe I'll lie down
I can't live with this lie
Right now, I need to lie down
Tom don't usually lie to me
Are you asking me to lie?
I believe that's a lie
I can't lie to my parents
That's a lie, and you know it
James is not Amanda's equal
James wasn't online
You're not my type
James wasn't spoilt at all
James headed to Amanda's place
James blocked Amanda's number
James?
James's usual life change
Were they flirting?
I'll ask if that's possible
Did he just call me ugly?
James walked to Amanda's table
James doesn't need any diets
James shouted: "Surprise!
What does this theorem prove?
Can I get another gift?
Of course, honey!
Close your mouth!
James's driver was super late
James's heart was pounding
What are you paying James for?
James's driver finally arrived
James saw Amanda, too
Someone shouted "cops.
James has taken the money, too
James didn't hide there
James's home was tiny
James's head was spinning
James wouldn't let Amanda go
James knew Amanda's reputation
Is James still at the table?
Will you marry me?
Yes!
A million times yes!
That's how James got injured
James.
What an arrogant jerk!
I only love you.
Liar!
James's story was inspiring
James's blood ran cold
James's burger tasted awful
James clipped Amanda's wings
James?
I don't know what came over me
James came to Amanda, smiling
James's company didn't exist
Don't stand in James's way
Why are James's eyes blue?
James hasn't spioken a word
Will you stop being a baby?
I'm eating my lunch
Can't you see?
I'm in love with you, silly!
James's parents were away
Did you follow me here?
Yes, and good thing I did.
James's parents deserve this
Let's just go home and talk
Do you think James is OK?
James is almost a grown-up
Just come home, please!
I didn't go with Tom today
Can you grate bread?
Tom's parents split up
Tom's parents have split up
Why can't you call Tom?
Why can't you help Tom?
Why can't you tell Tom?
Why can't you do that Tom?
Didn't Tom show up?
I didn't tell Tom or Mary
I don't know what Tom is up to
I thought Tom wouldn't hear us
I thought Tom wouldn't see us
That's too much for me
That's not enough for me
Tom didn't eat what was served
We're just barely surviving
Mary is Tom's current wife
A.I. won't reach singularity
I'm starting Project 2501
How do you calculate pi?
Let's meet on Saturday
They're not opening up.
Ring the doorbell again.
I don’t wear any
What's on the box?
I started but didn't finish
What's for dinner tonight?
What kind of fish is that?
Can you do me a quick favor?
Sure, what do you need?
Can you grab my keys for me?
I just love plants!
It looks so nice!
You want to make a quick buck?
Can I smoke?
Can I smoke a cigarette?
I'll be along shortly
Coming!
Here I come!
Is there any butter in it?
What a puzzle!
You are ridiculous!
Do you have Skype?
Can I clean up somewhere?
Have you sent her my message?
May I lend your car?
What a bastard!
What a sucker!
What a dumbass!
I like apples, too
It doesn't sit well with Tom
I've lost interest in you
You don't matter to me anymore
We're the only two here
You won't be able to seduce me
It's no use stamping your feet
He's everything to me
There's no need to bring lunch
Are you always home at night?
Haven't you brought anything?
We deliver within 24 hours
We'll all live together
Take it back to him!
What an impressive start!
Quite an impressive start!
She doesn't talk
They're chatting
He's talking about me
What is a trade?
What is a craft?
We'll stay in bed all morning
He's not receiving the guests
My apologies, I had to ask
Bring it to me!
You're shaving me now
How do you perceive me?
Oh, that's a shame!
But why are you doing that?
Tom really liked Mary's idea
He's sexually attracted to me
Tahmid didn’t say anything
Like hell it is!
James doesn't sing that way
James's eyes widened
James can't help but listen
I'll see you when you get home
I'll see you tomorrow.
You know it.
James doesn't look so good
James's vocals were so clear
I..
I like you.
Really?
Really.
Suddenly, James heard sirens
James didn't pay taxes
Let's go get James a nice gift
James was a well-built man
James has 499 days left
James didn't stand a chance
I don't mind being alone
I'm OK with being alone
I can't just stand still
James hasn't changed at all
James didn't like that one bit
James said that, sobbing
James's surgery went well
James's dad left last night
James doesn't think so
James's predictions came true
James wasn't going to win
He was crying, too
How could James be so cruel?
James's room was eerily quiet
James's lawyer called
If anything, this is shameful
James called out Amanda's name
James didn't realize the trick
James ran to Amanda's rescue
Your eyeliner looks very good!
Oh my gosh, I won!
Where's the stuff?
Where's the other stuff?
Let me see the stuff.
Let me see the money.
No oyster sauce, please
Did you like city life?
You really study hard!
Don't touch my toys
Can I play with your toys?
Can I play with your toys?
Those ones are new.
She hasn't lost the game yet
Check this one out!
Look at this one!
Why are you yawning so much?
Are you sleepy?
You'd better start right away
It's in the past
To be honest, I love myself
We are ready!
We're done!
Beat it, asshole!
She's in trouble!
Go on, Thomas
Do you also collect coins?
Go where glory waits thee!
Who is calling you?
This is getting out of hand!
It's completely dark outside
I wish I'd done what Tom did
Are you all right or not?
It is true, it is not a joke
Tom swore that he'd do that
Tom's room was clean
You've got to come clean
Are these plates clean?
How did you clean that?
It's a pretty clean river
This blanket isn't clean
Algiers?
That's too expensive
We can't pay for that
John stole Jessica's wallet
John was Samuel's alter ego
John fought with Jessica's mom
Come visit me in Algiers.
Algiers?
I would love that!
John didn't see Jessica there
John's parents just moved here
Can I touch?
Sure!
Says the nerd.
We're leaving this silly house
I'm really sorry for...
Do you need help?
Go away!
John isn't a thief.
Exactly.
John's sneezing subsided
Why is John allergic to paper?
Can you hear it?
That's my heart pounding
Something wasn't adding up
John's parents were scientists
You scared us, moron!
Are you having a party?
Can I join you?
Can I stay?
OK, but don't touch anything.
John's legs gave way
Why did the parrot say that?
You were too controlling.
How dare you say that?
It was Jessica's
John's rival was eliminated
You're back?
How did you manage it?
John didn't respect anyone
There's no privacy any more
I'm going make dinner
John didn't pay rent on time
Is this my new room?
John didn't want to believe it
John shouldn't have done that
He thinks he's so important
I've got a bit of a cold today
This isn't always true
They're coming back now
I think he's really nice
I think it's really nice
What does your illness do?
I'll go and see who's there
That's all I've got on me
That's all I have with me
Now I'll tell you what I'll do
I've come," said Jude
You?
Who are you?
Oh yes—to be sure!
Got any orders, lad?
Yes.
What about them?
Ah, yes, yes!
Forgot all about it—all!
Thanks!
I'll remember that
Where's autumn?
He thinks he's an expert
Aren't you listening to me?
Can you switch the telly off?
Where are the nukes?
He's not a vegan anymore
When will Tom visit us again?
How dare you even talk to me?
I'm delighted to hear the news
We'll take care of you later
You are so un-Japanese!
I'm exhausted and need to rest
He is a sick, poor man
You're really strong
I can’t hide my misery
What happened at home?
It's wonderful to be home
Attention!
He's a famous poet from Persia
Would you confirm that?
You don't have nightmares
Leave it there!
She's in Paris
Have a wonderful celebration!
Last year, I had a stroke
There's no more peach juice
I can barely pay my bills!
I can scarcely pay my bills!
He's indeed sleeping
I'm drooling
It hasn't stopped snowing
Weren't you about to leave?
Are they on sale?
The picture isn't sharp enough
The man's a genius
How does one make bread?
What makes you so miserable?
Healthy body, healthy mind
Please show me how it's done
They're ahead of us
When do you plan to get back?
Are you guys far away?
You learned a lot, didn't you?
Are you Elena's friends?
Keep talking!
Don't stop talking!
Why didn't you join us?
She's calling Jacques
Go ahead and climb on up!
Do you feel crazy?
Are you feeling crazy?
It's hard being honest
I'm worrying!
She doesn't respect anything
What do you have to say now?
Quit being so selfish!
She's sitting on the chair
I, too, need to remain calm
Forget about that right now!
He has a drug-addicted son
He's an extremely messy person
Let's stay up all night
He's skilled at his profession
Let's stay up till dawn
Let's study all night
Let's work all night
You've stooped so low!
You've piqued my curiosity
He's starting to feel down
I've never been lucky in life
The dead can't be resurrected
He's obsessed with order
Do all dragons have wings?
It's getting higher and higher
I am your ally, trust me
Simply put, you're a failure
They didn't obey
Yes, and that's bad.
I don't care about trends
He's always on the defensive
He's an expert at what he does
I didn't get even one vote
What was the court's decision?
Tom, where's my car?
How's John?
That's what I'd like to know.
Did that medicine help you?
I'm going for a smoke.
But you don't smoke.
Come on, love
We're going home now.
Yes, Mum.
I'll arrive at midday tomorrow
Did you all work together?
He's a world citizen
I'm waiting for a bus
Who's visiting us today?
Turn the music down!
No, I haven't told anyone.
Do you think about her often?
See you tonight!
Until then!
How many days are in a year?
He said that too?
She said that too?
Damned if I know!
Did Greece ever have a king?
They're now a steady couple
I'll add it to my reading list
I've long given up on politics
I'm looking for the best deal
I don't think there's a deity
Is there a French translation?
What does violence mean?
Is it in stock?
You've always been a bad liar
That's fifty yen
I'm hungry after having sex
Compromises don't appeal to me
For spite, he broke my glasses
Tom's sister is a nurse
I'm a Martian
He's very popular
It's complicated, right?
They don't see him
Is there subway in your city?
He enjoys the girls' favour
They've always been like that
What floor are you on?
We're all spread out
They're ugly as hatchlings
They've been proven guilty
I can't free myself from it
What kind of fish was it?
Is everyone interested?
Does anybody else feel cold?
Isn't that a sentence?
I'll take one of each
I don't think it's feasible
Most snakes aren't poisonous
That wasn't a poem
My monitor isn't capable of 4K
It's feeding time
But isn't it true?
Let's have some pudding
Tom, you're the last one out
Do birds watch us?
Tom's got a terrible cough
Tom doesn't tell a lot of lies
Is it possible I'm not wrong?
Tom's new cat loves me
I've never believed in destiny
I'm hungry and lonely
Tom wouldn't drive a hybrid
I couldn't separate the two
I didn't go see Tom's band
I'll bet you Tom gets delayed
Has Tom gone mute?
We need high-speed rail here
Tom isn't a real lawyer
They'll never hear me
That's not how it works!
That's exactly how it works.
Tom isn't in his prime
Do you guys want watermelon?
Tom's dad is the custodian
I doubt Tom is a ghost, John
We're on strike!
We don't have enough for more
Do you speak Haitian Creole?
I'm allergic to stupid people
Nobles are born, not made
Has she always been like that?
She wasn't always like that
Has he always been like that?
Capitalists are right-wing
I've got a lot of friends.
Tom isn't hungry right now
Can you throw out the soup?
Who called them in?
How big is this place?!
What a cute puppy!
I can't watch helplessly
I can't make a decision now
I can't decide on the spot
Does it make me look fat?
It's not worth that much
I'll be asleep by then
Could you put it on the table?
It's a gloomy day today
Don't lean over the railing
Are you Tom's friends?
Who started this fire?
Did Tom clean his room?
Who cleaned this room?
Which cup should I use?
Which glass should I use?
Don't waste your food
Don't waste food
Do I have to read this?
Don't throw away food
How do you like country life?
I'm going to run a bath
I'm already doing a lot
Look what you've done!
I've never really liked Tom
I'm already overworked
You're musicians, aren't you?
Let's call a cab
Your head is empty!
You are just a rug head!
I didn't expect it to rain
I didn't think I'd be so late
Can I get a hint?
Could it be a coincidence?
I'll just watch
You're blocking traffic
We've been playing all day
Do I have to drink this?
I collect five-yen coins
He's his wife's servant
He's submissive to his wife
He's the best out of the best
She's lost touch with reality
Love doesn't just hurt
I'm not passionate about rice
I'm not really fond of rice
I'm not gifted in maths
Do you know the secret?
That's weird at the very least
I've got a plan B
I'm going to eat your banana
Who will kiss the frog?
What can we do for you?
I don't do it like that
I don't do it that way
How much does a night cost?
How could he do that?
I've received a letter
We had dinner at my uncle's
Have I changed?
It's a funny situation
It's an amusing situation
His dog died a few weeks ago.
Can I ask you a question?
No.
I'd like you to stay here
He's a disturbed adolescent
You weren't truthful with me
You didn't treat me honestly
You didn't treat me fairly
He's a man without scruples
Is glass a metal?
Who owns your politician?
It’s my favourite hobby
I found a crystal; look at it!
Don't miss it!
Sorry, but I don't care
Mom, I made a paper airplane
I've finally paid off my debt
Pay no attention to the mess!
Sanctions are wrong.
He's in bad shape
He's not doing so hot
Don't obey her
I don't like to be pitied
He has mountain-sized pride
He's my second cousin
I've asked Mary to marry me
Don't count me out so quickly
Don't count out Tom just yet
I think I'm losing my touch
You can look, but don't touch
This is all fake!
Where will you give your vote?
I don't think I'm up to it
I don't understand something
I'm sorely missing you
Where's Tom?
He's in his room.
He's a depraved old man
Thirty-seven!
Is her sister a candidate?
I don't like your new friends
What does slave mean?
I'm mentally tired
I'm psychologically exhausted
I'm breaking down
Tom's killing it!
That's one crazy high score.
It's a fluke
He can't be that good.
God bless you, and us with it!
John ruined Jessica's clothes
Jessica's dress is tacky
Please don't hate me for that
Get to the point, John
Get to the point, John.
OK.
This is Algeria and it's 2004
Not everyone was dumb, though
Is that hard to see?
Is that hard to say?
John will deal with that, too
It's not easy being John
Being nice is... easy, too
John's voice was coming back
John didn't have a backup plan
John doesn't have anyone
John couldn't see that
Why was John so unlucky?
John got mad, too
Promise you'll not steal again
Can I take a picture with you?
I'm done.
John's suit cost a fortune
John didn't want to admit it
I see that you're a good guy
John won't let Jessica down
John made a bunch of money./
John can't move heavy things
I'll treasure your advice
How does John know Jessica?
He'll be executed at dawn
The party was short-lived
The party didn't last long
It was 15 January 2019
I'll buy you a pint
I've dropped an earring
They don't want to go home
Have you got my nail file?
Do you have my nail file?
Let's study at your place
It was built in 1961
Let's study at school
It stood for 28 years
John's birthday was coming up
Why are you drooling?
The job is John's now
John hasn't written the essay
John's cast was taken off
Will you be my girlfriend?
Of course!
The postie's coming soon
John can't drink milk
How old are his parents?
John's bike is as good as new
My contentment was short-lived
Should John forgive Jessica?
She's young and pretty
He didn't get my allusion
Look at your car!
It really needs a wash!
Come on, put your jacket on
We're going to the car wash
You'll need a lot of money
I'll ring you when I'm there
I'll phone you when I'm there
I'll ring you when I get there
Do you love her or me?
They ask, and we answer
Do you love him or me?
There's a comma's missing.
No there's not.
Yes there is!
Isn't!
I'll prove it to you!
I can't stand hypocrites
Morning, sleepyhead!
Good morning, sunshine!
Long live Western Sahara!
It's Reagan's fault
Guess I'll die
What's your idea of happiness?
When will you get ready?
I'm sleepy as hell
Love isn't just pain
It's an incredible sensation
He wasn't exceptional
Did you manage to find a job?
Did you manage to get the job?
I want a big, dumb dog
He doesn't get us
The damage exceeded $300
There's really no damage
What kind of damage was there?
Now, I'm going into my room
It's a difficult route to take
You've broken our pact
We're here to talk to Tom
It's a squander of money
You may all die... but I won't
Tom kissed Godfather's hand
He doesn't understand us
He's in the mood to dance
No U-turns allowed
I don't have it any longer
Is Roger Waters a narcissist?
Am I out of touch?
That's called a birthmark
I'll go get you some drinks
I'm rambling too much
I've gone on much too long
We're straying off topic
Move the pawn to e4
How do you castle in chess?
It's black's turn
Don't leave us hanging
I'm in a bad way
He always been this selfish?
That's all you had to say
I'm pretty sure she's not gay
It's such a nice one
Gosh, if only she smiled more
No, no, it's my fault
If that's OK with you
Can we make this quick?
All I know is he's a good guy
I thought he'd be different
I swore I didn't do it
I don't get you
Maybe you've heard of him?
You're ruining my life!
Does this mean you're going?
You're not going
The hell is that?
Are you kidding?
He'll piss himself with joy

People actually live here?
You the new guy?
I'll give it a day
It's off
What does that give me?
Hey, do you mind?
Do what?
A deal's a deal
About time!
I'm on it
We'll take them
There're many suspects
Is there a risk of civil war?
Do your parents listen to you?
Here's Flavien
It's her boyfriend
It's his boyfriend
That's his boyfriend

Are you sure of that?
Are you surprised that I came?
Are you telling the truth?
Be there by 2:30 for sure
Can you shoot straight?
Did anyone phone me?
Do you have a telephone?
Do you like my new straw hat?
Don't stay up late tonight
Has it stopped raining?
Has the witness been sworn in?
I struck Tom in self-defense
I wasn't told a thing about it
I'll stay out of it
I've stopped worrying about it
Is my hat on straight?
Is this ladder steady enough?
It's a plausible story
It's no use
Tom can't be swayed
It's strange, but true
Strike Tom's name off the list
Sure, I'll do it
Surely you don't believe that
Tears won't do you any good
That's a strange thing to say
That's beyond my strength
This color doesn't suit you
Tom is sure to be back by 2:30
Tom's father was very strict
We're running out of supplies
What hotel are you staying at?
When do you stop work?
Where can we cross the stream?
Where's the telegraph office?
Who is that stranger?
Who tore this package open?
Will you teach me French?
You've stayed away a long time
He isn't dumber than you
She's not dumber than you
It's not dumber than you
They aren't dumber than you
I'll stand guard now
I'll stand guard now
You know what I just realized?
Er, who would that be?
Is it someone I know?
Where will we go for lunch?
Tom, you decide
I can't.
Why are you crying?
Can you spell "Massachusetts"?
Can I come tomorrow too?
Don't tell Tom
I don't want to worry him
You ruined my life!
Tom didn't look happy about it
It's not worth discussing
Will she live?
May I ask what that means?
You're ugly... but I love you
You're playing a game?
Can I join?
Sure.
Okay, cool.
Where is Tom?
I don't know
Maybe he's dead.
Why is it impossible?
You make more money than I do.
Why does everyone hate Tom?
That's impossible.
It's very much possible.
I've never seen a fat vegan
I'm really bored right now
Why wasn't I told about this?
Hello everyone!
Hello everyone!
I'm listening to Celtic music
How many?
I have 4.
Why would you?
Ah, I forgot my mobile phone
Still sleepy, right?
It smells like popcorn.
It really does!
Don't feel so down
Has this ever happened to you?
That's not quite right
I'm sure Tom will like it
I shouldn't have trusted Tom
That's a very good idea
Do you watch TV news?
Can we trust him?
Tom won't be ready
I'm sorry I didn't believe you
Tom couldn't find his passport
Please tell me what's going on
Have you returned?
Tom isn't happy here
Can't you see that?
What exactly do you mean?
What exactly do you want?
I'm not feeling that great
I'm giving you a second chance
Were you there before?
Stay with us!
Tatoeba: Always a good choice
I'll do it tomorrow
I'll go reassure him.
Mary, look!
Tom's on TV!
I didn't ask for any of this!
Come on, Tom
What are you waiting for?
I don't have an accent!
He's cute as a bug's ear
What does your dad do?
Do you work there, too?
Thanks for nothing, Tom
You'd better come inside
Have you told your mom?
Why are pandas so cute?
You kissed him?
Did he kiss you?
No, I kissed him!
What is there to discuss?
Did he touch your breasts?
Tom is your boyfriend?
Who did you kiss?
Where did you find these?
She's perfect at everything
You're perfect at everything
Isn't her ring gorgeous?
How about this one?
Exterminate," said the Dalek
Where's Toronto?
Does he like his new job?
You're sexy, trust me
Did we want snow?
Tom didn't get there in time
Let's go to Tom's place!
Canada is awesome!
Welcome to the family, Mina!
Is it your first trip here?
What are you guys doing here?
Did you hear about Tom?
What did you say?
What do you think I said?
I don't want him to die
I don't want her to die
Do you love nature?
Coming right up, sir
I'm about to get married!
That's Mary
Well, I really can't say
On the house, Tom
She's a wannabe actress
I've got to talk to everybody
What's Tom's full name?
I've got reservations for us
They tricked me!
What happened?
Don't worry, Tom
I've got this
You're talking crazy now
Don't worry, guys
I've got this
You're not ugly
As a child, I loved Barbie
Sorry, I am late
Elementary, my dear Watson
You're students, aren't you?
He's a bus driver
He's not a bus driver, is he?
That's all I have to do
That's all you have to do!
I'll give you a lift
How are you fixed with money?
I'll visit a museum today
I'll go to a museum today
I've climbed Mt
I think that's too expensive
You're very kind to me
You're too thin
Why, no, I'm not tired
Why, what do you mean?
Why not come along with us?
Who's the top man here?
Who's going to try your case?
Who threw that?
Who thought this up?
Where's my towel?
Where is your wife?
Where can I park this truck?
What's the theme of the novel?
What shall we do tonight?
What do you think of that guy?
What do I do then?
Well, you know what they say
Well, then, let's talk it over
Tom's story really touched us
Tom's hair is thinning
This machine won't work
There, now you've done it
Then why bother at all?
That's the man I mean
Please don't touch those books
On the whole, I agree with you
May I trouble you for a match?
May I come, too?
Let's walk toward town
Let's go to the movies
It's too hot to go for a walk
It's a wicked thing to do
It's pretty good, though
Is today payday?
Is this a through street?
Is it far to town?
I'm too tired to go on
I'm sorry that this happened
I'm glad you came out on top
I'll thread the needle for you
I'll see you tomorrow morning
I won't be in town this Sunday
I think I'll go now
I don't want that much milk
I don't trust this driver
I can't think of a thing
I can't eat this much food
Here, try my pen
Have you seen tonight's paper?
Have you met all these people?
Has my trunk come yet?
Do you know this man?
Do you know their address?
Did you try this key?
Can you get there by car?
Are you telling me the truth?
Are you a friend of theirs?
Are these bags yours?
Am I too late?
I can't walk that fast
Can you see him moving?
Can you see her moving?
The train's about to leave
Why does this matter?
Tom doesn't really want to go
Oh my God, it's a lion!
Get in the car!
What does your father work as?
It's a slow day, huh
I don't feel so hot today
What is art?
She can't be ill
How?
I'm giving you one last chance
This is my umbrella, not Tom's
I don't want Tom to know
She has snow-white skin
She's usually home on Sundays
I'm sorry
Did you watch the Oscars?
Did you look under the table?
It doesn't matter what you do
It doesn't matter what I do
Do you want something, too?
I've thought about that a lot
They're speaking together
It's so expensive!
Will you come to see us?
What's wrong with it?
I wonder what's wrong with it
I wonder what's wrong with it
Tom used to be a mama's boy
What did you have for lunch?
They were really delicious!
You look so healthy!
Congratulations!
What a great strike!
I've lost my strength
So what if I'm gay?
I'm drinking
How can you be so pessimistic?
Which fruit do you want?
Oh" can show surprise
What is the sequential rule?
Don't be noisy or step out
You're part of me
Where is your jacket?
Where is your coat?
Have you received the cheque?
Did you get the cheque?
He's doing his German homework
About time it's not him
Who is it then, boy?
Remember me?
No.
Well, well
Are we supposed to?
Marie wasn't thirsty
Enough!
Neither does your whining.
Hey, everyone!
I'm back!
My boy, you're late
Link!
What happened?
You are my son!
Great!
Hey, King!
My boy!
I'm evil!
I'm evil too!
Great!
Great!
It's time
I set the alarm to 7
Are these books yours or mine?
Have you attained your goal?
Impa?!
You're a slut!
You smell like shit!
Enough!
Where's His Majesty?
Ganon captured the King!
Ganon is a prick...
I know!
Hmm..
I'm going fishing!
Can I come too?
Yes!
Beautiful!
My ship sails in the morning.
Hmm..
I'm going to walk then.
A month?
A month.
A whole month?
A whole month.
Really?
Yes.
A whole month?
No.
A month is four weeks.
One?
Four!
Two?
Four!
Come on, father, let's go!
What about me?
Stay here!
Hmm..
Fari!
Yes!
Hey, what's going on?
I am gay!
Really?
No, Michael, you dense ass!
My boy, what is it?
I'm going to join Ganon!
Aren't I funny?
No, you're not.
Huh?
Yeah, Zelda's right
Your dinner is boring!
She's a student
You're eating
Godspeed!
Don't smoke!
Don't spit on the floor!
Keep to the right!
What are we to believe now?
Get in the car loser!
We're going shopping
Do you want to die here?
The future hasn't happened yet
It's an easy way to make money
Hey, that's my hobby
I've deleted my comment
I'm trying to get some sleep
I can't live without you
You're the only woman for me
Yes, we have two children
It's on the first floor
With whom is the appointment?
May I come tomorrow, too?
I'm going to a store
You'll see the students
She's looking for a hotel
We'll come home in two hours
You'll see the house today
A banker's life is hard
I can't find my umbrella!
It's already night here
Do you not also think so?
He went to the student's house
How are you this morning?
Do you want food?
Do you want eggs?
What kind of food is there?
Do you want gruel?
Yes, bring me gruel
Are there any bananas?
He's been drinking beer
I'm a huge fan of trains
Are you a huge fan of trains?
You're a huge fan of trains
He's a huge fan of trains
His self-denial is admirable
Girls, you're gorgeous!
We'll come to look for you
Gosh!
July 1969 AD
That's not what I expected
It's standard policy
What did she mean by that?
I don't know.
It's time to face the music
Listen to this song, Tom
Is this your idea of a joke?
When did she say that?
I don't remember.
What did you say?
I was just talking to myself.
What is Tom doing?
Get out and leave me alone!
That's really not necessary
I'm just so lost right now
Tom's cooking breakfast
Tom's cooking breakfast.
It's kind of cute
Where did all the money go?
You shouldn't have said that
I think it's kind of stupid
Can you help me with these?
Can you help me with this?
I'm not having an affair
He's afraid I'll get lost
Tom blew smoke in Mary's face
Are you leaving already?
I hope he's not angry
It's a setup
I'm not ready to be a mother
I'm very quiet in class
Please don't quote me
Please don't jump
Was it scary?
I wasn't sure it was you
It's so good to hear from you
Tom's arm is in a sling
Did Tom say anything about me?
Is he married?
Tom's car has been repossessed
Does Tom have a big family?
You're so emotional
She doesn't know her place
He doesn't know his place
Lol, this is so funny
I know Tom doesn't like me
How old is Tom now?
How old was Tom at that time?
Can Tom see us?
Is Tom still mad at me?
Is Tom satisfied?
I don't speak Estonian
How did the trip go?
Do you concur?
He doesn't stop
I'll buy some ice cream
I've got a bike
How many students have you?
Have you got three children?
Are there seven blankets?
We have forty-four guests
My daughter's pet is a rat
Whose mussels are these?
Do you have a second for me?
Tom, look at what I made!
How is Tom Jr.?
Is Tom still there?
Where could Tom be?
Are you sure Tom can do this?
I'm not singing
I'll see you tonight at eight
Tom doesn't want you to know
I'm grateful for what Tom did
Don't take off your shoes!
You're being very unreasonable
Tom hasn't changed his mind
I must exact my revenge!
Zelda, this is Ganon's place!
Again?
Take me to Gamelon.
Yes, Your Majesty!
Now we're here!
Enough!
I'm going to talk to Ganon!
Hey, Ganon!
Ganon? ...Ganon!
Silence!
You dare?!" "...GANON!
What?!
Link!
'Sup?
King Harkinian has died." "...
You dorkface!
What about Ganon?
He died as well!
A-ah!
You runt!
He didn't have lunch
I won't buy the car tomorrow
My boyfriend is so photogenic!
In the end, it's not that bad
I can't find her anywhere
It's driving me mad!
I can't find him anywhere
It's driving me mad!
Tom is well-liked
I guess you don't need my help
If you're ready, we'll begin
He's a kind and thoughtful man
She's going into labor
Did you draw this yourself?
Hello, I'm Tom
What's your name?
Hello, I'm Mary
What's your name?
Are you afraid of girls, Tom?
I'm confused and frustrated
He's dead
I'm so vain
It's elementary, my dear Tom
Tom, is that you?
Hi mom, it's me.
I've just turned 20
Why are we celebrating?
Is Tom looking at me?
Tom won't approve
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom doesn't want kids
Tom's shoes are dirty
Tom's hands are dirty
Tom's face is dirty
When is Tom coming back?
Next time, don't come so early
What did you expect me to say?
Have you spoken to Tom yet?
Did Tom say he was worried?
This place is awesome!
You surprise me all the time!
Does Tom seem insane to you?
Duke Onkled, it's tax season!
You are under a ton of taxes!
Don't hurt me, taxes!
Please!
I'll pay you this key!
Now go away!
Tom took off his T-shirt
Wasn't Tom your boyfriend?
How do you think Tom is doing?
I've never been to Tom's house
What's Tom talking about?
I can't afford to retire
I'm not afraid to fight
Aren't you pleased?
That's just what Tom needs
I've asked Tom to help us
Were you tired?
Weren't you tired?
You weren't tired
I've just eaten
Tom didn't want Mary to go
Can you see anyone?
Can't you see that?
Do you see anybody?
Did Tom see anything?
Did you see someone?
Let's see if we can help you
Are you surprised to see me?
Do you want to see my scar?
What do you see now?
When can we see Tom?
Didn't you see that?
Did you see anything?
What do you see here?
Where did you see that?
Did anybody see you there?
Can I see that again?
May I see that again?
Did you go to see Tom?
Did you just see that?
Did you see Tom leave?
Did you see Tom today?
You've got to see this
You'd better see for yourself
When did you see my scar?
What time did you see Tom?
What does Tom see in you?
What do you see out there?
Well, I'll see you later
Now do you see my point?
Nobody's going to see you
Maybe I'll see you there
Maybe I'll see you later
Maybe I'll see you around
Look, I'll see you later
Let's see you do better
Let's see what you can do
It's great to see you again
I guess I'll see you later
How can you not see that?
Hey, you've got to see this
Hey, did you see that?
Here, see what you can do
Here, see for yourself
Do you see Tom anywhere?
Do you see the connection?
Did you see who it was?
Did you see who did it?
Did you see what Tom did?
Did you see what it was?
Did you see what happened?
Did you see Tom go aboard?
Did you see the picture?
Did you see the knife?
Did you go and see Tom?
Can't you see who it is?
Can't you see Tom is sick?
Can't you see Tom is dying?
Can we see you a second?
She's dead.
No, it's not possible!
Are we going to see you soon?
Are you going to see Tom?
Are you seeing someone else?
Can't you see Tom is in agony?
Can't you see Tom is injured?
Can't you see Tom is upset?
Can't you see we're talking?
Did you just see something?
Did you see it on the news?
Did you see who was inside?
Do you see what this means?
Do you see what Tom is doing?
Do you think Tom saw anything?
Do you think Tom saw it, too?
Do you think Tom saw it?
Don't you see what it means?
Have you been seeing a shrink?
Have you seen it work?
Have you seen my keys?
Have you seen my phone?
Have you seen something?
Have you seen the news?
Have you seen the paper?
Have you seen this before?
Have you seen this file?
Have you seen this movie?
Have you seen this pamphlet?
Have you seen today's paper?
Haven't we seen Tom before?
Haven't you seen the plans?
How are you not seeing that?
I didn't see the explosion
I haven't seen a thing
I'll see you in an hour
I've been seeing things
I've got to see someone
I've seen it done
Let's just see you do that
Let's see if we can get inside
Let's see what Tom has to say
Let's see what we have here
Maybe I'll see you in Boston
Now I've seen everything
OK, sorry, see you tomorrow
So, are you seeing anyone?
We'll see what we can do
What did you see at that time?
What did you see that night?
What if somebody sees you?
He's lazy and dishonest
He doesn't go to church
I bet you can't do this
Are any of you coming with me?
Are you coming back?
Are you coming in?
Are you going to come back?
Aren't you coming inside?
Aren't you coming with us?
Can we come in for moment?
Can we come in?
Can we come with you?
Can you come and get me?
Can you come closer?
Can you come with me?
Can you come with us, please?
Could I come in for a moment?
Could we come in, please?
Could you come and get me?
Could you come in here, please
Could you come into my office?
Could you come to my quarters?
Could you come up here?
Did anyone see you come in?
Did Tom see you come in?
Did you come for me?
How about you come with me?
How come you ask?
How come you didn't do it?
How did you come up with that?
How did you come up with this?
Is Tom coming back?
It'll come to me
It'll come to you
Just come with me, please
May I come aboard?
Maybe they'll come back
Maybe they'll come for you
Maybe Tom isn't coming back
This knot's coming loose
Tom said he wasn't coming back
Tom's birthday's coming up
What did they come up with?
What did you come to see?
What if Tom doesn't come back?
When can Tom come home?
When did you come in?
When will you be coming back?
When's Tom coming back?
Where do you all come from?
Why aren't you coming home?
Why did Tom come to Boston?
Why did Tom have to come back?
Why did you come back?
Why did you come in here?
Why didn't you come to me?
Why do we have to wait?
Why is Tom coming here?
Why not come with me?
Why would Tom come now?
Would you come here, please?
Would you come in, please?
Would you come to my quarters?
Would you come with us, sir?
What antivirus are you using?
Where is Tom going?
Tom pulled Mary's hair
What was Tom doing there?
Tom wiped Mary's tears away
Excuse me, may I borrow a pen?
How could Tom not know?
How could you not know?
How could they not know?
How could you be so sure?
How could you not notice?
How could you not see me?
How could you think that?
What could you have done?
Yeah, you could be right
Yeah, you could say that
How could you not remember?
How could Tom do that to me?
How could Tom do this to me?
Where could they have gone?
How could you not know that?
How could Tom not be jealous?
How could you do that to Tom?
How could Tom do this to Mary?
What do you think it could be?
How far is the next farm?
What do you grow on your farm?
Did you plant this yourself?
It's rather hot out here
Where is everyone else?
I'm going to Stockholm
I've lost his number
I've lost her number
I'm tired to make a brave guy
I'd like to live in Italy
Can I use them with you?
Why are you scared?
Oh my God!
You're so stupid!
How do I look?
You look retarded.
Should I cut my hair?
How do I look?
You look fine.
How do I look?
You look great.
Your ignorance is astonishing!
Do you think I need a haircut?
Tom, are you feeling alright?
I don't know why Tom did this
I wish you could've met Tom
He's a wonderful guy
He's a little too old for me
You're a little too old for me
Why do you need to know?
I don't have a lover
I have what you're looking for
Have you ever eaten tempeh?
He's not from around here
I found this in her purse.
Oh my God!
That's mine!
Tom isn't from around here
Tom isn't from Boston
Don't even worry about it
I'll pay you for everything
We'll take good care of Tom
Do you think we should worry?
Don't tell me not to worry
Don't worry about it, Tom
It's not your problem
Don't worry about it
It's no big deal
Don't worry about it
Don't worry about me
I'm OK
Don't worry
Don't worry
Don't worry
Everything's going to work out
Don't worry
Don't worry
I'll be here the whole time
Don't worry
I'll get home safely
Don't worry
I'll let you know when to turn
Don't worry
Don't worry
I'll pay you for everything
Don't worry
Don't worry
I've already taken care of it
Don't worry
It won't take very long
Don't worry
It's going to be fine
Don't worry
It's not the end of the world
Don't worry
Don't worry
Don't worry
Don't worry
Don't worry, Tom
Don't worry
Don't worry
We'll find Tom
Don't worry
Don't worry
We're not going to leave you
Don't worry
You'll get used to it
Hey, don't worry about it, Tom
I worried about Tom's health
Don't worry
It's nothing to worry about
It's just a scratch
Just don't worry about it, OK?
Let's not worry about that now
Let's worry about that later
Quit worrying, OK?
That's nothing to worry about
There's no need for worry
We'll let Tom worry about that
We'll sort this out
Don't worry
Well, let's not worry about it
What's there to worry about?
Worrying isn't going to help
You don't have to worry, Tom
You shouldn't worry
You're going to be OK
Don't worry
Can we stay here?
Tom wasn't thirsty
Does Tom like his new job?
Can I come tomorrow, too?
I haven't found a job yet
Oh!
Where did you go?
Right here!
See how he reacts.
No.
Oh, that is so like Link!
How queer.
Éamonn did it
That woman's son is sick
His Majesty..
Link kissed me!
This is illegal, you know.
What?
Luigi, look!
It's from Link
Save me!'
We gotta save Link!
Shit!
Don't you see my garden?
They're normal people
What do they have in mind?
It isn't bound to Turkish lira
I hope Tom isn't angry
Let's stay focused
Tom's had a lot of girlfriends
We've got to hurry
He's jealous
Don't ride a bicycle on sand
I want to kiss my girlfriend!
You're being very unfair, Tom
Okay, I'll do it
You can't force me to go!
He has no idea that I'm coming
I feel like I'm not wanted
And what are you implying?
I'm not implying anything.
How are you?
I'm fine, thanks.
I have found it!
While we live, let us live
This one?
No, that one!
Did you mean this one?
No, I meant that one!
Are you coming?
Don't mention it to Tom
Don't mention it to Mary
It was God's will
Hello, may I speak to Tom?
You're very good with people
He's trying to use you
Don't marry him!
We have time, there's no rush
Why should I care about this?
Why should I care about him?
Why should I care about her?
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing that, Tom?
I just don't feel like it
Do you find me attractive?
I'm not going to the meeting
I'm not listening to music
Tom, come back here!
Where is Atlantis?
What?
I know she'll agree
I know he'll agree
He's stark naked
I hope you've had a great day!
The painting won't be sold
It's a redundant text
There's a revision of his work
There's a revision of her work
We didn't reach the summit
Wow, you have 2 girlfriends?
I'll take care of the rest
Why are you protecting him?
Why are you protecting her?
Why does Tom call me Mary?
Isn't your name Mary?
No, it's Maria.
What did you think it was?
Can I touch your beard?
I'll miss you, too
You're pretty cute, too
You're really pretty, too
Tom likes knitting, too
Guys have feelings, too
I started to cry, too
Men cry, too
And I want to kiss him, too
Yes, you did.
Don't mind me, Tom
It's a good thing you're cute

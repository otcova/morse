Omigod!
Have you figured it out yet?
You won't get away with it!
Our store is open 24/7
How pretty!
I'm from Israel
Stop moving around so much!
You're not an idiot
I know you're not an idiot
I'm such an idiot!
Is this a test?
Every now and then, we eat out
That guy is so tall!
I've baked a cake for you
What is he currently doing?
Bad people aren't born bad
I don't owe anyone anything
I don't have any cash
It's not you, it's me
How about that?
Wikipedia opens again!
Who is this Tom?
She doesn't always come late
Does this car belong to you?!
Does this car belong to you?
If I don't come, who will?
Bush doesn't like war
Bush's English is perfect
Bush doesn't like torture
Bush is not al-Qaida's friend
Bush is not Bin Laden's friend

Do you think that that's okay?
The pain is here, right?
That's a stomach ache
He's smarter than me
She's smarter than me
We're candid
Who said it?
What's the big deal?!
He won't listen
It's like talking to the wall
I'm in the zone
Do not disturb!
Once in a while, we eat out
Wow, that is one badass dude!
Tom is a douchebag!
No go?
I'll think of a way to do it
You know what she said to me?
Is it hard to be vegan?
You're not impressing me
Are you trying to impress me?
God doesn't play dice!
I can't comment
Nobody wants your books!
It's natural that he know
I'm waiting for this trip
I'm sarcastic
It's January now
Naturally, it snows
You didn't eat this morning
Of course you're hungry
I don't like to be hugged
Bring me some soup, please
At first I didn't know
The others weren't so lucky
I don't know
Let's find out!
Have you ever been to Turkey?
He smokes 3 packs a day
I don't regret it one bit
Don't read in the dark
It's not good for your eyes
Stop calling him that!
Stop calling me that!
He's a clever little bugger
You little bugger!
Sorry, I was woolgathering
He's completing your order
He didn't invent gunpowder
Why do you care?
Do you care who helps us?
Do you care where we go?
Do you care when we leave?
Do you care how much it costs?
Did you like this video?
Does it matter to you?
But where do pigeons sleep?
What did you say to me?
If you're tired, go to bed
Leave now so you're not tardy
It's just not worth the effort
It's far from over
It's not over yet
I translate what I want!
I don't translate for you!
It shouldn't be like this
But it's wonderful!
I like this program a lot!
You are abusing your power!
It's a wildlife sanctuary
So what is it going to be?
These shoes don't fit anymore
This shirt doesn't fit anymore
If you don't mind
I think he's making fun of you
She's making fun of you
There's no cover charge
That's a tough cookie
Why was the light burnt out?
I don't intend to do that
You aren't allowed in here
You aren't allowed in there
Don't kill yourself
So Dolkun's come as well!
Alas, I've no time today
So she's swindled me
So he didn't go to school
How did you solve it?
Eh, I managed somehow.
Do you like the apple pie?
Would you like some water?
Do you like apple pies?
Remember your promise!
Don't worry!
I can keep a secret!
Let him do whatever he wants!
It's far to go by feet!
Let's take the car
The road is frozen!
Don't let him drive!
They would make them rich!
Let him do what he wants!
Is this sentence correct?
Where is the pine forest?
Where's the pine forest?
The water's great
The water's nice
Why is he in the church?
Why is she in the church?
Why are you in the church?

What are you reading?
I'm not reading
I'm drawing.
Do you have a cigarette?
What is he doing with her?
What is she doing with him?
Are you a foreigner?
Tom said he was dog-tired
I'll solve that problem
Eat the rich, they're plumper
Are you shy?
He's a car salesman
He's a used car salesman
I'm going to the post office
Don’t think of cost
Finally it's Friday
I don't blame her for this
I don't blame him for this
I don't blame them for this
I don't blame you for this
I'm the one in the middle
God be with you!
Good God!
I don't want to look stupid
Her horse doesn't respect her
She's lucky to be alive
He's lucky to be alive
They went ice-skating together
You're not a spy, or are you?
She's eating a pear
Who is Tom?
Have you come to save me?
Don't let me die!
I've come to save you
Yes, my angel
I'll see her today
I'll see him today
They're engaged
She's engaged to another man
He's engaged to another woman
She's easily distracted
This book is my father's
I'm sending you a book
They're close to the Germans
He's been away for six months
I'm learning how to write
This is worse than a bomb!
Have you ever seen this?
How are you going to do it?
I've come to save her
I've come to save him
I've come to save the princess
I've come to save Tom
I'm really sleepy
I'm invincible!
Why are you being so generous?
What's in your cauldron?

She's an evil witch
She's a benevolent witch
He's a werewolf
It's an emergency
Are you telling me what to do?
He's rich, tall and famous
He's tall, famous and rich
He's well dressed
I don't expect you to remember
Home-made cookies are the best
Do you like only the boys?
Please, bite me on my neck
I'll be very careful
Will you be ready by 2:30?
I'm glad it makes you happy
It doesn't look so bad
It doesn't matter so much
It doesn't seem very fair
That's pretty normal
We've arrived a little late
What is its cost?
Thank you, that will be enough
What will you eat?
I have lost my money-bag
Why don't you wear a dress?
You've already forgotten
Is this a sexual thing?
I didn't have those shoes
Hello, my friends!
It's about my brother
Oh, Mary!
Stay still!
You're lucky!
What do you mean by exactly?
Darn it, I forgot my camera!
Oh, hello
It's quite hot today really!
I've decided to take a nap
Tom's in a slump lately
May I eat this bread?
Why?
I do not know why.
Where's your mom, Tom?
Where is the South Station?
Brrr, it's cold!
That's not a doctor
Tom, you idiot!
You bastard, I'll kill you!
I'm a Japanese student
Hey, you!
Who is Rory?
How was it?
Don't confuse love and desire
I can't eat anything
It was 30% off during the sale
I don't like iced coffee
Don't play dumb
Answer my question properly!
Let's get drunk today!
You'll just be a hindrance
It's Tom's birthday today
I'll go brush my teeth
What is "Tatoeba"?
Is it some kind of new trend?
I don't want to go to the pool
Let's go to the pool
The water's really nice
Oh, come on
It won't be so bad
We'll have fun
Praise the Lord!
She's scared to try new things
It's fall where they are
That's all you think about!
That's all he thinks about
It's Tokyo
I don't care about him anymore
I don't care about her anymore
Who's coming to our party?
Who's coming to help?
He's quite handsome, isn't he?
Eureka!" shouted Tom suddenly
Why is the sky blue?
We'll go after we eat
Jeweler!
Locksmith!
Tom is Mary's twin brother
Do you want to go together?
Let's meet at 6:30
What will I do?
Well, what shall we do?
I'm happy when I'm with you
When are you expecting?
What will I do?
Where're Tom's things?
He's all I have
She's all I have
I'm very proud of my parents
I don't need anything from you
Is it the best thing they did?
Who did you learn French from?
Learn!
What happens today?
What's going to happen today?
He thinks that's normal
The boss is there?
Some are good, some aren't
Is the boss there?
Is that what Tom would want?
I feel as if I'm catching cold
Do you know all these fellows?
Who's that fellow over there?
I know what I'm fighting for
I'll expect you at 2:30
I've never felt so hot
Do you feel hungry?
How do you feel about this?
Ah, I see!
That's Rio de Janeiro!
Right now, I want to go to bed
Blast off!
Did you serve in the military?
Listen up, everybody!
Listen, everybody!
Don't thank me, thank Tom!
I'd like to meet his father
I'd like to meet her father
Sweet dreams, my princess
Tom retired at the age of 67
The neighbor's lawn is greener
A barking dog doesn't bite
Do we have grated cheese?
I'm addicted to soap operas
It's too loud in the club
UN" stands for "United Nations
That's beyond me
Search; find; discover!
Tom's happy
We're going to the pool
Your book was stolen?!
Where and when?
I couldn't walk anymore
I'm trying to do you a favour
How about Brazil?
Are you coming?
It's a plan to implement
That night, I was really sad
Let's kill the filthy usurper!
We must leave tomorrow!
We have to leave tomorrow!
I'm an expert at programming
I'm not as expert as you are
I don't like being home alone
Are you still awake?
I'm venturesome
Tom showed up 15 minutes late
Tom is 3 years older than Mary
Mom's working
He comes home at five-thirty
I don't have any siblings
Mommy's working
Dad's working
Daddy's working
Close the curtains!
Close the curtains!
I'm prepared for the worst
My stomach's completely full
Sorry, I can't drink alcohol
How heavy is your suitcase?
The jam jar's lid is jammed
Oh no!
It's a power outage!
I'm losing my powers
I'm begging you father
We don't look the same at all
He's dead drunk
Did you get a sunburn?
Oh, look, look!
Put them away properly!
Oh, look!
I can't bend
I'll persuade him not to go
I'll convince him not to go
I'm sorry
I'm sorry I called you names
Please, calm down!
He's getting a kiss
If I were you, I'd ignore it
Nothing's going my way today
Why did you lie to me?
Why are you lying to me?
Why are you lying to me?
I'm not lying.
Who cares about soup?
Hey, sonny, what is it?
Are you lost?
Do you agree or disagree?
Never forget this, please
Did you come alone today?
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
I'll give that to Tom
I can't go out
I don't believe what Tom says
I've read this book
Two days ago, I read that book
He didn't eat pizza yesterday
Have you got a bike?
I'm having dinner now
I'm eating dinner now
I'm watching TV at the moment
She is leaving at nine o'clock
She's got her favourite CD
Where's Tom?
He's playing tennis with Mary.
Have you written the letter?
No, I'm writing it now.
She isn't doing her homework
She's reading a book
Let's go out!
It's not raining
I don't like your friends
They're always complaining
I'm not running
I bought a T-shirt
Did you work last night?
I didn't win the match
Have you got a pet?
I haven't a best friend
Has he worked all day?
I hope they're all correct
He's handsome and funny
She's a wedding consultant
He's working in the car
I'm wearing an orange T-shirt
There will be no mercy!
It's an idiom
Have you heard the big news?
It's too spicy for me
Some people don't wear pajamas
So you'll do it?
He's a singer
I hadn't heard of it
He isn't running
What do you love about me?
Somebody's at the front door
How do you call your dog?
Did you get wet?
Unfortunately!
Where are you calling from?
I'm calling from Boston
I'm calling from Tom's
I'm calling from Tom's house
Are you still angry?
Are you still mad?
She's a young student
Do these ladies speak French?
Who had this idea?
He's in my class
Try again!
It's a limited-time offer
It's a beautiful thing
It's a beautiful flower
It's a beautiful painting
I'm calling from Tom's place
I don't live in Boston yet
I don't want to miss it!
What am I going to write here?
I don't know what I'm doing
Who wants to do that?
Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry
Aim for the eyes!
I'm going to buy a home
I'm not like I used to be
It didn't have to be like this
That's a lovely necklace
I'm awfully afraid of heights
Six squared equals thirty-six
Tom is about half Mary's age
First, he entered the room
Did you already use my cup?
How could I ever trust you?
We're nearly out of time
I wasn't being serious
Which shoes are you wearing?
Why preach to deaf ears?
I'm in Tel Aviv
I'm not picking your figs
I'm not digging your wells
My life's a contradiction
I'm lying on the grass
Thanks for your help.
It was nothing.
I arrived within 30 minutes
What are those little dots?
Could you make me a sandwich?
He doesn't learn German
It's hard to hit a curveball
Really?
How old are you?
She's still a child after all
This isn't a useful expression
Is one of you Tom?
She's beautiful
Make his identikit!
Hungarian blood is true blood!
Well, go faster
Where's your tarantula?
I don't know
How pretty you are!
I'm not sewing your clothes
He's coming before me
I'm playing with my son
Who is this important to?
Excuse me, I can't stay long
Sorry, but I can't stay long
I would've left
We're going to have a boy
It's just a boy
A small boy ate a Kit-Kat
I'm crazy about soccer
The king is naked!
The bank closes at 3pm
It's very sharp
I've always liked soccer
Give me a glass of milk!
She's one year older than me
A little boy had a Kit-Kat
Everything must go!
I don't need you any more
She's a dance teacher
You're unoriginal
You're original
I'm in Papua New Guinea
Are you in Bangladesh?
I'm watching a documentary
I've been studying Greek
Why do you seem so angry?
Why do you look so angry?
I don't like you!
Where's your friend?
Don't cry
It's going to be okay
I'm very sleepy and it's late
Can I touch your hair?
Tom can't afford a new car
I'll go and buy some chocolate
I love you Mary!
That's wrong!
Are you working tomorrow?
I'm missing you more than ever
I'm eating the meat
Let's talk on Skype
I don't like pineapple
I'm not young like Tom
I was late, right?
I don't have two cats
I'm Chinese
I'm Russian
He's a master at the curveball
Fuck my life!
Tom's got an analytical mind
Tom, where are you?
Everyone's looking for you!
Are you happy to be alive?
Yes, I'm happy.
Holy guacamole!
Hi, my name's Tom!
What happened?
Tom's car hit a tree
Tom's car swerved off the road
I'd like a seat over a wing
Don't be an asshole
Don't be a bitch
There's so much I want to do
What's holding you back?
That's what most people do
How does a calculator work?
How does a calculator do math?
How do computers do math?
How does a computer work?
It's a book on computer logic
Say it's not so!
What is a think tank?
What is on your mind, Tom?
What is worrying you, Tom?
What is a think factory?
Where are our umbrellas?
I don't know
I know she's pretty
I know that he's calling
I know you're irritated
I know you're bothered
She's the new intern
He's the new intern
Why did you buy a German car?
Why did you buy a Korean car?
Why did you buy a British car?
What a bummer!
He's not studying German
You're in my heart
There's a defect here
There's a defect there
Maybe there's a cheaper one
It'll be dry
It'll be sunny
It'll be partly cloudy
It'll be cloudy
You're a dream come true
You're my sweetie
You're dear to me
You're my beloved
It'll be easier for all of us
What's your problem?
I don't understand
This coat doesn't have pockets
I'd like to withdraw some cash
It's so important to me
Don't worry
I don't trample your wheat
Emily isn't afraid of spiders
Is the pencil long?
Are they eating the apple?
Does she eat the apple?
I'll get along on my own
I'm Laotian
Did you eat anything?
Why do I need help?
Why do you think I need help?
You need help, Tom
What's new this year?
It's just a tale
Man's knowledge is finite
Does this sound familiar?
I've never thought about it
It's my favorite dish!
He didn't name names
He didn't want to name names
Do you know where he is?
Where did I go wrong?
This isn't tasteless
Zombies are coming!
I'm in a perfect world
Read this book!
When did you start loving me?
You're my man
I'm from Canada", he said
Where did I leave my glasses?
I'm not against your plan
What about our dance?
That's dangerous!
How many mangos will you want?
Maybe that's right
What about you, honey?
How much do I need to pay?
It's already Tuesday?
Can you teach me Portuguese?
Could you teach me Macedonian?
I'll go to the beach
I'll eat the apple
I'll forgive you this time
I didn't go to school
I can't believe my ears!
Is it a crime to love someone?
The pizza's on the way
Don't ever talk to me again!
How are y'all?
Facebook runs his life!
Tom can't be killed
I couldn't kill you, Tom
You're special, Tom
Tom can't be stopped
Where'd Tom go?
I'm not your dad
I'm not your toy
Do you want to see me?
What kind of person are you?
What kind of person am I?
You can't do this alone
Tom can't do this alone
Tom, meet your new nanny
What are you gonna do, Tom?
Are you gonna kill me?
Tom, get ready for school
I've been misunderstood
You're really not Tom?
Let's move
How did you know I was here?
It's all about revenge
What is the plan, exactly?
I'm not a boy anymore
I'm not a girl anymore
That's all the English I know
Do you want me to go away?
Are you doing this for money?
Are you even listening to me?
We're free now
You're free now
What are you so afraid of?
We're not enemies
Who's in charge around here?
He's my doppelganger
She's my doppelgänger
Would you recommend any book?
Don't be afraid, I'm with you
Do you want fish?
She's a feminist
She fought for women's rights
Ladies and gentlemen..
I'm in Dubai
He's baling the hay
That's all they had
That's all they have
That's all she has
That's all he has
I'll read the book
I'm happy the way I am
He's a funny man
He's a little goody two-shoes
I've never had sushi
I'm a wreck
Oh, seriously?
It's kosher but it's smelly
What a cute cat!
How do you get downtown?
Where do I need to turn?
The store's closed
How long is the movie?
I'm going to bed early tonight
I don't believe in miracles
You're a hard nut to crack
Wake me up at six, please
I've got a rock in my shoe
Did you eat all the cookies?
Did Tom eat all the cookies?
Would you like another one?
Which laptop do I need?
Please get out of the car, sir
I'm very poor
I think he's drunk quite a lot
It's not raining, is it?
I'm really hungry
Why did you give it up?
There's nobody in the house
Everybody's outside
There's no one in the house
They're all outside
Don't cry
Everything's going to be OK
I was at Tom's house
Where were you?
He's dangerous
They don't want you
I'm sure of it
It wasn't Tom's idea
Are you feeling better today?
You've dialed the wrong number
You're wearing the wrong shoes
You're the best at what you do
You're needed here immediately
You're named after your father
You're full of surprises today
You'll never guess what we saw
You'll meet Tom tomorrow night
You'll be answering the phones
You don't seem to be very busy
You can't be busy all the time
You aren't supposed to be here
Whatever you do, do it quietly
Whatever you do, do it quickly
We've never lied to each other
We're ready when you're ready
We're outnumbered three to one
We're only thirty minutes away
We're not that far from Boston
We're glad to have you with us
We'll be home all day tomorrow
Tom won't mind if we stay here
Tom won't give you any trouble
Tom won't ask you to work late
Tom wasn't supposed to do that
Tom was wearing John's sweater
Tom was wearing John's pajamas
Tom still doesn't look so good
Tom should've listened to Mary
Tom should've arrived by now
Tom says he didn't see anybody
Tom said you were good-looking
Tom put his bag on Mary's desk
Tom probably doesn't like Mary
Tom pretended he didn't see it
Tom knows he shouldn't do that
Tom isn't wearing a belt today
Tom is a good friend of Mary's
Tom has a three-month-old baby
Tom doesn't think Mary is busy
Tom doesn't like that too much
Tom doesn't know what it means
Tom doesn't know what he wants
Tom doesn't even have a pencil
Tom doesn't appear to be happy
Tom doesn't always get his way
Tom doesn't act like a teacher
Tom didn't think Mary was ugly
Tom didn't seem very concerned
Tom didn't seem to remember us
Tom didn't seem to remember me
Tom didn't see that one coming
Tom didn't say where he'd gone
Tom didn't make me do anything
Tom didn't like Mary very much
Tom didn't leave me any choice
Tom didn't know where Mary was
Tom didn't give me any trouble
Tom ate one of Mary's cupcakes
Tom asked me for Mary's number
Tom and Mary will come at 2:30
Tom and Mary weren't much help
Tom and Mary weren't impressed
Tom and Mary just don't get it
Tom and Mary aren't far behind
This is Mary, my ex-girlfriend
They're your friends, not mine
They'll be here in ten minutes
The movie wasn't all that good
The less Tom knows, the better
Thanks for the invitation, Tom
Sometimes you're so irritating
It's yours for the asking, Tom
It's time you got back to work
It wasn't your fault, you know
I'm sure Tom will be very busy
I'm here just for the holidays
You're not very busy, are you?
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not a very nice person
You're no longer welcome here
You're full of surprises, Tom
You're all hungry, aren't you?
You're about three weeks late
You're a very beautiful woman
You'll feel better in no time
You'd better do what Tom says
You should've seen Tom's face
You should've listened to Tom
You said that Tom wasn't busy
You need a good night's sleep
You must be a friend of Tom's
You could've gone by yourself
Why wasn't that in the report?
Why isn't Tom saying anything?
Why isn't Tom doing something?
Why does this have to be done?
Why aren't you in your office?
Why are you doing this for us?
Where's your bulletproof vest?
Where were you this afternoon?
Where is Tom now?
Do you know?
When did you and Tom buy that?
What're you doing with my car?
What're you doing in my house?
What're Tom and Mary planning?
What were you doing in Boston?
What is it that you want, Tom?
What is it that we have to do?
What do you do for relaxation?
What did Tom say he was doing?
What are your recommendations?
We're the only Canadians here
We're ready for the next step
We're in this together, right?
We'll need you in a few hours
It didn't rain
Tom's not answering his phone
Tom wasn't there this morning
Tom wasn't expecting any help
Tom was in Boston in 2003
Tom tried, but couldn't do it
Tom took Mary's glass of wine
Tom tied Mary's shoes for her
Tom shouldn't have interfered
Tom says he's good at cooking
Tom says he doesn't know Mary
Tom said he'd be leaving soon
Tom said he didn't feel tired
Tom loved you very much, Mary
Tom is wearing John's T-shirt
Tom hasn't been well recently
Tom hasn't been busy recently
Tom doesn't seem tired at all
Tom doesn't like this one bit
Tom doesn't like me very much
Tom doesn't like me that much
Tom doesn't know what that is
Tom doesn't know Mary is here
Tom doesn't have long to wait
Tom doesn't have a girlfriend
Tom doesn't even know my name
Tom doesn't eat a lot of meat
Tom doesn't appear to hear us
Tom didn't show up for dinner
Tom didn't look like a doctor
Tom didn't know that happened
Tom didn't have a sore throat
Tom didn't go to the hospital
Tom didn't give Mary a choice
Tom didn't get what he wanted
Tom didn't expect this at all
Tom didn't care what Mary did
Tom couldn't be with us today
Tom could've figured that out
Tom considered Mary's request
Tom and Mary haven't left yet
Tom and I'll be here all week
They say they've already paid
The fundraiser was Tom's idea
That was your plan, wasn't it?
That never should've happened
Thanks for understanding, Tom
Thank you for doing this, Tom
My flight arrived at 2:30 p.m
Mary isn't wearing any makeup
Mary doesn't have a boyfriend
It's time to leave for school
It's time for your medication
It's only a three-hour flight
It's not like you to complain
It's good to have you with us
It's a great day for a picnic
It'll be hard to persuade Tom
It'll be hard to convince Tom
It was your mistake, not mine
It didn't have to be that way
I'm waiting for Tom to return
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you
I'm originally from Australia
I'd like to meet Tom's sister
I think it's about time to go
I knew that Tom wasn't hungry
I hate it when you're so busy
I guess I'm not all that busy
I don't want to tell Tom that
I don't usually ask questions
I didn't need to go to Boston
How long's Tom been in Boston?
How did you do on your finals?
Doesn't Tom ever wear a watch?
Doesn't Tom ever wear a shirt?
Do you understand your orders?
Do you remember what happened?
Do you know how to pick locks?
Do you agree with that or not?
Do we have to do this tonight?
Do we have to do this anymore?
Do we have milk in the fridge?
Can't you do that on your own?
Aren't you from the consulate?
Are you saying Tom is a thief?
Are you making Tom a sandwich?
Are you and your sister close?
You've had all week to study
You're wearing my shirt, Tom
You're fifteen minutes early
You're busy here, aren't you?
You're beginning to scare me
You were my best friend, Tom
You never liked Tom, did you?
You hate your job, don't you?
You hate the idea, don't you?
You don't look all that busy
Will someone read me a story?
Why is Tom wearing a name tag?
Why did you disobey my order?
Why can't I have my own room?
Why aren't you with the kids?
Why aren't Tom and Mary here?
Why are you in your bathrobe?
What's the price of a ticket?
What're you doing with those?
What're you doing in my room?

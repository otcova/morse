It's likely to rain today
This is my teammate, Tom
We'll work with you
Apparently, Tom is sick
That's not the plan
Can I have some more candy?
We're all satisfied
Tom was surprised, too
It didn't make sense to me
Are Tom and Mary dating?
That's not the same
We're all taxpayers
Couldn't you help me first?
It sounds cool, doesn't it?
I don't want to fight Tom
We're desperate now
That's pretty clear
Are you and Tom enemies?
Do you want to see my boat?
It's easier than I thought
We're going to stay
I'd like to talk with Tom
I'll show you the ropes
That's pretty scary
It's finally time to leave
Did Tom really hit Mary?
What's the commotion about?
We're great friends
I'll turn on the lights
I'm just a pencil pusher
I didn't ask him to dance
Did you say thank you?
It's my job to help people
My neighbor's name is Tom
That's pretty weird
We're not in Boston
Tom brushed Mary's hair
What's the reason for this?
Don't tell Tom and Mary
I'm all right with that
It'll be fine tomorrow, too
We're not ready yet
That's quite a list
Oh!
It's beautiful!
They're back at it again
How is the weather outside?
It's a beautiful day outside
Really?
Are you serious?
I hope you'll be happy here
Have you seen my red tie?
We don't have all day
What did he say exactly?
What did she say exactly?
I don't remember his last name
I'm glad everyone is OK
What's this thing used for?
It'll be winter before long
We're not satisfied
I'm losing faith in you
That's really crazy
It'll rain in the afternoon
When did you guys get here?
We're not surprised
I'm not good at singing
Tom didn't even show up
It's impossible to describe
That's really nasty
We're not the enemy
Tom didn't get up early
Where are the strawberries?
We're here to support Tom
I'm not paid to do that
Tom didn't stay with us
It's nice to be appreciated
We're not yet there
Tom didn't stop talking
That's really scary
I've been writing a lot
Where did I put the hammer?
Tom didn't study at all
It's not very far from here
We're playing cards
I hope that won't happen
That's self-evident
It doesn't happen very often
Whose phone number is this?
We're proud of that
Have you ever even met Tom?
It must've happened that way
That's simply wrong
We're ready to help
Why do you still have this?
I'll write a letter to Tom
We're ready to play
That's way too much
What did Tom want to do?
Are you from Boston as well?
I'm a geologist
I know he's hiding something
I know she's hiding something
I am Hungary-born
They are Hungary-born
I didn't sleep on the plane
To a king dead, a king posted
I'm gonna leave her a tip
I'm gonna leave him a tip
I'm turned on
You don't value me
What are you telling me?
You're going?
I haven't decided on it yet
Do you know that person?
Don't ever do that to me again
It'll be fine this afternoon
Tom is cross-eyed
We're really afraid
I'm not nervous around Tom
That's what love is
It'll probably snow tomorrow
Where can Tom have gone?
Can we play a little longer?
We're still nervous
It's your color!
Now it's my brother's turn
Tom's warned me about that
How do I fix this problem?
We're both named Thomas
I don't know the cause
They're lucky
It'll soon be breakfast time
I'm really excited for Tom
That's what they do
We're still stunned
Did you just call me a jerk?
Did Tom really come back?
It's hard to know what to do
That's what we want
Yes, I am Brazilian
No, I don't like carnival.
My neighbour's name is Tom
I'm not going to die today
Ain't nobody got time for that
Dude, step off!
I knew this was a dream!
We're the good guys
Do I really need to do that?
Is your brother's name Tom?
I'm good at those things
Does Tom have a computer?
We're tired of this
Do you remember saying that?
I'm not excited about it
The cops won't find you there
It's not too hard to do that
The news isn't good
We're truly worried
Do you want me to finish it?
Does Tom have green eyes?
I'm not going to compete
Tom is pig-headed
We're trying to win
How could you be so certain?
We'll certainly invite Tom
I haven't read this book
I'm not going to read it
It'll cost you thirty dollars
Does Tom want to go home?
They aren't all bad
We've done no wrong
Why don't you say something?
I'm trying to do my best
It's a very expensive process
They aren't doctors
We've done our work
Will you tell the truth now?
Has Tom been watching TV?
I couldn't think straight
It's now time for you to rest
They aren't farmers
We've not done well
Was there anybody in the car?
Has Tom really come back?
They aren't like us
We've prepared well
Tom isn't Mary's friend
What happened to my suitcase?
I don't like that anymore
Tom isn't a good choice
It wouldn't be wise to do that
We're all going to miss Tom
They aren't related
Tom isn't as fast as me
What's so special about that?
I don't want this anymore
Tom isn't at all stupid
It'll stop raining before long
We can't forget that
Tom isn't ready to quit
Are you doing that on purpose?
We're not going to fire Tom
Tom wouldn't allow me to leave
Tom isn't working today
It's about time we get started
They didn't do much
We didn't believe it
Can't we play a little longer?
They didn't do that
It's very difficult to do that
Did everyone have a good time?
Tom knew I wasn't happy
They didn't fool us
I haven't had dessert yet
Did you do that intentionally?
They didn't give up
Do you think you can catch me?
They didn't know me
Is the supermarket still open?
We haven't done well
They didn't succeed
What are you guys waiting for?
We don't know much about Tom
They helped me, too
Tom should've stayed in Boston
What in the world is going on?
I'll be staying at Tom's
Why are they doing this to me?
We weren't talking about Tom
I'll visit Tom next week
They're all excited
We'll do what's best for Tom
I'm speaking with the director
I don't speak his language
I don't speak her language
We shouldn't give up
They're all serious
They're aware of it
We think it's unfair
We've learned a lot from Tom
Tom knew he couldn't save Mary
That's none of your beeswax
It's none of your beeswax
That's not bad at all!
Who took me here?
They're coming home
Shall I ask Tom for help?
We waited until 2:30
They're doing great
They're good enough
Should I ask Tom to help?
They're like family
Tom hasn't ever studied French
They're never happy
This is Tom's dictionary
Life is short, so I use Python
They're never there
They're nice people
I don't want to fight with Tom
They're normal kids
I'll never run away again
They're not doctors
I'll tell you what to buy
They're not farmers
Tom still can't go home
We know Tom didn't do it
They're not like us
I'll wait a little longer
Tom doesn't respect his father
They're not related
We weren't very good
I've been practicing hard
We'll try to do that
Tom wanted to come, too
They're our leaders
I've got a lot of friends
What did Tom want to buy?
They're paying rent
Tom and Mary haven't eaten yet
We're a happy family
I've had a very busy week
Tom would've loved this place
They're pretty loud
Tom was elected in 2013
He's a complete joke
She's a complete joke
They're a complete joke
We're a complete joke
It's a complete joke
It's rigged
If not..
I have not, and you know it.
Yes, you have
You're scum
I'm a huge fan of cat videos
Will do.
Oh, I have to be off.
Thanks.
Oh, you're a millionaire?
That's nice
Wow, really?
Good for you!
I'm really happy for you.
Don't get me started!
You're obsessed
We're obsessed
They're obsessed
I'm obsessed
He's obsessed
She's obsessed
We're not going to talk to Tom
We're being cautious
Tom was late, as always
They're pretty sick
Are you Tom by any chance?
I assume that won't happen
They're proud of me
We're being laid off
We're really going to miss Tom
I can't help you this week
They're quite sharp
Tom was very, very busy
We're both very busy
I don't recognize that guy
We've had a hard time with Tom
We're not doing that
It's Friday today
I'd like to withdraw money
What's the admission charge?
Can I take a photo?
It's Thursday today
Did you hear Tom's speech?
We're not the police
That'll help me a lot
I know that it's the truth
That's a strange idea
We're out of control
That's all quite true
We're ready for that
How does Tom go to school?
I see you've been shopping
It'll be cold
How did you manage to do this?
We're ready, I think
Tom won't come, will he?
I simply don't believe you
Tom isn't the man for the job
That's what's so scary
Tom won't do the dishes
Tom isn't afraid to work hard
We're really excited
I woke up 5 minutes ago
Sorry - I’m running late
I’ll be there in 10 minutes!
I couldn't disagree more.
Let's split the bill.
I don't think so
This date was your idea.
The job isn't done yet
Tom can't be fired
I still can't explain that
Tom isn't afraid of hard work
There's so much to see
Tom is the team's best scorer
We're really pleased
Tom wouldn't believe us
We're still in shock
I wish I hadn't been there
I often go to Tom's house
That law isn't enforced
We're trying to help
That's a fantastic idea
Tom's family is rich
That's quite interesting
Tom's clothes are dirty
We're very concerned
Tom's hair is very long
I'm having an awesome time
There's a fire downtown
We're very confident
I'm hoping to do just that
They aren't our enemies
I'll leave when Tom comes
They don't speak French
We're very selective
They're going to Boston
I'm known for oversleeping
That happened to us, too
That isn't a good reason
We're waiting for it
I'm only telling the truth
That's not a good reason
Tom can drive a car, too
That's pretty incredible
That's what was going on
I'm pretty angry right now
Should I ask Tom for help?
We've improved a lot
I'm really tired right now
I didn't read the message
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
This isn't a good reason
This happened to us, too
And are you happy now?
Are you convinced?
I'll kick your head off
Hurry up already!
Who found my wallet?
That's not Tom
That's John
Tom should've asked for help
We haven't forgotten that
Tom should've gone weeks ago
We hope that you're ready
Tom should've won last night
We know we're a good team
We've made too many mistakes
Tom shouldn't be too worried
Tom still doesn't believe it
Who was he?
Who's sick?
Were you hurt?
We're fine now
Will this work?
We'll enjoy this
We didn't want it
We don't care why
We won't quit now
We won't stop now
We'll be prepared
We'll do the same
We'll manage this
We'll never do it
We'll remain here
We're a lot alike
We're all stunned
We're all winners
We're all worried
We're here to win
We're not doctors
We're out of work
We're so grateful
We've made a deal
What a bad looser!
What a sweet deal!
What a total mess!
What should I get?
What's down there?
When did it occur?
When did it start?
Whose dog is this?
Why would I worry?
Would you stop it?
You won't miss it
You're only human
We're not students
Why should I worry?
We'd better do that
We'll be back later
What a rude comment!
Who'll pay for that?
Why bother fixing it?
Happy birthday, my little one!
It can't be today
Don't expect charity from them
God damn it!
Why's that important?
You wouldn't like it
Why did you interfere?
Your house is on fire!
We'll help you do that
What did Tom want me to do?
Whose computer is this?
We didn't do much today
We didn't need any help
We haven't given up yet
We'll never forget that
Where should we go next?
I've never ran before
I'm saving up for a new car

When is the party going to be?
Don't be such a party pooper
Do you enjoy comedy TV shows?
Where did you get your shirt?
Where did you buy your pants?
Where did you get those shoes?
Who was your first crush?
What was your first date like?
You're a complete idiot
We'd better do that soon
We're not as fast as you
We've stopped doing that
You're my favorite girl
She can't be right
I'm prettier than her
She's not as pretty as I am
She's not as short as I am
I'm cooler than her
Can you do my hair for me?
Can I have some soda, please?
May I have a napkin?
It's not as simple as it seems
I've never dyed my hair before
Who did you give that to?
Why are you following us?
Why should anyone be mad?
Do you think this'll work?
We didn't want to do that
We probably won't do that
We'll die if we stay here
We'll do the same for you
We'll never do that again
We're all aware of it now
We're always very careful
We're glad you're with us
We're just being cautious
We're never going to quit
We're not fortune tellers
We're now doing just that
We're on a rescue mission
We're pretty good friends
We're really, really fast
We've been lied to before
We've been very fortunate
We've got a big job to do
We've got more work to do
We've got several options
We've made no changes yet
We've offered our support
I, too, am not a student
Why do we have to do that?
You're way faster than me
We aren't burning anything
We couldn't make it happen
We didn't have a plan then
We didn't want to hurt you

Nonsense!
What could possibly go wrong?

You can't possibly be serious
I translate, therefore I am
We haven't had dessert yet
We haven't made a deal yet
We haven't made a sale yet
I didn't ask Tom to dance
We shouldn't have given up
We think it's a great idea
Which one do you like more?
Who do you like more?
Why don't you say anything?
We weren't able to do that
We weren't cautious enough
We won't go back to Boston
We won't have to wait long
We'd be foolish to do that
We'd like to consider that
We'd like to know about it
We'll always remember that
We'll continue cooperating
We'll do it right away
We'll do what we always do
We'll do whatever it takes
We'll get there eventually
We'll take what we can get
We're adding a lot of jobs
We're all working together
We're both French teachers
Good-bye
We're concerned about that
We're extremely optimistic
We're grateful to be alive
We're keeping an eye on it
We're making some progress
We're not burning anything
We're not doing that again
We're not going to give up
We're skeptical about this
We're still considering it
We're willing to negotiate
We've all got to do better
We've already discussed it
We've become like brothers
We've been here since 2013
We've been here three days
We've been very successful
We've been working on this
We've got a lot of friends
We've got to do that again
We've had a lot of chances
We've had a lot of support
We've just got to go do it
We've known that for years
We've made lots of changes
We've met some nice people
We've never broken the law
We've still got work to do
We've tried to do too much
Today there's a full moon
When did you lose your job?
Who should we talk to next?
Why should anyone be angry?
You'd be a fool to do that
You'll probably enjoy this
You're an excellent writer
You're much faster than me
You're way smarter than me
We don't have any ice cream
We don't know how to use it
We don't know what it means
We have about 300 employees
We have to be cautious, too
Am I really sick?
I'm two years younger than him
He didn't pay anything
He doesn't have his own ideas
He's the oldest of my group
Does Tom help Mary?
You can't smoke in school
It's very obvious
Tom isn't capable of doing it
Does Tom live in Boston?
We haven't decided anything
We haven't had any problems
We haven't seen this before
We just hope we'll get paid
We know our work isn't done
There's a full moon today
I'm sorry for reproaching you
Ah, cruel Three!
We now know that's not true
I'm a special person?
Thanks. ;)
I'm hungry
I'm going to eat something
Can I speak with the director?
He's going to work by bicycle
Change the channel!
Don't put that on the table
I'll give you my car
He's a glutton
Don't be afraid, I'm here
Seen any movies lately?
You waited for me?
Thanks!
She's the boss around here
Have you grown to despise me?
Let's have a little fun
Let's have a little fun
I don't speak Hungarian
Were you up all night?
We weren't paying attention
We weren't wasting our time
We won't know until October
We wouldn't change anything
We'll do a little at a time
We'll do what we have to do
We'll forgive you this time
We'll try to do what we can
We're all hoping it happens
We're both college students
We're both very, very lucky
We're doing something right
We're finalizing our budget
We're going to look into it
We're going to make it work
Look, a squirrel
It's getting cold here
It's starting to get cold here
We're going to take it slow
We're just following orders
We're never going to get it
We're not going to stop now
We're not prepared for that
We're pretty busy ourselves
We're proud of our children
We're real excited about it
We're sorry for what we did
We're surprised and shocked
Can you find Iraq on a map?
Can you find Eritrea on a map?
We're trying to do our best
We're very proud of you all
We've all been there before
We've already learned a lot
We've been here for a while
We've corrected the problem
We've done that in the past
We've got no room for error
We've got to finish on time
We've had a lot of bad luck
I don't trust Tom anymore
I can't trust anyone anymore
You shouldn't trust anyone
It's too early to call Tom
We've had a lot of practice
We've had good luck with it
We've had lot of complaints
We've made a lot of changes
We've still got a lot to do
These colors aren't enough
When do you plan to do that?
You're much smarter than me
You're way faster than I am
The pound is down by 15%
Who else have you asked?
Go away, Tom
I don't want to talk to you
We don't want you to do that
We have almost 300 employees
Do I look like an actress?
Can I come inside?
How are we going to fix this?
Can I see that credit card?
Can I see that debit card?
I'm going to teach you German
We're going there alone
You shouldn't have invited him
I call the computer "Tim
I'd like a little more tea
Why is life so hard?
We can't cut down that tree
Can I borrow some money?
I promise I'll pay you back.
How much do you need?
Twenty dollars.
Here you go.
Thanks.
We haven't achieved much yet
Don't forget to tip the waiter
How much should we tip him?
How much should we tip her?
I just can't help it
It's in my blood
I can't decide that for you
We know how that'll work out
You've got it all wrong
My name is Mary, what's yours?
What's yours?
Listen, Tom
You've got it all wrong
That's not my strong suit
Tom made a papier-mâché mask
Tom's a party animal
You're completely useless
He's your son, too
She's your daughter, too
Let me know when it's done
So, will you do it?
You'll ruin your mascara
You'll ruin your mascara.
Don't worry, it's waterproof.
I'll see you down at the beach
Did you really just say that?
Did he really just say that?
Did she really just say that?
We know what we've got to do
We must be getting home, too
What was he doing exactly?
What was Tom doing exactly?
What was she doing exactly?
I'd say yes if I were you
I'd say no if I were you
He didn't kiss me
She didn't kiss me
Tom, please, not now
Mary, please, not now
What else did you two do?
How did you and Dad meet?
How did you and Mom meet?
Stop repeating yourself!
Tom's a charmer
I won't say anything to anyone
Let's go back to the party
You promised!
Why is Tom mad at you?
Why is Mary mad at you?
You promised you'd come
You promised you'd be there
We are level-headed
You are level-headed
Tom is level-headed
I am level-headed
He's just a crazy old fool
He's just a crazy old man
We should finish by 2:30 p.m
We shouldn't expect too much
You're going to need it
It's not what I meant to say
We should've played harder
We think that's a good thing
I think I'll give it a miss
I think I won't do that
We'd be crazy if we did that
We'll be back here next year
I'm not a student either
We'll be fine no matter what
We'll go now if you're ready
We'll have to be ready to go
We'll have to fight, I think
We'll help in any way we can
I work very little..
I'd like to work more
He's an author you should know
He's a vegetarian
We'll start tomorrow morning
We're actually quite similar
We're all a little bit crazy
We're all basketball players
We're all trying to help you
What is a language?
We're always doing something
We're both going to be there
We're definitely not perfect
We're doing it the right way
We're extremely disappointed
We're finally going to do it
We're getting ready for that
We're going to find out soon
We're going to have fun, too
We're going to take our time
We're just about ready to go
We're keeping an eye on that
We're keeping an eye on them
We're never going to do that
We're not doing anything now
We're not done with this yet
We're not going to back down
We're not going to be afraid
We're not going to stop here
We're not sure what it means
I don't want to interrupt
You don't snore, do you?
It's just a stupid rumor
We're obviously short-handed
We're on the right track now
We're open seven days a week
We're the best at what we do
We're trying to find out why
Can I go to my room now?
What are you doing here?
We're very happy to be alive
Tom's death broke Mary's heart
We're very lucky to be alive
We've been very good friends
We've come to an arrangement
I swear I'll make it up to you
We've done that work for you
Tom went to his parents' place
We've got a pretty good team
Tom went to his parents' house
We've got to do a lot better
We've got to finish this job
We've got to fix some things
We've just got to get better
We've just got to keep going
We've learned that that's OK
We've made many improvements
We've never been here before
We've never done that before
What happened to your guitar?
Tom usually won't speak French
Tom tried to poison Mary's dog
Where exactly did you put it?
Who did you go swimming with?
You really just don't get it
You'd better not tell anyone
You're much faster than I am
You're way smarter than I am
We didn't get much done today
We don't have school tomorrow
Tom should've gotten a warning
We don't know who's out there
We don't talk about that here
Oh dear!
Tom can't work this evening
Do you deliver?
Don't slip
What am I?
I'm not in on Sunday
He's as tall as me
Where's the nearest shop?
What did you wish for?
It's a secret.
We haven't done that all year
We haven't done this in years
We haven't had any complaints
We haven't heard anything yet
We haven't made any deals yet
We haven't talked for a while
We haven't used it in a while
Tom knew who Mary's father was
We hope you're in good health
We just can't keep doing that
You don't need to talk to Tom
Why wasn't Tom here yesterday?
We just don't know enough yet
Why is Tom trying to scare me?
We just don't know what it is
Who swims faster, Tom or Mary?
We just don't think it's cool
Who did Tom go to Boston with?
Where exactly did you see Tom?
What train is Tom arriving on?
We don't want Tom on our team
Tom's place is easy to get to
Tom's house is near the beach
Tom's children are downstairs
Tom's car is stuck in the mud
We know how it's going to end
Tom's answer stunned everyone
We know it won't happen again
We know it's important to you
Tom worked for Mary's husband
We know we're capable of that
What's the point of school?
You don't pull any punches
Tom will win, don't you think?
We know what we're capable of
We know what we're up against
Tom will come on October 20th
We know you'll do what's best
Tom wasn't allowed to do that
How much does an egg cost?
How much do eggs cost?
We've just got to keep talking
We really don't have a choice
Tom visited Australia in 2013
I'm not as rich as you are
We still haven't seen one yet
We think we've got that fixed
He's okay
What's the fun in this?
We want to help, but we can't
Tom sang Mary's favorite song
We wish we could've done more
We won't allow this to happen
We won't know until next year

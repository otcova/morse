What do they need to buy?
What a beautiful city!
I still miss it..
I'd never hurt anyone
I'd refuse to do that
We're not on the list
Tom said he'd come and he did
Is this your brolly?
I don't accept gifts
We're not yet perfect
Good stegosaurus!

Tom showed up at 2:30
I should've trusted you
We shouldn't be outside
We're not the murderers
We're not very busy yet
We're not yet convinced
You shouldn't back down
Wow, what are you doing?
I'd be a fool to do that
I'd never go there alone
I'd never wait that long
Do you see that garden?
I'd do that if I had time
I'd like to see you there
We're not quite there yet
We're not sure what to do
We're not very hungry yet
You'd be tough to replace
I can count on you, I hope
I can rely on you, can't I?
Here's Johnny!
There wasn't any time for it
I'd be hesitant to do that
I'd probably do that again
We're not scared of anyone
I should get a dog, I think
I'd be perfect for that job
I'm used to such situations
We're not afraid of anybody
We're not entirely helpless
We're not in danger, are we?
She's a beanpole
We're not yet out of danger
You'd help us, wouldn't you?
Well?
I don't know what possessed me
I'd do that whenever I could
I'd get angry if you did that
I'd like you to be on my team
I'll ring him before I go
I'd probably be able fix that
The neighbour's just got back
Where to begin?
Where to begin?
It's not always easy to decide
Why on earth do you say that?
Can you wait for an hour?
Time's going by slowly today
He'll walk
He's going to walk
He'll go on foot
He's going to go on foot
It's going to be a hot day
It can't happen immediately
That was weird, wasn't it?
Everything's already been said
Why hasn't he bought it yet?
It's five past eleven
Is the film subtitled?
Does the film have subtitles?
Has the film got subtitles?
Why is that important to you?
They won't turn a deaf ear
They won't refuse to listen
It won't stay like this
It won't stay like that
What's gone wrong there?
What went wrong there?
What's up with Tom today?
Best give him a wide berth.
We're not leaving for a while
I'm not as stubborn as Tom.
Not as stubborn?
Everyone thinks that, John
Everyone!
He's going to eat an apple!
I shouldn't go there by myself
I'd be a good teacher, I think
She's expecting twins
How do I validate my card?
I'm in a hurry
Sorry!
I'm very ticklish
Can I touch them?
Does anyone know?
Mum, when will we arrive?
Did you receive them?
Actually, I don't know
Tom, my pleasure
Do I have time until tomorrow?
Where's the register?
Did you write him a letter?
We are out of milk!
There's no reception here
Hurry!
The bus is coming!
This is everything you have?
Well yes!
This isn't funny at all
What were you doing?
Nothing important.
Only if it were true!
What is his goal?
I don't hear a noise
I know, but I can't help
Are you still over there?
We're expecting visitors
Forget!
It's mandatory!
Do you have a sewing machine?
Same to you!
Here, done
Eat slowly!
Bet?
I like the toys!
Win a toy!
Good work, boys!
Oops, wrong!
It's getting serious!
Close the page!
He's not as naive as he looks
Where's the closest shop?
Tom doesn't have money
He isn't a hiker
I want to see you!
Tom didn't want to calm down
I will be happy forever!
You can swim, right?
They didn't like this game
They don't like this game

It came out as 150 grams
Should I leave it like that?
It's washing
You are going to get sick!
Isn't there reception here?
You haven't returned my change
What size shoes does he wear?
What size shoes does she wear?
We aren't going to get married
Let's start the translation!
Don't grin at me!
I don't want it
Did you receive it?
Only if I could!
Her father is an ex-convict
Congratulations" barked Tom
Do you know who won the race?
You can't leave us here!
Is everything OK, Tom?
I told you to wait in the car!
I won't enter here!
I can't see him anywhere
Lift your head up!
I don't have my keys
Should we make a bet?
I'm very pleased to see you
What size is it?
What do they want from him?
I'm asking just in case
Who agrees with me?
I'll stay here for a week
We won't miss you
We arrived at seven o'clock
What do they want from you?
Miss, you forgot your change!
Don't miss!
Children don't like to shower
Then I'll go through you
When can I take a shower?
Can we finish up here?
Can I have more milk?
Where are you going?
To a lecture.
That's another topic
Do we have to train?
Why are you putting that here?
What car do you drive?
Will you be leaving tomorrow?
Do you want milk and sugar?
There's a book on the table
You'd better get a move on
You'd better get a shift on
Do you go jogging every day?
Do you jog every day?
To eat in or take away?
To eat here or take away?
When are you getting up, then?
When are you going to get up?
She's a DJ
Thanks!
See you soon," she said
That's his own affair
Oh, that's better still
Oh, that's even better
Maybe he's seen her
Not half bad!
Did you bring the hairdryer?
It's too soon to discuss that
Don't confuse me for yourself
I'd never seen Tom so upset
If I were you, I'd wait
I'm scared, too
Mary says she's drunk
What is the name of that dog?
I'm from Sofia
Why are people never happy?
I haven't finished talking
Is he going back to Italy?
Do you have a white dress?
What time do you arrive?
Who is asking?
Don't pretend to be so open
No time!
I can't wait anymore
I'm going to do something!
What does "dog life" mean?
Do you have 5 cents?
What was I with then?
Do you remember?
Let's get tea!
I don't get paid for it
Did I give you a note?
I'm sure that Tom can help us
Is that so!
He won't believe us as well
Is that an eyelash in my soup?
We can't anymore!
Don't agitate the dog anymore
Who will convene the meeting?
Is something bothering you?
Where's the nearest crossroad?
How can I improve my French?
What time should I be there?
No, I am Fang Ning

Until then, wait here
Look, there goes a meteor
At what time should he ring?
At what time should she ring?
Were you always like this?
Don't chatter!
There's a phone in my room
I don't ask you for anything
Kids, we're eating
Children, we're eating
Can I go take a shower?
I'll get two of everything
Was that a compliment?
Hurry!
Is it very traumatising?
Did you catch a cold?
A Vienna schnitzel, please
I usually get up at 8:00
메리는 비가 오는 것을 좋아한다고 말했어요
That's not a horse
It's a donkey
Stop!
I can't take it anymore!
When can I come to you?
They don't have to train then
Are they the same breed?
Did you watch Tom's new clip?
I'll take two of everything
And what did you see?
We had already decided, right?
What do close people call you?
Don't throw away that magazine
I haven't read it yet
They don't suspect anything
I'm too lazy to travel
How's the bread?
You've been a great help to us
Let's do it one step at a time
I've decided to study medicine
I've read both of these books
I'm not involved
Actually, that's not true
I can't find the lighter
Actually, that isn't true
It's just started to snow
What'll we have to do?
What'll I have to do?
I didn't hear a sound
Do you ever call them?
Do you ever call him?
Do you ever call her?
I'll do what I think is right
We need to talk, Tom
Would you like a bag?
Don't overthink it!
He runs fast!
Good job!
Now this is something else!
You could've said a hi
I'm lost
Can you help me?
I'm on it right away!
Don't eat too much!
You could've greeted me!
What has be done until now?
You don't have a kitten?
How about a little coffee?
I don't understand the reason
The teacher doesn't teach
I'm not 150 cm
I'm aware of such things
I can imagine!
Good day Miss!
Enjoy your meal!
You too!
I'll think about this
Is it a new kind?
I don't know how to take this
Don't count me!
We won't succeed tonight
It's important that you answer
Send it to my e-mail
Hurry up or we'll be late
Did you turn off the TV?
Can I use your cellphone?
They don't like this book
Whew!
I’m dying of back pain
There's no running water
You are adorable!
You're adorable!
The symbol "&" means "and
I'm not Tom's mom
I'm his aunt
I like this Pokémon
I've never ridden Tom's horse
Well I don't know
Please don't interrupt!
What do they want from her?
I'm going out to see Ana soon
I think you're in Tom's way
Why are you telling this joke?
What are you waiting for?
Write to her!
I've been protecting Tom
I think that it's strange
I'll get arrested
I got Tom's message
It's no good talking about it
I'm awfully lazy
It's time you went to bed
It's fun to play cards
Is the universe infinite?
We don't know
And that's why I'm writing you
It's so puzzling
Where are my notebooks?
Do you know this one?
Do you love learning French?
I didn't really know
I don't like it a bit
That's a very bad habit
I don't know how it's spelled
You don't like anything
Are you still with us, Tom?
I'll take a nap, I guess
We don't know the reason
Experts don't really know
I’m not going to stir
He wasn't embarrassed
She wasn't embarrassed
I don't want to leave now
Who won the match?
I didn't visit Russia
I didn't visit Argentina
I’m in China
We didn't visit Malta
There's an end to everything
You aren't a hero
You've got fat
I don't see
You're recovering
We're returning
Don't let go!
Do they need to finish?
What do you work?
Stop drinking so much!
He will never hang up!
Oh!
Is it comfortable like this?
I'm waiting for the bus to go
Should we go out tonight?
He's throwing everything away
Don't act dumb!
We're really done!
He's taking a shower right now
Ivan, what's your nickname?
It's important you answer
Hello teacher!
He's coming for help
Thank you, this is all
Drink one for me!
How do you know what's right?
They don't know my real name
You know, that's interesting
This tree is remarkable!
Hitch the dumpcart to my nag!
We're eating bread
I want to go to Tom's party
I left Tom's office at 2:30
Are you, by any chance, Tom?
It's snowing harder
It's snowing heavier
The snow's getting harder
The snow's becoming heavier
The snow's getting heavier
We don't know how Tom died
He's switched the telly on
You don't seem to want us here
They wouldn't agree
You wouldn't agree
She wouldn't agree
He wouldn't agree
They've taken a day off
You've taken a day off
She's taken a day off
You're as tall as your father
You're going to lose the game
You're about to lose the game
Tom doesn't how to do that
I've never spoken with Tom
I'm going to see Tom soon
What has she done until now?
We're not here!
Come on now, get out of here!
Give me, I'll do it!
I don't know how I survived
That's a Japanese doll
I don't want to scare Tom
I haven't seen you in a week
My uncle's son is my cousin
But when will it happen to me?
Did you know Tom's mother?
I've brought Tom a gift
I'm sorry you think this way
I don't blame Tom a bit
Tom didn't know either
You don't agree with me?
I sold Tom a T-shirt
I hurt Tom's feelings
Do you like this type of book?
Tell Tom I'll be late
Tell Tom I'm going to be late
Tom doesn't deserve Mary
Mary doesn't deserve Tom
Mary is out of Tom's league
Mary's out of Tom's league
I couldn't reach Tom
I'll call Tom first
Languages don't work like that
It's very exhausting work
I read Tom's letter
I needed Tom's help
I liked Tom's video
I didn't sit by Tom
I'm not Tom's wife
I rode Tom's horse
There's no reasoning with them
I loved Tom's poem
I like Tom's smile
I'm not Tom's husband
I'm not Mary's wife
I'm Tom's husband
I'm Mary's wife
I know Tom's voice
I don't want to do the dishes
Tom won't know me
Don't drink the Kool-Aid
I think I'm too old for her
I don't come here often
I don't cook very often
I don't have a shirt on
I don't want to keep it
I won't cut any corners
I'm always getting lost
I don't have to help you
I won't pay you anything
I don't want to sell this
I've met your kind before
I'm constantly getting lost
I don't care if I win or not
Tom didn't have an accomplice
I'd like to eat lunch with you
I don't cook on Mondays
Don't look down!
Let it stop!
I'm not Mary's husband
What's the daily tariff
He's like his twin brother
I don't like melodramas
I'm waiting patiently
Is there a smaller size?
He couldn't find a job
My pleasure, Tom
I hadn't perforated my ticket
He didn't want to admit it
I'm happy I'm not the only one
There's too much traffic here
I told Tom I wouldn't go there
We didn't treat Tom well
Where did you stop?
I don't think Tom snores
Nobody is saying anything?
I'm sorry, but you are wrong.
Free the police dogs!
I won't lend money to anybody
That's implicit
Why didn't I get anything?
We've left
Don't kiss me!
Do you want a glass?
There's one on the table
Could you translate it for me?
I'm wearing my jacket
Is there ketchup?
I've passed the exam
I've passed the test
Fortunately, it isn't serious
I'm evil
I'm wicked
I'm not good for you
We don't know what caused it
Do we have any ketchup?
Is there any ketchup left?
How do you find that wine?
Of course it's true
Are you sitting now?
I went to Tom's room
I'll do this for Tom
I'll drive Tom there
What a sad state!
I'm still dating Tom
Oh!
I want Tom's opinion, too
Tom said he'd go there today
He couldn't find Mary's house
He's definitely at home
Don't scrimp on your health
What's lost is lost
Do you all agree?
What do you all think?
Did you all enjoy yourselves?
I'm glad you're going to come
That's wicked cool
That's hella cool
I reckon that's true
I reckon I'll go
I hope he'll help us
How do you get there?
I don't know these women
I don't know these ladies
But don't get me wrong
It's difficult to do this
Do you ever get a headache?
I hope you didn't get hurt
Where can we get some food?
Will the situation get worse?
We couldn't get there quickly
Will they tell me the truth?
I'm wiping my face
Did you really need to walk?
How long do cats live?
How long do dogs live?
Do you think we have a chance?
Sorry, I was thinking
I didn't read the rest
I don't like small dogs
I'm playing
It doesn't bode well
It doesn't augur well
You've got broad shoulders
They've got broad shoulders
Normally I'm punctual
I'm normally on time
It wasn't very warm last night
Last night wasn't very warm
Yes, that's right
Haven't you got a telly?
Haven't you got a television?
Don't you have a telly?
Don't you have a television?
Where do we have to change?
Where have we got to change?
I've finally learnt
I can finally ride a bike!
Let's see then, Tom!
Hop on and ride it a bit!
I've finally learnt
I can finally ride a bike!
Let's see then, Tom!
Grandad!
I can finally ride a bike!
With stabilisers?

Why aren't you talking to him?
What do I want to talk about?

How long does a cat live?
Who was at home?
We should stop dithering!
Some tea?

Who invented paper?
Do you know them in person?
Don't jest!

Is or isn't there?
Does he have it or not?
Does she have it or not?

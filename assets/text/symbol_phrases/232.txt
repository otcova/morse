Is Tom always like this?
Tom is sleeping, isn't he?
Tom didn't eat anything
I don't miss Tom a bit
That's 50 yen
I forgot to turn off the iron!
We all do, or we all should
He should!
God bless us!
Which all his family re-echoed
It's easy to sing
Is Tom singing?
Where do you sing?
How did Tom help?
Don't make me sing
Does Tom drink tea?
How could you help?
Don't let Tom sing
How would you help?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
I am so tired..
Were you satisfied?
Did Tom yell at you?
How can people help?
Did you yell at Tom?
Is there a youth hostel here?
Don't watch television!
Thanks, that is all
It wasn't a real kiss
It wasn't my first kiss
I shouldn't have kissed you
That's just a guess
Can you help me find my keys?
Don't come too late to work
Does he have a normal pulse?
Have you washed your hands?
Can you pass me the olives?
Were you there, too?
Did Tom really dance?
You can't sing here
You could've called
Don't ask me to help
That isn't Tom's car
Hello parent!
Go to the top!
You're too crazy!
You!
Speak!
I'm going where?
You don't feel
Mary, come down
Where is your son now?
Where is your daughter now?
Where was I?
I'm feeling gloomy today
Don't bring your dog
Who's protecting Tom?
Did Tom say he helped?
They'll kill me!
What time is it?
It's 2:30.
What's the time?
It's 2:30.
Does Tom have to help?
Here's a better idea
Good luck to you, Tom
A beer for me, please!
I'm sure Tom can swim
That isn't difficult
Tell Tom I won't sing
That's another story
What was your intent?
Who did Tom sing with?
Come, let's chill!
What's his real name?
Even Tom couldn't help
What's the next step?
How could you help Tom?
It's a secret
You can't let anyone else know
You can't let anyone else know
Who won the election?
Please don't blame Tom
Who'll pay the bills?
Did Tom really help you?
We can't talk here
Let's go somewhere else
Why should they stop?
How is Tom able to help?
Wild birds fly!
Will you sing for me?
I didn't dance with Tom
Wow, what a surprise!
You can't go outside
You don't deserve it
I really don't know Tom
You're bound to fail
I'm sure Tom can't swim
You're quite correct
We can't let Tom escape
You're very ignorant
We couldn't protect Tom
With his arms, he dances
It's relatively expensive
It's only too true!
No one called for you!
You are simply unbearable!
Do they drink tea?
We're heading down a dead end
Yesterday, he saw a large man
Mom!
Stop!
Do you recognise this writing?
Did you rest?
Now, the last sprint begins
Well, it doesn't bother me!
Don't be shy, go ahead!
I don't drag them
Tell me the truth, Thomas
You won't escape me
You don't like this game
Life is too short, really!
Did Tom really kiss Mary?
We can't survive without water
Do you like this music?
Please don't smoke
Oh, how I miss you!
Good luck with that, Tom
Do I look pale to you?
How much did this cost?
Tom's smile vanished
Don't act like a jerk
Don't be fooled again
Have you ever been happy?
Are they Americans?
Don't forget the past
I've never heard Tom cry
Don't get left behind
Is Tom really happy here?
Don't tell anyone yet
Don't walk home alone
That isn't Tom's bicycle
Don't you feel hungry?
That isn't Tom's problem
We can't let Tom do that
Did Tom really drink that?
Why is this computer here?
That ain't going to happen
She doesn't have relatives
Tom is delirious!
I know Mary thinks I'm stupid
I know Mary thinks I'm dumb
I can't believe this is real
He's dirt-poor
That's not civil disobedience
That's rioting
Chill-out
So, what was it like?
You can't do that.
I just did.
You've covered your bases well
You're under arrest for murder
You're technically wrong there
You still haven't explained it
What you're feeling isn't real
We've set up offices in Boston
We've seen this time and again
We've seen this pattern before
We've really got our mojo back
We've had a really good season
We've had a number of injuries
We've got to find a way to win
We've got to be more proactive
We've got lots to do, you know
We've got a big game on Monday
We've been doing that all year
We're very happy with the news
We're trying to plan something
We're there with you in spirit
We're taking it to a new level
We're still as annoyed as ever
We're really proud of our kids
We're proud of the way we live
We're open to more suggestions
We're not turning anybody down
We're not trying to change you
We're not looking for converts
We're not here to assign blame
We're not going to let this go
We're not going to accept that
We're not asking for a handout
We're not all in the same boat
We're just going with the flow
We're in a miserable situation
We're happy everybody is alive
We're going to win this strike
We're going to set up shelters
We're going to lose everything
We're going to learn from this
We're going to do it this fall
We're going out again tomorrow
We're going after it right now
We're giving them the go-ahead
We're facing a profound change
We're exceedingly proud of you
We're children compared to you
We're asking you to talk to us
We're anticipating good things
We're always thinking about it
We're already well aware of it
We're almost like best friends
We'll meet this week in Boston
We'll meet again in the future
We'll get off with a reprimand
We'll alter our course at once
We'll all be sorry to lose you
We won't hold this against you
We won't hold that against you
We weren't fooled for a second
We were angry, but we'll be OK
We know there's a traitor here
We know there'll be challenges
We haven't yet determined that
We haven't reached the end yet
We haven't been close in years
We had to go back empty-handed
We can't anticipate the future
This wasn't an intentional act
This could've been devastating
They're expected to dress well
They're doing some good things
They're all in there somewhere
They didn't know what happened
They clearly know it's serious
There's uncertainty everywhere
There's no tangible connection
There's a double standard here
There just wasn't enough money
There haven't been any arrests
The lawsuit isn't yet resolved
The law wasn't always enforced
The answer is it's complicated
That's what makes them special
That's quite an understatement
That's going to help everybody
That's a very generous gesture
Surprisingly, I felt very safe
Soldiers are human beings, too
Rest assured they're out there
Preparation is what's required
Now you're piquing my interest
Nothing's wrong with my French
No wonder you're so indecisive
Most people don't realize this
Major surgery isn't the answer
Let's work to keep it that way
Let's say you're offered a job
Let's meet for a cup of coffee
Let's leave politics out of it
Let's enjoy this beautiful day
Let's assume that won't happen
Let's a keep on moving forward
It's very difficult to acquire
It's too complicated to answer
It's time for us to fight back
It's something you dream about
It's nothing but a stupid rock
It's not as depressing anymore
It's like a double-edged sword
It's interesting that you lost
It's getting better every week
It's exceeded our expectations
It's been a remarkable journey
It's always the parents' fault
It's a very dangerous strategy
It'll be a wonderful adventure
Is that what you're thinking?
I've spoken to people about it
I've really got to take charge
I've never seen so many lights
I've made a catastrophic error
I've had martial arts training
I've got three young daughters
I'm very comfortable with that
I'm surprised, but not shocked
I'm still trying to arrange it
I'm so sorry this has happened
I'm responsible for my conduct
I'm quite happy about that now
I'm pretty burnt out right now
I'm not really a coach anymore
I'm not in the least surprised
I'm not getting married at all
I'm not a rude person normally
I'm not Canadian
I'm Japanese
I'm just glad to be part of it
I'm just getting the runaround
I'm happy to be a part of this
I'm embarrassed enough already
I'm appalled by such ignorance
I'll thank you not to touch me
I'll tell you what I won't buy
I'll finish it when I get home
I'll complete my training soon
I'll buy you another one later
I'd consider that a real favor
I'd better get my act together
I wouldn't give it any thought
I wouldn't even think about it
I won't hold my breath waiting
I won't get into what happened
I won't buy this product again
I wish we'd found some weapons
I wasn't charged with anything
I usually don't talk this much
I think you're seriously wrong
I think you're being very rash
I think we're on the same page
I think we're in this together
I think that's the bottom line
I think that's all you can ask
I think it's clearly justified
I think it's a beautiful place
I see where you're coming from
I love everything you're doing
I know what you'll say to that
I know it's an amazing feeling
I just thank God that I'm free
I just can't put it into words
I hurt a few people's feelings
I hope you'll enjoy your leave
I haven't used checks in years
I haven't seen any of them yet
I have feelings, too, you know
I don't want to stir things up
I don't understand the context
I don't understand some people
I don't think we were confused
I don't think it's fair at all
I don't see how they could win
I don't quite feel at ease yet
I don't like waiting in queues
I don't know what I don't know
I don't have any proof of that
I don't follow baseball at all
I don't expect any quick fixes
I don't claim not to be a fool
I don't care what we call them
I don't care what race you are
I don't buy this report at all
I don't anticipate it stopping
I didn't make a fool of myself
I didn't listen to your speech
I didn't have any expectations
I didn't have a lot of support
I decided I couldn't sit still
I couldn't swing the golf club
I couldn't grow a mustache yet
I can't really argue with that
I believe we're moving forward
Hopefully they don't overdo it
Everyone had each other's back
Don't expect a coherent answer
Don't blame me for complaining
Censoring won't hide the truth
Boston wasn't built over night
Anything you've got would help
You've got to love technology
You're turning into a chicken
Tom knew that he'd be punished
Something's not right with Tom
You're the worst kind of snob
You're not very well informed
You're bound to be discovered
You're blinded by your hatred
You're an irresponsible idiot
You're a horrible human being
You'll have your own bathroom
You'll have to choose quickly
You needn't say anything more
With Tom, anything is possible
You know it's going to be fun
You haven't understood at all
You can't choose your masters
You can't blame them for that
We've got to quit lying to Tom
Will insurance premiums go up?
Why were we all summoned here?
We're extremely happy with Tom
Why do you not look surprised?
Who was the arresting officer?
Tom's trial started in October
Where's your next destination?
When's the next hunger strike?
Tom's time behind bars is over
What's wrong with the picture?
What's up with our government?
Tom's resume speaks for itself
What's the reason behind this?
What's the real priority here?
Tom's record speaks for itself
What's the big occasion today?
What's changed over the years?
Tom's position isn't yet clear
What would I do with a family?
What most defines a community?
Tom's parents weren't so lucky
What happened to that project?
What do you think of our list?
Tom's life changed drastically
What do you mean by dangerous?
What do I look like, an idiot?
Tom's family is very religious
What do I do in the meantime?
What challenges might we face?
Tom's enthusiasm has caught on
Were you doing something else?
We've never been disappointed
Tom's description was accurate
We've had a long relationship
We've done exceptionally well
Tom's body was found yesterday
We've been waiting for a year
We've been very happy with it
We've been around a long time
We're waiting for our lawyers
We're very lucky to have them
We're trying to work this out
Tom will get re-elected easily
We're trying to work that out
We're still a bunch of idiots
We're steadily moving forward
We're ready for the elections
We're not scared to go to war
We're not prepared whatsoever
We're not as free as we think
We're learning how to compete
Tom wasn't trying to hurt Mary
We're just along for the ride
We're investigating the facts
We're in it for the long term
We're in it for the long haul
We're in good shape right now
We're here because we're poor
We're going to try like crazy
We're going to need everybody
We're going to go beyond that
We're committed to innovation
We're as excited as we can be
We're all as committed as you
We're against nuclear weapons
We'll work every day from now
We'll never know for sure now
We'll know for sure next week
We'll keep you in our prayers
We'll have a delicious dinner
We'll be profitable this year
We'll always have differences
We wouldn't last five minutes
We were a hard-working family
We know we can't sustain that
We kept going and didn't quit
Tom searched Mary's room again
We hope that you won't freeze
Tom said he couldn't elaborate
Tom said Mary didn't look sick
We don't want to tip them off
We don't want a lot of things
We don't have to be so polite
We don't condone your actions
We didn't create the problems
Was this an arranged marriage?
Tom really couldn't believe it
Tom put poison in Mary's drink
Tom never doubted Mary's story
This could've been a disaster
They've cleared out the place
They're calling off the fight
They're calling it a homicide
Tom must've been unavailable
They'll think we cheated them
They shouldn't be allowed out
They just couldn't grasp that
They couldn't find that plane
There's plenty of stuff there
There's not enough jail space
There's more talk than action
There's a place for everybody
There just wasn't enough time
Tom knows he's vulnerable here
There aren't really any rules
There are other costs, though
Tom kept screaming Mary's name
Tom isn't running for governor
Tom isn't exactly welcome here
The symptoms haven't returned
Tom isn't a seasoned performer
The solutions aren't so clear
Tom is one of Mary's relatives
Tom is in jail, awaiting trial
The plot isn't that important
The owner couldn't be located
The museum is open year-round
The firing pin's been removed
Tom is a cold-blooded murderer
That's what's being discussed
That's what they're all about
That's what the country needs
That's what really angered me
That's starting to change now
That's really the only reason
Tom hasn't lost his confidence
That's privileged information
That's not very compassionate
That's how we do it in Boston
That's better than we thought
That's all anyone ever wanted
That's a lot more interesting
That's a dangerous assumption
That's a battle worth winning
That won't be necessary today
Tom has hair similar to Mary's
Tom has co-written three books
That clearly isn't true today
That changed suddenly in 2013
I don't like long journeys
The girl didn't say anything
Please don't hate me for this
Tom gripped Mary's arm tightly
One day I'm going to kill you
Many were injured, some badly
Tom doesn't speak for everyone
Tom doesn't believe in doctors
Let's slow down just a minute
Let's keep building airplanes
Let's just say it didn't work
Let's just say it didn't hurt
Tom didn't want to be a snitch
Let's join them in this fight
Let's hope that changes today
Tom didn't report Mary missing
Let's help those most in need
Let's have a cup of tea first
Tom didn't leave any witnesses
Learn how to drive, you moron
Kids wouldn't understand that
Tom didn't know how to proceed
It's time to change direction
It's not about cost reduction
It's not a volunteer position
Tom didn't have a wedding ring
It's just a great opportunity
It's beyond all comprehension
Tom didn't have a bank account
It's a very rewarding feeling
It's a very comfortable house
Tom didn't go looking for Mary
It wasn't an isolated problem
Tom didn't complete his degree
Tom didn't come to rescue Mary
Tom didn't come entirely clean
It was a life-changing moment
Tom didn't buy those arguments
It hasn't been widely adopted
Tom criticized Mary's approach
It didn't seem very effective
Tom couldn't live without Mary
It couldn't be more different
Tom couldn't cope with failure
Tom co-wrote a paper with Mary
Isn't that a little premature?
Is your home properly insured?
Tom certainly doesn't think so
Is this what you want as well?
Is there room for improvement?
Is that what you want from me?
Is that really how you see me?
Is surgery always recommended?
I've survived a lot of things
I've no proof to the contrary
I've never used a weed killer
I've never heard a frog croak
I've been praying all morning
I've been doing a lot of work
I've always been a Giants fan
I'm young, but I'm not afraid
I'm very proud of our company
I'm still waiting to find out
I'm so tired of the bickering
I'm ready for this to be over
Things didn't go right for Tom
I'm pretty open about my past
I'm paying most of your bills
There's nobody better than Tom
I'm on the point of giving up
I'm not going to sugarcoat it
There was a woman in Tom's car
I'm not going to stay forever
I'm not giving medical advice
The police came to Tom's house
I'm not feeling my age at all
I'm not asking for free stuff
I'm not all that into reading
I'm not afraid of electricity
That's when Tom began to panic
I'm more than a little scared
I'm looking for a better deal
That was Tom's number one rule
I'm living the American dream
I'm living my dream right now
Something has caught Tom's eye
I'm just not that interesting
I'm just happy being a farmer
Somebody knocked on Tom's door
I'm happy with the job I have
I'm going to scream right now
I'm going to pray a whole lot
I'm going to have fun with it
Only Tom saw the killer's face
I'm glad it's out in the open
I'm glad I participated in it
I'm focused on being governor
I'm confident we'll get there
I'm a veteran of the Gulf War
I'm a pretty frequent shopper
I'm a fan like everybody else
I'll tell you how I knew this
It was I who baptized you, Tom
I'll never forget that sunset
I'll let you know next Monday
I'll be near you all the time
I'll be homeschooling my kids
I've been with Tom a long time
I'd like to say they're wrong
I wouldn't say that right now
I'm coming right back with Tom
I wouldn't call them veterans
I wonder where the profits go?
I'm a little anxious about Tom
I think Tom would've killed me
I think we were well-prepared
I just hope Tom doesn't suffer
I think that's where we're at
I just couldn't figure Tom out
I think that's safe to assume
I think that's our obligation
I think that's most important
I think that's hard to answer
I haven't been honest with Tom
I think it's pretty fantastic
I suppose you won't deny that
I don't see Tom going anywhere
I still can't really hear you
I didn't get anywhere with Tom
I sincerely hope you're vegan
I couldn't bear to look at Tom
I say what other people won't
I can't but feel sorry for Tom
I really don't think it works
I really don't have an answer
I know we'll give it our best
I know it wasn't right for me
Don't worry about Tom just yet
I just don't see it happening
I just don't operate that way
I just didn't think about you
You have to admire Tom's guts
I hope this debate isn't over
I hope I'm not getting a cold
I hope I'll get off on Monday
Why is this a problem for Tom?
I haven't seen them for years
What would Tom want in return?
What kind of gun did Tom have?
We're not saying Tom is wrong
We're not saying Tom is right
I feel like I can't do enough
Tom, however, can't act alone
I don't want to lose my house
I don't want to get political
Tom's wife keeps him grounded
I don't think we're there yet
I don't think it's convincing
Tom's trial is about to begin
I don't sweat the small stuff
I don't see any more setbacks
Tom's suicide changes nothing
I don't need a nanny just yet
I don't know if I believe you
Tom's story is a familiar one
I don't know how I'll make it
I don't have any details here
Tom's personality has changed
I don't give a rip who did it
I don't get frustrated at all
Tom's parents weren't pleased
I don't feel sorry for myself
I don't even think about that
I didn't want to go overboard
I didn't take advantage of it
Tom's first love was baseball
I didn't get too tired at all
I didn't expect thanks anyway
Tom's family was conservative
I didn't even tell my parents
I didn't even bother to watch
Tom's facing an uphill battle
I didn't call them vigilantes
Tom's eyes were full of tears
I couldn't let my mother down
Tom's dog was found uninjured
Tom's computer was in his car
I can't wait to get new tires
I can't stand ignorant people
Tom's clothes are soaking wet
I can't live without my music
I can't let myself think that
Tom's adoptive father is John
I can't guarantee the outcome
I can't get my mind around it
I can't get it out of my head
I can't emphasize that enough
I can't deal with you anymore
I can't be around you anymore
Tom won't spend a day in jail
I bet the rates won't go down
Tom won't serve any jail time
Tom won't be easily dissuaded
How quickly can things change?
How do we reverse the process?
How can anyone criticize this?
How are other people managing?
Expectations aren't being met
Don't become attached to them
Does the government even care?
Does anyone know your secrets?
Does anybody notice a pattern?
Do you suffer from depression?
Do you share common interests?
Tom went back to Mary's house
Do you know why I can do that?
Tom wasn't so lucky this time
Tom wasn't expecting miracles
Can you help me sort this out?
Tom wasn't exactly a stranger
Can you believe we didn't win?
Can someone refresh my memory?
Tom wasn't even able to stand
Call me if you feel any worse?
Better late than never, right?
Are you already out of breath?
Are we going back to the ship?
You'll never break my spirit
You'll just be losing ground
I think you'll appreciate it
You'll find no argument here
You shouldn't have favorites
You haven't changed one iota
You can't protect me forever
You can't deceive us anymore
Would you like water or milk?
Would you get a look at that?
Tom was paroled again in 2013
Why won't you do what I want?
Why are people living longer?
Who's applying this pressure?
Who wouldn't watch that show?
Who helped the team the most?
Who cares where it's located?
Who built this thing, anyway?
What's your precise location
What's your average day like?
What's wrong with being sexy?
What's the concept all about?
What you're feeling is wrong
What would you want for them?
What would be the motivation?
What regulations would apply?
What if one of you gets hurt?
Then, you can refute it
This life is beautiful or not?
Could it be that I am crazy?
Warning, no obscenity
I think you're crazy
What has brought this change?
What exactly are the charges?
We've still got a month left
We've increased our manpower
We've had some bad luck here
We've had a lot of adversity
We've got to fix this system
Tom was first elected in 2013
We've got them over a barrel
We've got bigger fish to fry
Tom was elected mayor in 2013
We've consulted with experts
We've changed so many things
Get well!
We've been very conservative
We've been through it before
We've been struggling lately
We've been kidding ourselves
We're very much on top of it
We're used to not being home
We're still working that out
We're still paying attention
We're still clearing that up
We're starting to get it now
We're redoubling our efforts
We're real proud of our guys
We're playing well as a team
We're on the same page again
We're losing too much ground
We're looking for terrorists
We're like a big family here
We're just like best friends
We're in uncharted territory
We're in this thing together
We're in no hurry to do that
We're here to finish the job
We're here to demand justice
We're here for the long haul
We're going to put on a show
We're going to go after them
We're going to build on this
We're glad it all worked out
We're expecting some hiccups
We're expecting a busy night
We're due back in court soon
We're covering all our bases
We're checking for hepatitis
We're certainly not affluent
We're becoming too conceited
We're at the top of our game
We're as capable as they are
We're an advertising company
We're all trying to act cool
We'll try again next weekend
We'll take whatever you have
We'll meet here in this room
We'll be here when it's over
We'll always be here for you
We'd love to hear your story
We won't allow this to go on
We weren't always optimistic
We weren't able to save them
Tom thought he'd forgotten it
Tom supported Mary's children
We just don't have the money
We haven't yet done the work
We haven't turned a stove on
We haven't been informed yet
Tom still couldn't believe it
We don't see it as a problem
Was this ever tested for DNA?
Unfortunately, the baby died
To answer your question, yes
Tom says that's not the point
This obviously isn't working
This isn't a secret document
Tom says he doesn't like Mary
This isn't a laughing matter
Tom saw Mary's true potential
Tom said it's a positive step
Tom said he wasn't handcuffed
They're not coming after you
They're going to execute you
Tom said he isn't a candidate
They aren't involved in this
There's plenty of work there
There's nothing in the works
There's no right answer here
There's no disagreement here
Tom recognized Mary's glasses
There's more funding to come
There's good reason for that
There's barely enough for me
Tom realized he couldn't talk
There are other changes, too
The victim hasn't been named
The trend isn't looking good
Tom owns a high-powered rifle
The police can't do anything
The money isn't being wasted
The kids didn't see anything
The government can't do that
The children don't know that
That's why you're in college
That's why we're really here
That's what the show's about
That's what the law dictates
That's what many people said
That's what makes you strong
That's unusual on two counts
That's too close for comfort
That's super important to me
That's something to build on
Tom knows there's work to do
That's something I aspire to
That's really why we're here
That's pretty understandable
That's how we'll approach it
Tom knows it's more than that
That's how these things work
That's how it normally works
That's definitely part of it
That's a huge problem really
That's a good starting point
That's a challenge in itself
That'll discourage criminals
That'll be your top priority
Tom just didn't have the time
Tom isn't your typical pastor
That in itself isn't unusual
Tom isn't totally pessimistic
Tom isn't thinking about that
Tom isn't an elected official
Tom is the band's lead singer
Our children aren't to blame
Obviously, it's a big relief
Now, the situation is better
Now that's not very friendly
Now that's a retirement plan
Now that's a different story
Nobody's in favor of torture
Tom is destroying Mary's life
My dancing career isn't over
Music isn't really a science
Tom is banging at Mary's door
Let's talk about how and why
Let's step back for a second
Let's keep it in perspective
Let's give them more support
Just an apology isn't enough
It's too late to call it off
It's survival of the fittest
It's simply cause and effect
It's really different for me
It's not like I had a choice
It's not entirely unpleasant
It's more realistic that way
It's funny because it's true
It's easy to get cooperation
It's cause for major concern
It's an awesome organization
It's always important to win
It's a pretty amazing script
It's a lot of responsibility
It's a cause for celebration
It wasn't a happy experience
It was reconstructed in 2013
It doesn't require a battery
It couldn't be anything else
Tom hasn't been proven guilty
Isn't that at least possible?
Is this really your position?
Is this a conscious decision?
I've never seen it like this
I've never lacked confidence
I've never demanded anything
I've enjoyed a college a lot
I've been living like a monk
I've been doing that forever
I've been around a long time
I'm very upset at this point
I'm very proud of this bunch
I'm very proud of these guys
I'm very comfortable with it
I'm tired of people like you
I'm terribly ashamed of this
I'm sure it didn't come easy
I'm sorry it happened at all
I'm offended by your apology
I'm not very chatty, usually
I'm not unduly worried by it
I'm not sure that's the case
I'm not going to pay it back
I'm in favor of higher taxes
I'm in a good spot right now
I'm in a different place now
I'm going to prove you wrong
I'm going to focus on my job
I'm getting real comfortable
I'm fairly convinced of that
I'm excited about everything
I'm doing everything for you
I'm asking you not to forget
Tom has come a long, long way
I'm already a senior citizen
I'm about to push the button
I'll take the blame for that
I'll have to ponder this one
I'll get to that in a second
I'll change your tires later
Tom has been mayor since 2013

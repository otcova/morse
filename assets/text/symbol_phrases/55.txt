Dear comrades!
I'm in love with you, girl
I'll call you before I leave
Could you come to me tomorrow?
You'd rather call her!
Is Tom married or divorced?
He is married.
What was her hairdo like?
I wasn't paying attention.
Let's watch another movie
I had no idea where you'd gone
Unfortunately my wife isn't!
Don't worry
Tom won't let me do that
Are you going to Japan?
I don't like to brag
It won't be a hard thing to do
What weather!
Would you please show your ID?
A kiss to you!
Oh damn… I just got older
There's a fee for admission
Have we got any mustard?
I thought I'd do that, too

Such confusion!
We're short three cups
I've enjoyed being around Tom
Bad boy!
Bad girl!
Bad dog!
Do you doubt I can do that?
Does this bus go to Boston?
Last year's chewing gum.
Last year's gum.
I assume you've been to Boston
I was afraid you'd failed

It seems like it's backwards

I know I'm a bit lazy
I know that I'm a bit lazy
However, the work is finished
I've eaten it
I'm a bark eater
I'm giving him my phone number
I'm giving her my phone number
She replied, "What about me?
Mother, I am going to Shiprock
Actually, I am not Tom.
Whatever.
It will last forever!
Why aren't you writing?
Layla's husband is in Egypt
I'm a boy
My name's Chucky
My name's Anabelle
I love you, Mary.
But I don't love you.

Why was she crying?
Did you find Amahl or not yet?
Today I'm going home

I don’t think I'll succeed
How did you dare!
You've written the report
We can't do anything on time
They can't shout
She's pretty, but dangerous
Who sent you there?
Set sail!
It's you who must thank me
What crossed your mind?
I'm not an enemy to myself
I'm afraid she has parotitis
It's already 10 p.m
Was the hypothesis confirmed?
I don't like chicken very much
He's Italian
Will you pick me up today?
That's not being advertised
Tom isn't a ballplayer
When will vacation begin?
At what time do you come home?
They don't want to sleep
I've done the same
He's looking at the map
That's a wonder of nature
This guy's dangerous
I'll go then!
You have to stay here!
Out of the way!
Is that not cool?
Come on, say it
Do you mean that seriously?
I can't say more
Oh, look at that
Okay, that's enough for today
I'm sorry that it was so late
Do you like Italian cuisine?
Stop doing that!
Let's hang out again
I've never eaten clam
I'll definitely solve it
I've already forgotten where

I didn't do it very well
Things could've gone better
Are you two speaking French?
Don't waste any more time
Don't talk so fast

We're sowing seeds
She's taking a Berber class
We're in Berber class
What?
Thank you very much.
She's studying Berber
He's showing off

Did you lose your money?
She likes oranges, right?
It's heresy
Roy?
Is that you?

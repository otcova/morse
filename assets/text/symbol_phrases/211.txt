Where's the pharmacy?
I'll be a little late today
Don't let Tom go outside today

She has sail-like ears
Nobody thinks you're stupid.
It's very distracting
I'm a bit nervous right now
What the fuck are you doing?
Tom!
What the fuck are you doing?
Today's Tuesday, right?
Yeah.
Why's it so crowded?
Now I don't know what to do
Where does he live, generally?
Where was the mistake?
I've always loved you, Tom
I've already told Tom
I'm more experienced than Tom
I'd like you to help Tom
We'll protect Tom
First, let's talk about Tom
Don't you miss your father?
Did you know my father?
Do you know my father?
That's very kind, thank you
That's a very beautiful dress
I've been dying to meet him
We're being attacked
Do you know how to fix this?
Do I really need this?
He didn't break my heart
Actually, I should know it
Wait a minute, let me remember
Exactly!
I'm pining for him
I don't eat poultry
He's her beau now
You're going to be okay
It'll be okay
Drop dead!

What else can I add?

I wasn't lonely
Putin is a dickhead!
No, I'm not angry with you
Let me take a break, please
I'm not good at making jokes
I'm working with a Spaniard
I don't appreciate your humor
I don't appreciate Tom's humor
He can't be all bad
She can't be all bad
She's just my friend
He's just my friend
You'll never be an actress
I'm not even sure I like him
I'm not even sure I like her
Do you like solving puzzles?
You are so jealous, right?

My name's Andrew, not Jesus.
Can I have a private opinion?
Where did you get your money?
Where did you get this money?
I don't need a lot of money
How much money do you make?
How much money does Tom make?
Money can't buy friends

How are we doing for time?
I don't know!
Roger that..
It looks okay, it looks okay

Oh dear!

She's a real expert
He's a real expert
Mary's a real expert
Get the hell out of my room!
Could I have some water?

She's very knowledgeable
I'm worried about the baby

You pay attention to me?
Do you want a single room?
It's very simple to understand
My grandma is 75 years old
Did he really tell you that?
Do you want to repeat that?
Where to afterwards?
We're losing a lot of time
No, I do not watch CNN
My uncle's wife is my aunt
The truth.
That's a bad idea.
They aren't dating, are they?
Really?
They aren't dating... yet
At least, I don't think so
What?
What are you talking about?
We're just friends
Seriously!
Mary told Tom we were dating?
Yes.
I'm going to kill her!
It's nobody's fault, but mine
I don't like the sound of this
Mary's song became a hit
There's a hair in my soup.
It looks like your hair.
Tom is part of the team too!
Are dragons real?
I don't want to piss him off
I don't want to piss her off
We just can't stand each other
Where did you go with Tom?
Where did you and Tom go?

You don't have to be scared
Don't leave the papers!
Who is absent today?
How did you accomplish this?
Let's go!
It'll be something to remember
What's the meaning of meaning?
Do you need the key?
What's the point of the point?
Where are Piglet and I going?
It's all a big secret!
In life there is no meaning..
That's a big mistake
What's making you uneasy?
He's always the scapegoat

I've no idea where to start
Tom isn't too smart
Tom insists he's innocent

You've got to work together
It's okay if you want to

Don't teach me how to live!
I'm no longer groggy
People have become so rotten!
I've been seeing someone
Do you mind if I tag along?
Tears filled Mary's eyes
We're out of luck again
Tom brought Mary's mother away
Come on let's catch that guy
I'll show you a good time
Hello, my name is Pekka
What is your name?
You know her name, don't you?
Thanks to you, Tom

Take a look around you!
So why are you doing this?
How about you buy me a drink?
Can you play an instrument?

Argh!
I'm leaving your stinky body!
W-why?
Are things OK with you?

Did you just meet them?
Did you just meet him?
God beware me!
Don't waste your breathe
What did I say, man?
Is your friend a stinker?
For me, it is important
I'm not the trendy type
He and I are like-minded
I'm a runner
You met my sister, didn't you?
I can't believe all this
What's it all about then?
He doesn't have the courage
I didn't hand out anything
I didn't spend anything
Tom knew Maria didn't love him
He didn't even look at my face
Tom knew Mary didn't love him
Daddy, why is the sky blue?
Well, it just is.

Huh?
Where'd I put the keys?
What?
Aren't you hot?

I'm going shopping
Do you want to come?
Sure!
Take your time, but hurry up
That's right
That's strange.
That's a depressing story

Today is a big day, son!
Shoot for the legs!
Don't forget to write the date

What should I write here?
Tom isn't a good writer
Who taught you to write?
I'm a terrible writer
I don't like writing
Do you like writing?
Who is knocking on the door?
Who is knocking?
Get your ass over here!
Get your butt over here!

I'm currently at home
Where is the fitting room?
Could you pass me the remote?
Do you have Facebook?

Do you like costumes?
I love costumes!
Do you like costumes?

Care to join me, handsome?
She's very individualistic
I hate Sunday!
It's a horrible day!
Are you texting Mary?
I'm so grateful for you
I'm just so grateful for you
Will you give me some time?
I couldn't stop crying
I'm not really your friend
Now isn't a very good time
Tom wasn't supportive
How's married life?
It's very bright
It's really bright
Are you OK?
Are you all right?
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
I'm not pretty
Don't worry, I can take it
It's to your left
That isn't allowed
That's the end of that
Is this how it ends?
It's a slip of the pen
Cool!
I'm too tired of arguing
I'm tired of arguing
I'm not going to do that!
Swallow your pride!
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Could you explain it to me?

And just who might you be?
He really doesn't like to fly
Can we talk outside a little?
This is very easy!

Did you have fun in Boston?
Is Mary a real blonde?
You'll never walk alone

I can't hear you.
Okay, what is it?
I am Geronimo Stilton.
What do you want?
So you have no sword?
I am not a knight.
I am NOT a knight!
I am not a knight!
Then go away.
But... okay.
Let's drink something
Where was she going?
I'll phone her tonight

I've some minutes left
There's no reason to panic
No, don't do that
It's all fake
How many people were there?
How often do you go to Boston?
Are you open on Sunday?
Does that make you angry?
I love you, but not that way
What's that, little cat?
She'll return very soon
You're dead
Can you read phonetic symbols?
This isn't the whole story
Don't touch it
That's mine
I wish you'd tell me a story
That'd be some fun at least
Then why are you still alive?
Get up already, you lazybones!
Ah, so that's it!
Did Tom find her?
Did Tom find them?
Did Tom find him?
I'm going to go take a nap
Let's eat the ice cream now
It's going to melt
Look at what's become of me!
I'm ready, man
Bring it!
Would you like to go with me?
That'd be fun
Will you think about it?
Yes, I will.
What makes you smile?
Can you juggle?
Did he accomplish his goals?
I just...
Styopa, I didn't mean you!
Are you with Tom?
There's a party tonight
Are you still jealous?
Mine's bigger than yours
That's a very rude question
I really hope you're kidding
Why do you need so many shoes?
Where did you buy that?
Where did you buy that?

Oh, dad.
Are you not going to eat?
Welcome, then, to Tatoeba!

So... what's this one, then?
Okay, go ahead.
Urk!
Ugh, it's got an aftertaste
Eh?
Uh oh!
Blaaargh!
Well..
Ugh..
Anything happen?
What?
Wait..
What?!
Happy belated!
So, I..
I'm not used to the wings..
Maybe now it's worse
I am NOT dressing as a banana.
Seriously?
It doesn't get better
How do you have your coffee?
White with two, thanks.
If this happens again, call me
It means "How's your wife?
Wasn't Tom in Boston with you?
How much did you pay for this?
About 20 euros.
Wow!
That's incredibly cheap.
Oh, Tom!
Did you do that by yourself?
Is the work hard?
I hear that he's very rich
They say that he's very rich
It's a weird question
That's a weird question
He's rather busy just now
No, I didn't really mean that
I'd like to improve my Spanish
I'd like to improve my Cebuano
Where is my Mezuzah?
He's a cold person like that

It's beyond any doubt
This could take awhile!
Now he'll be out of our hair!
We're made for each other

I'm sick as a dog!
This isn't your cup of tea
I think I'm seeing my future
It's pristine
Drop in, fella

You sure you wanna do this?
Is everybody getting married?
You've done this before?
I can't resist this woman
How can we meet new people?
I'll fix it by myself
I'm in front of the bakery
Could you check the tires?
That'd be great
Don't eat before going to bed
I don't need to sleep a lot
That's very surprising
Do you like to watch movies?
What do you think of your job?
23, 1976
Don't give up
I'm not contradicting you
You're contradicting yourself
I'm not contradicting them
I'm not lighting their candles
Hey, the water is cold
I just hope I don't get sick
Wow, the water is cold
I've gained three kilos
I've gained three kilograms
Please don't make me do that
Smoking isn't allowed here
Let's have a good time
Let's do someone a favor
A Mr. Itoh wants to see you
It's enough, don't cry!
He didn't understand anything
Does she like my hat?
Try this!
All the best!
Hey, mister!
Eat my cat, please!
There we go!

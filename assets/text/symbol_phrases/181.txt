You've known me thirty years
You're talkative, aren't you?
You're miserable, aren't you?
You're lying now, aren't you?
You're looking a little pale
You're impatient, aren't you?
You're efficient, aren't you?
You're ambitious, aren't you?
You think I'm mad, don't you?
You said I wouldn't enjoy it
You got stood up, didn't you?
You don't have to be nervous
You don't have any more time
You don't have a lot of time
You don't have a gun, do you?
You don't get to decide that
You don't even know who I am
You don't even know his name
You don't believe it, do you?
You do like music, don't you?
You do believe me, don't you?
You didn't even know me then
You couldn't wait, could you?
You couldn't have known that
You can't make it without me
You can't be certain of that
Are you trying to make me mad?
Are you sure you're not angry?
You've left me no other choice
I'm fine, thanks for asking!
Isn't life wonderful?
This car doesn't belong to me
What is your nickname?
She's smart
I'm straight
Are you straight or gay?
I'm straight.
That's very hot
Don't touch it
That's real gold
That's our fault
Who decided that?
I'll marry you
I'll raise you
What's with you?
I'm going to win
I blame you, too
I can do it, too
I like you, too
That's good, too
I've missed Tom
How do I do that?
Why was that?
I'm the surgeon
It's cold now
It's all mine
You're all mine
Here's the milk
Now it's here
Now it's gone
Who's it for?
I'm your deputy
It's so clean
I'm your captain
I'm your assistant
He's a pacifist
Does that surprise you?
Does that frighten you?
That's why I love you
I'll bring it to you
You're almost never wrong
I've never been wrong
Here's how it works
I'm not a vegetarian
How does that help us?
Where's the truck?
I've got kids, too
I'm going to stop Tom
We're great together
I've dreamed about this
I've dreamed of this
Why would I do this?
Is that a bad thing?
It's all right there
I couldn't stop them
Why do you need them?
I'm trying to do that
No one's denying that
I'm sorry for that
I'm still not sure
What's your name, son?
They're both smiling
Where's your shirt?
It's really serious
It's quite serious
I've got a lot to say
That's all we saw
I've heard the rumor
I'm doing all right
I feel like I'm ready
We're more than ready
I'm not a politician
It's a very good plan
I'm an orthodontist
That's my final offer
Where's the money now?
I'm not quitting now
I'm doing this now
I've worked all night
That's what scared me
What did you bring me?
You're just like me
I'm no longer married
I'm a lucky man
You're very lucky
You're going to lose
You'd better listen
What did it look like?
Now it's too late
Now we'll never know
I've got the car keys
It's up to us to find it
We're going to fix it
Did you ever find it?
It's up to us to do it
I'm still doing it
Whose fault was it?
Who destroyed it?
How does that help?
I'm going to help
How are your grades?
Why is that good?
Then where did you go?
There's a footprint
It's partly your fault
It's partly my fault
We'd better be fast
How's everything else?
It's still very early
That's how it's done
That's what I'm doing
There's the doctor
Then what did you do?
What else could I do?
People say I'm crazy
Tom thinks I'm crazy
I'm still not certain
Why do you even care?
Why are you in bed?
Why would that be?
How do I get back?
I'm very, very angry
I'm tired already
Does she have a big nose?
He's as stupid as stubborn
She's richer than pretty
Do you like this painting?
Where did you buy it?
Let's drink this beer
Is the festival free?
I've got bad news for you
What can I get for you?
I'll see you next week
Who's going to stop us?
What's that over there?
Do you want me to do that?
How do you figure that?
Why would they do that?
That's the whole point
Where is everybody now?
What changed your mind?
What did they bring me?
I know you won't do it
You're running a fever
Do you know how I feel?
That's no exaggeration
That's just not enough
What's the destination?
I don't need a heart anymore
Tom's remark was insensitive
Does Tom believe in God?
We'd do anything to help you
I'm glad Tom invited you
That's why I lied to you
We'd do anything for you
I'm scared of you
It's about to get worse
You're not doing so well
They're heading this way
I've found a better way
What color is your truck?
We'll deal with it tomorrow
What if we don't find Tom?
It's our job to help Tom
We'll always be together
When did you decide this?
Why do I need to do this?
Is that such a bad thing?
We're not supposed to do that
Do you think Tom can do that?
Who would ever believe that?
Are you willing to do that?
Do you think I can do that?
How do you plan to do that?
How am I going to do that?
I'm real sorry about that
There's a reason for that
What would I do with that?
What's so wrong with that?
How will you manage that?
How long will that take?
You'd better do it soon
What color were Tom's socks?
How long was your shift?
What exactly did you see?
That's all I'm going to say
I'll try to do the same
I got straight A's
They're absolutely right
You'd better do it quickly
How did you figure it out?
What have you found out?
It's a great opportunity
How did you pull that off?
I'm prepared to do that now
I'm quite satisfied now
Why did you ask to see me?
That's the choice we made
I'm a very good listener
How long will that last?
That's about all I know
That's the way we like it
I'm sure it was worth it
I'm not easily impressed
We're heading home
I'm not sure why I'm here
Can you turn up the heat?
Where are you folks from?
What do you want me for?
It's not all your fault
You'd better do it fast
What do I get in exchange?
Would you call a doctor?
What did Tom ask you to do?
When was this decided?
It's not open to debate
What crime did you commit?
It's not going to be cheap
I'm not going to change
What color is your car?
Are you a natural blonde?
It's only just the beginning
That's just the beginning
Could I get my ring back?
I'd like an honest answer
Let's start over again
Tom's father's a bit of a soak
On a clear day, we can see Mt
I don't have time to help her
What is Ido?
How much is this book?
This book costs 20 dollars
Is this tofu?
Who taught you to speak?
Excuse me, what are you doing?
Did you ski yesterday?
Merry Spring Festival!
I am rich, fat and happy
I drink tea, too
I am not rich, fat or happy
You also teach her English?
What do you think about this?
Do you know how to speak?
Has your friend divorced?
Have you got a little sister?
Have you drank tea?
I'm faster
Are you a reporter?
How did you learn to speak?
Are you not a teacher?
Did you drink tea?
Do you drink tea?
When do you go to class?
Does he go to school?
Are you watching TV today?
When can you come to my home?
When did the movie start?
Are they brutal enough?
I'm exaggerating
How long does it last?
That's not allowed!
How about getting some coffee?
You're going to get better
There's nobody at the door
Do you know why that happens?
What effect will that have?
How long have you owned it?
I'm beginning to regret it
We're both a lot older now
What do you want in return?
I've got some work to do
I've got some studying to do
That's why we have to stay
How do you feel about that?
What else did you do there?
Are you sure about all this?
It's a nice day for a walk
I think it's going to work
How exactly can I help you?
I'll never doubt you again
That's what I intend to do
That's what I'm going to do
That's what we'd like to do
What do you expect me to do?
You're as charming as ever
I promise I won't forget
How do you plan to do it?
That's not very far, is it?
How are you dealing with it?
How do you plan on doing it?
I don't know how to stop it
I promise I won't forget it
I said don't worry about it
I'm going to help you do it
That's how we dealt with it
That's not very fair, is it?
That's not very good, is it?
That's not very nice, is it?
I'd like you to do the same
What was I supposed to say?
We're back where we started
How long's it going to take?
Whose fault is that?
I've learned to accept that
Why exactly would I do that?
I'll have to meet you there
Who's responsible for these?
Who's responsible for this?
It's going to stay that way
I've always dated older women
I'd love to go out with you
How did that work out for you?
I saw Marcus's house
I don't find that amusing
What was Tom doing in there?
Tell Tom I'll be back
I'm used to this kind of work
Dang!
I've lost my job!
Make way, dude
I'm coming through
Did you go to Tokyo Tower?
What do you want to do?
Go home?
I don't have any male siblings
Thank you, I'm just looking
Tom doesn't want to help you
What are their rights?
Oh my God!
My son, do you believe in God?
Yes, my father.
This man is a spy; he must die
Mercy!
Mercy!
Mercy!
What do you want from me?
What have I done to you?
Scoundrel!
I cried, what are you doing?
Courage, my friends!
I beg you pardon, milord
It's not Hebrew, but Latin
Oh!
Poor girl!
Shut up, servant of hell!
What is thunder?
It's Satan's laughter
Don't scream, or you're dead
Heaven be praised!
Oh God, help me!
I'm not that kind of sentence!
Tom is stalking me!
Help!
Germany won the World Cup!
Yeah, Tom, I know
This one's cuter
Tom's cuter anyway
That's so not cool
You're on the same team
We're on the same team
But you stole them from me!
Oh, hi mom
No, I was just passing by.
What do his parents do?
I have no idea.
That's rude
This is crazy!
We could get caught!
Whaat?
I don't like your band's name
I think that it's stupid
I'm in trouble because of you
Did you have fun at the game?
Who won?
What if my mom says no?
What if Tom says no?
I can do it too!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Tom, call security right now!
Do you want to walk together?
Oh my God, Mary has done it!
Oh my God, Tom has done it!
Where is Tom's house?
Hello girls.
Do you want a soda?
Tom is an average-looking guy
I'm going first!
That wasn't even a lie
Did you touch the bottom?
What if someone sees this?
What if someone sees it?
What if someone sees us?
You haven't met my mom yet
You're just like an angel
He's dumb and immature
Can't we just be friends?
Why can't we just be friends?
How dare you do that to Tom?
How dare you do that to me?
Hey, you two!
What are you doing?
That's very observant of you
Sorry, but Tom's right
Sorry, but Mary's right
I'm not easily offended
It would be awesome!
I can't afford it right now
I won't be able to pay for it
Have you tried that before?
Have you tried this before?
I don't know them at all
What does Phoebus mean?
If you are happy, I am happy
Do you have stomach pain?
Do I have to do that?
How could God do that to us?
I'm on the pill
Are you deaf or what?
What's the next math problem?
Will that be hard for you?
Were you unlucky?
Were you unhappy?
Let's play ball
I'm bushed
Did you call 911?
What a stupid guy!
Whoa!
Oh, sorry
Did you ask Tom why?
Did you hear Tom is in town?
You don't really know me, Tom
You don't seem to get it, Tom
You know everything I do, Tom
You shouldn't have killed Tom
Who's going to stop Tom?
How did you answer Tom?
You're better than Tom
Did you ever meet Tom?
Let's go and get Tom
How do you know Tom is there?
How often does Tom do that?
Are you sure this is Tom's?
Maybe we can stop at Tom's
Were you a friend of Tom's?
Which way is Tom's room?
Let's hope Tom is all right
What was Tom's last name?
It has Tom's name on it
What's Tom still doing here?
How soon will Tom get here?
I've never seen Tom wear a hat
We'll never let Tom go
What's Tom's favorite food?
Don't set off the alarm
I can't remember who said what
You haven't even tried
Have I changed that much?
Did we wake you up?
Can you handle it, Tom?
Hamisi doesn't want sugar
Hamisi doesn't use sugar
Hamisi doesn't use milk
My friend doesn't use milk
My friend doesn't use sugar
My friend doesn't want sugar
There's not enough food
Who does he look like now?
He makes everything worth it!
What rhymes with Tatoeba?
Alright, that's enough
It's not that big of a deal
You know what I mean.
Actually, Tom, I don't.
Does Tom have a girlfriend?
What were you two doing there?
That's not true
No, you don't!
Why did you do that to him?
Why did you do that to her?
She loved you!
I'm probably just paranoid
Is this an invitation?
Is this a date?
Is this a date, or what?
Was that an insult?
Was that a squirrel?
Do I look like I care?
Do I look like I care?
Are you serious?
I'm absolutely serious.
I haven't got a chance
I haven't got a chance.
Yes, you have!
I won't get mad
I promise I won't get mad
I wouldn't go that far
I was just day-dreaming
I wasn't that smart in school
It's yours if you want it
And why not?
What about that?
No, that's too expensive.
Do you want to play?
I don't know how.
It's not like I'm not trying
She's a living encyclopaedia
It's a work of art
It's still cloudy
It's our only hope
I'm hungry now
It's a risky plan
Did you draw that?
Were you truthful?
Did you wash that?
A man's home is his castle
A woman's place is in the home
A woman's work is never done
Do as I say, and not as I do
First think, and then speak
Garbage in, garbage out
You win some, you lose some
One day, I will marry her
That's a good story
You don't have to do anything
You'll get what you deserve
You're in way over your head
It's my only hope
We don't have any money left
You don't have to be here now
You don't have to go in there
Are we going to attack them?
You don't have to say anything
You don't have to say any more
You don't have to make excuses
You don't even know what it is
I'm learning Burmese
What is the best road to go?
Don't be afraid
He won't bite you
Help!" he shouted
He's disgusting
C-section next Monday
Come with me, come with us!
Go with them!
You can't come with us
You're on thin ice, mister
You'd better watch it, buddy
We're back online now
You've done well for yourself
You were afraid, weren't you?
You're dying, aren't you?
You're too young to retire
You haven't changed much
You've done a magnificent job
You've done a terrific job
You're going to have to do it
You've got a vivid imagination
You shouldn't have kissed her
You're doing really great
You've done a lot of good
You've done very well so far
You're going to be famous
You've got to face facts
You shouldn't be driving
You're my favorite babysitter
Why are you so mad at me?
Don't be so rough on yourself
Here, let me do that for you
I'm glad you could join us
It's too late to try that
It's too late for that
I know things you don't
Have you met my sister?
What else do you see?
Do you have a criminal record?
Have you made any progress?
How do you plan to proceed?
I don't think I need one
Are you trying to insult me?
Are you trying to trick me?
Did you just call me?
Are you ready to leave?
I think it's too late
What do you call it?
That's a really good idea
It's time to come home
When exactly did you get here?
What choice do I have?
Well, I'd better be going
Do you like to gamble?
What else do you plan to do?
Are you going back to Boston?
I'd like you to do your best
Would you like a banana?
Who are you angry at?
Where do you think you are?
I think I've found the answer
Can you read what that says?
Can I see a copy of the rules?
Why did you agree to do it?
Can I see it before I go?
Listen, I have to go
I'm not a gambler
It's your own fault
Come on, let's take shelter
Can I touch you?
You are coming home right now!
Yes, one day, I would like to
I love you, do you hear me?
I love you!
What is a computer?
What is a calculator?
What is a fax?
Do you have your pills?
Oh no, I forgot my pills!
That amplifier doesn't work
Many men want to be thin, too
He's so handsome!
He's so handsome
She's a total bitch
Tom is soft-spoken and polite
I brought you a gift.
Did you forget your money?
Are you always that busy?
Have you met him?
No, but I've met his wife.
No, not really
Why?
Did you have any trouble?
Did you know it was raining?
Did you see any pigeons?
Did you find who did it?
Did you look under the car?
What was your first tattoo?
Your name is Tom, correct?
You don't have to go with Tom
You're more polite than Tom
You're no better than Tom
You're dating Tom, aren't you?
Tom won't try to stop you
Let's watch the game
Let's wait on the porch
Let's try to stay focused
Let's try to have a good time
Let's try to contact Tom again
Let's try to be rational
Let's try and stay focused
Let's try and get in
Let's try and be positive
Let's talk about that later
Let's take turns driving
Let's take Tom with us
Let's stop playing games
Let's stop doing this
Let's start with you
Let's start a band
Let's slow down
Let's see you beat that
Let's see what's out there
Let's see what's on TV
Let's see what Tom wrote
Let's see what Tom wants
Let's see what I can get
Let's see if Tom is here
Let's see how well Tom does
Let's say that you're right
Let's run for it
Let's risk it
Let's play some blues
Let's paint the ceiling first
Let's open a bottle of wine
Let's not talk about money now
Let's not start that again
Let's not invite Tom
Let's not forget that
Let's not do anything stupid
Let's not bother Tom
Let's not bother Tom with this
Let's move it, people
Let's make the most of it
Let's look at the facts
Let's light some candles
Let's just let Tom handle it
Let's just forget it
Let's just do it now
Let's hope Tom does it for me
Let's help each other out
Let's head back home
Let's have another beer
Let's go to the hospital now
Let's go to my place
Let's go see what Tom knows
Let's go make fun of Tom
Let's go have a pint or two
Let's go have a chat with Tom
Let's go away this weekend
Let's go and surprise Tom
Let's get Tom's opinion first
Let's get this party started
Let's get out while we can
Let's get away from here
Let's get a move on
Let's get a little closer
Let's forget it for now
Let's follow the others
Let's find the others
Let's drink to that
Let's do better than that
Let's discuss it now
Let's clean the house
Let's celebrate with ice cream
Let's build a fire
Let's all settle down
Let's all settle down here
Let's all get back to work
I'm worried about your health
I'm calm now
There's no fire
Why would I mind?
Why would I care?
Why should I lie?
What do I do now?
What can I bring?
What a neat idea!
Were you tactful?
Were you sincere?
Were you serious?
Were you nervous?
Were you naughty?
Were you jealous?
Were you careful?
Should I do that?
Should I ask Tom?
How do I do this?
Have you read it?
Do you read lips?
Do I look normal?
Do I look insane?
Do I get a prize?
Did you pass out?
Would you help me?
Where do I go now?
What would I wear?
Was that too much?
Was that too easy?
Then what do I do?
Should I call Tom?
Is your wife home?
Is this real gold?
Is there any food?
Is the party over?
Is the coffee hot?
How do we stop it?
How do I know you?
How do I fix that?
How do I find you?
Do I need a nurse?
Did you sign this?
Did you read this?
Did you read that?
Did you move this?
Did you feel that?
Did Tom win again?
Did they hurt you?
Did I do all that?
Could you shut up?
Could you read it?
Are you two ready?
Are you ready yet?
Are you ready now?
Am I on that list?
How can you fix it?
Did you feed the dog?
That's a very good plan
Do you want a ride home?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Are you having a bad day?
Why do we need to do that?
Are you having a hard day?
Do you still play the piano?
What kind of pet do you want?
What kind of job do you want?
There's no snow on the ground
What kind of car do you drive?
Does it please you?
Is that really you?
What came over you?
Does it upset you?
How drunk are you?
Are they ready yet?
Isn't Tom home yet?
Is the sun up yet?
Does that mean yes?
Are you ever wrong?
Did I say it wrong?
Do I look worried?
Does it still work?
Where do I sign up?
Why not live it up?
Is the sun up?
I'm still mad at Tom
How do we find Tom?
How do we stop Tom?
What became of Tom?
When can I see Tom?
How do I help Tom?
How do I stop Tom?
Is this a bad time?
It's not yet time
Did you order this?
Have you read this?
Should I take this?
Do I deserve this?
Who put that there?
Did I just do that?
Did you write that?
It isn't like that
When did I do that?
What a great story!
It's a good story
It wasn't a pretty sight
That's not much of a plan
How do we find out?
Is the window open?
Were you obedient?
Could we leave now?
Could we order now?
I'm better now
What am I missing?
Why should we mind?
Why do you need me?
Would you hire me?
I'm still mad
Is there any left?
Am I free to leave?
Why should I leave?
Are you good at it?
Where did I put it?
Did you borrow it?
Would you risk it?
Does it still hurt?
Does your arm hurt?
Do you belong here?
How did I get here?
Would you like a little help?
Do you need a little help?
Does Tom need help?
How long do I have?
Were they any good?
This isn't any fun
What am I here for?
Is there a lot left to do?
What did I just do?
What else can I do?
How can I compete?
Do you want coffee?
Do you need a coat?
Is the coast clear?
Is the place clean?
What could that be?
What could this be?
Homeopathy doesn't work
There are 7 main chakras
Something's wrong with the car
I'm not sure what's wrong
I identified Tom's car
You and I don't see eye-to-eye
You don't even have to explain
Did you ask the others?
Don't be sad because it's over
Get a hold of yourself, Tom
It was nice to meet you, Tom
I'll get back to you, Tom
Do you mind if I call you Tom?
What's your plan with Tom?
What's your deal with Tom?
What's the deal with Tom?
What'll you do with Tom?
What was wrong with Tom?
Were you in love with Tom?
So how did it go with Tom?
Please don't leave me with Tom
Is it OK if I go out with Tom?
I'm going to hang out with Tom
How was your date with Tom?
How is it going with Tom?
Did you want to meet with Tom?
Did you have fun with Tom?
Did you get in touch with Tom?
Did you break up with Tom?
Could I have a word with Tom?
Did you say your name was Tom?
Are you sure that it was Tom?
Are you sure his name was Tom?
It's too late to visit Tom
Don't you want to visit Tom?
Why do you listen to Tom?
What's your connection to Tom?
What'll they do to Tom?
What should I say to Tom?
What have I ever done to Tom?
What am I going to say to Tom?
Were you married to Tom?
That's what I said to Tom
It's hard to say no to Tom
How could you do this to Tom?
How close are you to Tom?
Have you said anything to Tom?
Don't you want to talk to Tom?
Are you sure about this, Tom?
I'll be right there, Tom
Did you remember to thank Tom?
Where are they taking Tom?
When exactly did you see Tom?
When did you see Tom?
Don't you want to see Tom?
Do we know for sure it's Tom?
We don't want to overwhelm Tom

I'm blaming him
I'm fond of him
I'm nice to him
I'm sick of him
We've hired him
We've upset him

Move!
Get informed!
Be proud!
Interesting assertions!
Stop this instant!
Lord have mercy!
May God have mercy!
God have mercy!
Get rid of him!
Here, take this!
Here!
I've been vindicated
It's truly very cold
It's truly quite cold
It's really quite cold
He's making a big mistake
Well get going!
Be polite!
Then join in!
So join in!
So take part!
So participate!
Then participate!
She's crying
They're having a conversation
Wait patiently!
Well, okay!
Well, look!
Stop your chit-chat!
She's working
He'll soon catch up with her
She's much younger than him
She's shorter than him
She loves him, not me
She's as busy as him
She's his sister
He's older than her
I'm as tall as him
She's at the door
I like him because he's honest
You're her friend, aren't you?
He is a math-geek
It's larger than that
He isn't in the apartment
He's returned to Japan
Is this Mary?
Do you live in Athens?
Neo-Nazis are hatemongers
You didn't say you had a wife
It's a gray horse
Do you like to do this?
When did he die?
When did she die?
You're a big family
That's a very small tree
That's a very pretty tree
Did you buy it here?
But is it fair?
We didn't make this decision
How deep is this pit?
He's all man
He's a proper man
Who's playing?
An old, lonely man lives there
How far has the virus spread?
We fucked up!
Are they telling the truth?
I'm not able to buy a house
He's always mansplaining
Do you speak Kurmanji?
I'm not frum
I'm not an observant Jew
How do you get along with Tom?
Did she say anything about me?
Did he say anything about me?
Who did you get it from?
Dad and mom won't come
Do you have a map of the city?
I don't like your friend
If you leave, I'll kill myself
Well?
Nu?
I'm sick of hearing that
Blood rushed to Tom's cheeks
Blood rushed to Mary's cheeks
Tom changed the Wi-Fi password
Let's tip a few tonight
To each their own!
What's that funny smell?
Where's your uni?
I don't wonder", said Tom
Is that the sea or a lake?
How do I create an account?
How do I log into my account?
I can't log into my account
How do I change my password?
How do I reset my password?
How can I fix my login issues?
Are bats mammals?
I'm being exploited
Are butterflies insects?
Is a whale a mammal?
He's got a moustache
Where's your belly button?
He's the nicest teacher ever
He's our Berber teacher
The class didn't shut up
He doesn't have erasers
Is this teacher human?
I'm gonna deal with you
I know you're a bitch
Her boobs weren't on her chest
He can't respond in Berber
I don't remember the day
The teacher didn't talk to me
It's ridiculously bad
It didn't go very good
He didn't have plenty of time
It's an open wound
He doesn't use this anymore
He's a piercer
There's no one at the entrance
I'm not hurting you
Such a marmalade!
What do you want, cat?
Here's a problem!
Hey, kitty!
He's husband material
He's marriage material
They're not fat
They aren't fat
They're from Algiers
It's January already
He doesn't like this phone
It's a mosquito bite
Tom isn't composing
Praise me!
Who does she work with?
Does she work here?
Does your daughter work?
Tom doesn't write
Tom didn't write
Does he have a scooter?
Has he got a scooter?
He doesn't have a belly button
Can I see your belly button?
No, you can't.
Can I see your belly button?
Where in Austria do you live?
You shouldn't joke about that
Thanks, I hate it
Occupied!
What's the rush?
‚ÄúWe're leaving
But all the others ‚Äî yes.‚Äù
I've had a rethink
Drink the milk!
They're creative
I won't eat what Tom cooked
It's what's inside that counts
Would you do it again?
I can't make my mind up
Tom couldn't make his mind up
Mary couldn't make her mind up
There's a lot of snow
We're out!
That's a pen
That's a pen, not a pencil
That's a pencil, not a pen
Tom sang "Auld Lang Syne.
What language do they speak?
He was born on May 5, 1998
He isn't being careful
It's greater than 10
That's not a pencil
It's a pen
No, I don't agree
What have you chosen?
What have you picked?
What did you choose?
What did you pick?
She can't have done it
He's a friend of his
It'll end badly
That'll end badly
Do you really not know him?
Don't you actually know him?
Thirty pages?
He had a lie-down after dinner
That's all changed
It's a game changer
Has that all changed?
She's asleep with a cold
It's changed my life
It's changed so much
That's got to change
That'll have to change
That's going to change
The rules don't change
They don't want change
They won't ever change
All that's changing now
It's changed since then
That law hasn't changed
My plans haven't changed
The rules haven't changed
It's you who's changed, not me
I knew you liked her!
I knew you liked him!
She knew you loved her.
I know.
I knew you'd like her
I knew you'd like him
I can't believe he's gone
I can't believe she's gone
I'm not speaking English
Tomorrow I'll travel to Paris
I'm four weeks pregnant
I wasn't hurt badly
I wasn't badly hurt
I'm not going out now
I'm not sure I can win
I didn't read that book
Why call Tom now?
I wasn't home yesterday
I'm not as old as I look
What an interesting adventure!
I'm going to trim my beard
I'm going to shave my head
What does Tom do there?
When does your class start?
Do you think Tom loves me?
I'm not a good writer
I'm not a very good writer
It's cool out here
It's warm out here
I'm not sure what I'll do
That's mostly true
I'm not where I should be
We've made some new rules
It isn't up to them
It's a lot of money
It's not the policy
I'm not as young as I look
It's not up to them
It's quiet out here
It's so obvious now
It's soft and fuzzy
It's the same today
It's very nice here
I'm not as tired as you are
It's very well done
It's very, very bad
It's what people do
I'm not as young as you are
It's what they want
Let's back up a bit
Our work isn't done
I'm not rich, but I'm happy
That isn't so today
Why are you doing this, Tom?
Tom won't give a gift to Mary
This is a non-issue
I'm not the man I used to be
You're doing something wrong
This isn't a debate
This isn't a museum
This isn't a prison
Time isn't an issue
Well, neither do you
I'm not a doctor
I'm a nurse
Wow!
That's too bad
Yeah, I'd like that
I'm not as fast as I once was
I've bought a ticket
That's an old saying
I'm not sure how much I drank
Very well done, guys
We'll get that fixed
We're open every day
Well, that's too bad
I wasn't supposed to come here
You're a pretty girl
That isn't true today
That isn't why I quit
I'm not picky about what I eat
That's not the reason I quit
That isn't the reason I quit
That's not why I quit
That's not the system
I'm not sure I have to do that
I'm not sure where I should go
That's what people do
That's what they want
Tom won't run away
This isn't very clear
This isn't very sweet
Tom won't trust me
Our work isn't done yet
Tom wore a T-shirt
That's why it's big
That's not the worst part
That isn't the worst part
This apple isn't that juicy
This isn't an issue anymore
He's a brave skydiver
We're waiting for new orders
You're not a parent, are you?
He wonders if it's true
He's facing a challenge
He's filling out a ballot
He's a very gentle person
He's a responsible driver
You won't betray me, will you?
He's hiding under the table
He's away on a business trip
He won $10,000 in the lottery
He's balancing on a tightrope
He's the brains of our company
You won't forget me, will you?
This isn't a theory
It's fact
Tom's desk is over there
I'm not a student
I'm a teacher
You'll need to sign a contract
You're supposed to be here now
Tom was wearing a T-shirt
I'm not a teacher
I'm a student
Tom woke up at six-thirty
Tom left my office at 2:30
Tom stole someone's wallet
Tom was just a kid in 2013
Tom's house has a basement
Would I do it again?
No, I don't think so
Tom isn't a very good hacker
This isn't my floor
Tom hasn't seen that movie yet
Tom is an all-around handyman
Did you expect that to happen?
I'm not a student here
I'm a teacher
I've only got one of these
Doesn't doing that get old?
It's your loss, not mine
Did I miss anything else?
Can't you find your keys?
Adult tickets are $13.00
You're not mad, are you?
Do I look like a dancer?
Are these really Tom's?
Are Tom's claims valid?
I'm grateful for this
Have I made a mistake?
At least, nobody died
I'm not a carpenter
I'm a plumber
At least, I was there
Are you able to do it?
It's twenty to two
Don't blow your cool
Don't bet against it
Do you see a pattern?
Do you remember 2013?
It's a quarter past two
Come on, get serious
Check out what's new
Are your kids stupid?
Are you sitting down?
All right, calm down
All right, I'll come
You've got it right
You're such a loser
It'll be a struggle
Did you buy tickets?
Thanks.
No, thank YOU!
I've only got one
It's half past nine
What time is it?
Ten to.
Ten to what?
Tend to your own business.
I'm hungry.
Hi Hungry; I'm Dad!
He's still in the hospital
He's a very good tennis player
He'll do something about it
He doesn't know how to drive
It's special
Why can't we just get along?
I still am, but I used to, too
You are a sad, sad person
Maybe I'll lose
Here's my report
It's foggy again
It's lonely here
It's sunny again
Maybe we'll lose
That isn't ready
That's not ready
I'm a cat lover
Here's what I got
It's not my money
It's what dogs do
Maybe you'll lose
I'm a tomcat
We aren't doctors
What's wrong here?
She's a Sephardic Jew
Tom's father was a Jew
It's a real threat
It's about control
It's all they have
It's all we've got
It's been terrific
It's blue in color
It's just not true
It's pink, not red
It's very low-tech
Maybe they'll lose
It isn't a priority
It's not a priority
It's more than that
Who'll you eat with?
Don't bump your head
Don't deny the facts
Don't drive too fast
Don't get thrown out
Don't give into fear
Don't kiss in public
Don't listen to them
Don't take any risks
Don't drive that slow
Will your parents be there?
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Who took my pen?
What got resolved?
They're my students
We'd better not go now
Have you learned anything?
I can't believe this worked
I can't believe that worked
Here's a better plan
Here's a work around
Here's an easier way
Tom didn't know Mary drank
Here's how it worked
Here's how it's done
Here's what it means
Hey, it could happen
Hey, welcome to the club
I've read about that
Is it getting bigger?
Is it going to be OK?
Is that case settled?
Is the chimney clean?
Is there another way?
It won't just happen
It almost isn't fair
It didn't look right
It doesn't affect me
It doesn't cost much
It doesn't end there
It doesn't take long
It isn't October yet
It isn't their money
It isn't very common
It surprised me, too
It was an eye-opener
It wasn't even close
It'll be a challenge
It'll be hit or miss
It'll blow your mind
It'll never get done
It'll only get worse
It'll open your eyes
It's a bad situation
It's a big challenge
It's a bit of a joke
Tom said he'd find Mary
It's a bit technical
It's a busy day here
It's a critical fact
It's a crucial stage
It's a delicate time
It's a fun situation
It's a great company
It's a great rivalry
It's a great theater
It's a guessing game
It's a little unfair
It's a longish story
It's a one-shot deal
It's a proven system
It's a rare disorder
It's a sad situation
It's a serious issue
Tom isn't my dad
It's a serious thing
It's a simple choice
Tom said that he'd find Mary
It's a simple system
It's a stable system
It's a stressful job
It's a terrible idea
Mr. Jackson is very strict
It's a terrific idea
I'm glad that Tom left
It's a tough economy
It's a tough process
We'd better not do that now
It's a whole new day
It's Tom I want to see
It's about that time
It's all in good fun
It's all luck anyway
I didn't know Tom drank
It's all over, right?
I didn't know that Tom drank
It's all they've got
How sad is your life?
It's also really fun
It's an amazing plan
He's stealing
It's an easy process
It's an equity issue
It's an immense task
It's an old building
Tom didn't have kids
It's been rough here
Was Tom wearing a helmet?
It's bound to happen
It's cheaper to rent
It's good for morale
That's why Tom isn't here
It's good, clean fun
It's happening a lot
Tom's time is up
It's ideal, isn't it?
These shoes must be Tom's
These shoes are probably Tom's
I think these shoes are Tom's
It's indeed very sad
It's just a business
Tom didn't hit anyone
She'll hear me
He'll definitely hear me
She'll definitely hear me
They'll hear me
They'll definitely hear me
It's just an opinion
It's just really fun
It's just really sad
Tom doesn't earn much
It's kind of amazing
This umbrella must be Tom's
It's kind of surreal
It's less than ideal
It's meant to happen
It's more common now
It's not October yet
It's not a done deal
You won't change Tom's mind
It's not a new issue
It's not about trust
Tom didn't hit anybody
It's not fun anymore

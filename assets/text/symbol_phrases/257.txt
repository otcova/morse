We could leave early, I guess
I know Tom didn't win
We can't do that by ourselves
I knew Tom didn't win
We aren't supposed to do that
This room can't be used today
This isn't interesting at all

It's very expensive, isn't it?
Who did Tom sing for?
It's no use worrying about it
What did Tom just do?
It looks like you're prepared
It looks like you're confused
We can't let Tom win
Is there anything in that box?
Is Boston bigger than Chicago?
If you want to leave, you may
Is Tom likely to win?
If we don't do that, who will?
I'm sure Tom can win
I've sold all of my old books
I'll let Tom do that
I've never tried water skiing
I'd never lie to Tom
I've heard you play the piano
I wouldn't leave Tom

I hope Tom won't win
I'll pour you a glass of wine
Tom said he didn't have a car
I'll paint my room light blue
Tom said he didn't drink wine
I'll do the same thing you do
I'll do that in my spare time
Tom promised he'd wait for us
I'll do that if you ask me to
Tom probably wouldn't do that
I'll be in Boston next Monday
Tom probably won't drink that
Tom probably couldn't do that
I'll arrive in Boston at 2:30
I'd rather not see that movie
I didn't see Tom win
I'd probably enjoy doing that
I didn't let Tom win
I'd never abandon my children
I'd like to keep working here

I'd never leave Tom
I told Tom I'd wait
I think you're too old for me
I think you're pulling my leg
I think that'll be easy to do
Tom is sick, so he can't come
I shouldn't leave early today
I should get home before 2:30
I bet Tom won't win
I really should've left early

I'll be back on October 20th
I'd never go there by myself
I'd like you to do that, too
I'd help if you wanted me to
I'd better leave early today
I'd better do that right now
I'd be a fool not to do that
I wasn't sure how to respond
I wasn't even here yesterday
Tom is hoping you'll do that
I wasn't aware of the danger
I wasn't at school on Monday

I can't believe you said yes
Tom told me he wasn't angry
I can't believe you ate that
Tom told me he wasn't alone
I almost didn't wait for you
I admit I've never done that
How would you have done that?
How much time will that take?
How much time does that take?
How much did that watch cost?
How long ago did that happen?
Have you ever been on a ship?
Don't force me do that again
Does it rain a lot in Boston?
Do you want to sing together?
Tom told me he isn't hungry
Do you use aftershave lotion?
Do you often have to do that?
Tom told me he didn't smoke
Do you know where the dog is?
Tom told me he didn't do it
Do you know how to use an ax?
Tom told me he didn't agree
Do you have any blue scarves?
Do you buy lots of magazines?
Did you remember to buy eggs?
Did you go bowling yesterday?
Couldn't you do that, please?
Can't you do that any faster?
Tom should've waited for us
Can you still ride a bicycle?
Can you still move your legs?
Can you still do that for me?
Can you still do a handstand?
Tom seemed to think so, too
Can you do that more quickly?
Can we do that before Monday?
Are you still in charge here?
Are you still afraid of dogs?
Are you still a teacher here?
Are you still a student here?
Are you going to go swimming?
You're not a coach, are you?
You won't need that anymore
You shouldn't be eating now
You look like you're scared
You look like you're lonely
You look like you're hungry
You look like you're afraid
You know I wouldn't do that
You aren't a pilot, are you?
Would you mind coming early?
Why does that matter anyway?
Who went with you yesterday?
Who else would've done that?
Who else might've done that?
Who else could've done that?
Who do you usually eat with?
Where in Australia were you?
When do you expect to start?
When did you win this award?
What month is your birthday?
What else do you need to do?
What else do you have to do?
What did you see last night?
We're both going to do that
We'll find a way to do that
Tom says that he didn't win
We'll be traveling together
Tom says that he didn't cry
Tom said that he didn't win
Tom said that he didn't cry
We need to get home by 2:30
Tom said it's OK to eat now
Tom said he'll probably win
We don't do that very often
Tom said he'll probably cry
We didn't do that very well
We didn't do that last week
This watch wasn't expensive
Tom probably won't ever win
This is very easy, isn't it?
This box isn't large enough
That's an interesting movie
That book isn't interesting
Tom made us wait until 2:30
Tom looks like he's worried
Tom looks like he's wealthy
Tom looks like he's trapped
Please don't drink too much
Tom looks like he's through
Tom looks like he's shocked
Tom looks like he's serious
May I borrow your lawnmower?
Tom looks like he's puzzled
Let's try and do that again
Tom looks like he's pleased
Let's do that one more time
Tom looks like he's nervous
Let's come here every month
Tom looks like he's jealous
Tom looks like he's healthy
Tom looks like he's furious
It'll soon be time to leave
Tom looks like he's excited
It wouldn't hurt to do that
Tom looks like he's dubious
Tom looks like he's curious
It looks like you're sleepy
Tom looks like he's certain
It looks like you're scared
Tom looks like he's annoyed
It looks like you're hungry
Is your room as big as mine?
If you want to leave, leave
If it's raining, I won't go
I'm still working in Boston
I'm not sure how I can help
I'm not studying French now
Tom knows you can't do that
I'm leaving Boston tomorrow
Tom knew I wouldn't do that
I'm happy we didn't do that
Tom knew I wasn't going to win
I'm going to do that myself
Tom isn't worried about you
I'm fairly fluent in French
Tom isn't working part-time
I'm a native French speaker
Tom isn't wearing a sweater
I'll probably do that again
Tom isn't wearing a red tie
I'll never agree to do that
Tom isn't wearing a new hat
I'll have to do that myself
Tom isn't smiling right now
I'll go and call the doctor
Tom isn't looking for a job
I'll do that in the morning
Tom isn't here this morning
I'll come over this evening
Tom isn't ever going to win
Tom wasn't in love with me
I'll buy a pair of scissors
Tom isn't a baseball player
I'll be turning thirty soon
Tom is well-known in Boston
I'd tell you the same thing
I'd rather not speak French
I'd never have allowed that
I'd never been there before
I'd love to see you do that
I'd like to listen to music
I'd like to borrow a wrench
I'd like to become a tailor
I'd hoped you could do that
I'd have gone if I could've

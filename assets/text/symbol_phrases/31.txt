I've forgotten her surname
Have you got a twin brother?
Ziri wasn't new to this
Ziri heard his nephew's voice
Ziri's gear was there
Things grew quiet... too quiet
Soon after, the hyena left
Ziri didn't survive the night
Ziri couldn't feel his toes
Ziri doesn't run the fastest
Ziri's head hit the tree
The hyena didn't give pursuit
Terrified, Ziri kept running
His wife was pregnant!
Was it written by you?
What do you think, Bożena?
Or maybe the sea?
So, where is she?
Make it ice cream or ice milk.
Happy 10-year anniversary!
Don't start with that again
Can you stop bringing that up?
They don't give a fuck
He doesn't live here
They don't live here
Who's that next to Tom?
Some people just won't listen
Ziri didn't touch the dog
Actually, Ziri has no idea
Ziri won't go alone
Ziri shouldn't look behind him
The voice called Ziri's name
It didn't always make sense
Ziri wasn't human
Ziri was really well-mannered
When Ziri went home, he cried
We didn't build that bridge
Ziri doesn't work as a ranger
Ziri didn't want to get closer
Ziri's eyes were open
Ziri's wife ran away
Ziri's wife went missing
Ziri's wife got abducted
Ziri's eyes were wide open
Sometimes, we need time alone
Ziri asked for Rima's name
Let's just change the subject
It's not my idea
This isn't our train
We thought so too, at first
How many shots were fired?
What a wonderful morning!
I know who you're looking for
Did the cameras pick it up?
Do you know her email address?
She's not alone any more
She's no longer alone
Who's the new guest?
May I ask who this is about?
We've got to take the stairs.
To the fourteenth floor?
Oh, fandabidozi.
We'll have to take the stairs.
To the fourteenth floor?
Nice one.
Greek.
How are you feeling today?
Like death.
I'm sick as a dog
He's wearing good shoes
She's wearing nice shoes
What do you want again?
Women aren't taken seriously
I don't edit your articles
I'll give her my hand
Ziri won't write much
Ziri's head hurts a lot
In the end, Ziri found Rima
Ziri didn't receive any answer
This cave is the devil's home
Ziri can't do otherwise
When Ziri looked up, he froze
Ziri likes reading Rima's blog
Ziri knew everything.
Ziri didn't hear Rima go away
Ziri's talkie-walkie was gone
Why did Ziri warn Rima?
Internet wasn't working
Ziri's ears were bleeding
Ziri doesn't like that idea
Ziri wasn't talkative at all
Ziri sat there, confused
Ziri can read Rima's mind
Ziri didn't have eyes
After all, silence is gold
Ziri's heart started racing
Ziri just can't risk it
Ziri didn't even cry
Ziri didn't even really notice
Ziri doesn't blame himself
He didn't know, after all
Ziri did't even seem surprised
Ziri?
It's not even a real name
Ziri was still there, smoking
You are Greeks, I heard you
I'm done with waiting
What!?
Is that a joke?
Mr. President!?
Have you kissed them?
They've ousted the president!
Will you tuck me in?
Will you invite me?
I want to take a bath!
Can this gas be liquefied?
What happens if I refuse?
I've left my keys on the table
Clean your room, please.
Why?
It is clean!
I don't remember
Do you remember?
I've got what you need
I'm recovering from my illness
I'm sorry
It won't happen again
Someone's stolen my stuff
Someone's stolen my things
Do you like that person?
What should we be looking for?
The creature didn't move
Ziri had a single-bedroom home
Ziri didn't like that one bit
Have you cleaned the stove?
It's just a dog
Ziri's teeth were horrible
Ziri didn't seem to be happy
Ziri crawled into Rima's bed
Ziri wasn't scared of anything
Ziri is now my brother-in-law
How did Ziri get up there?
Ziri couldn't leave Rima
How was Ziri there?
Ziri stared into Rima's eyes
Who put the box there?
Ziri had a very, very bad day
Ziri doesn't want to know
Do you believe in God, Ziri?
Ziri doesn't know about God
Ziri's laughter extinguished
It wasn't all sunshine though
Those punks didn't scare Ziri
It's a beautiful country
Why does Ziri go there alone?
Ziri didn't drink much water
The park isn't far from here
Ziri ran, tears in his eyes
Ziri doesn't go biking anymore
Ziri's hair was disgusting
Ziri didn't stop pedaling
Ziri's truck was very loud
Ziri didn't have a bike
The hyena hasn't seen Ziri yet
It's too dark out here
It's too dark down here
Ziri's dogs tracked the fox
They don't want your gold
I don't know solfege
That's not true
Tom didn't arrive at work
Like I fucking need it!
Hey, nice shoes you're wearing
Are they real Nikes?
Strange, isn't it?
Did they get married?
Did he escape?
In short, he's a genius
I'd say at least fifty years.
What?
How can that be?
I'll be there in a bit
Can it be repaired?
Buy yourself a new one.
Is that the whole truth?
This sellotape doesn't stick
This sellotape isn't sticky
Don't use hard words
Don't eat too much bread
I'm the leader
I'll be drinking more water
Doctor, my back hurts
It's going to rain
I'm out of space on my phone
What if she doesn't come?
I'm citizen of the world
The wine isn't good
He slept outside, he is cold
It is a scandal!
They don't use shoes
How will we be getting paid?
Have you ever been skydiving?
Have you ever gone skydiving?
He's a very lonely man
Finally, I can see the ocean
I'm not at my full potential
They're not young anymore
Tom won't exercise
Can you dance well?
Is it free and open source?
Do you speak Berber?
You're an important person
He's a disgusting man
Did you decarboxylate it?
Ah!
This is bad!
To you, what is masculinity?
What can we do for peace?
Smile more!
Could you not include ads?
I can't get motivated
He's not responding at all
I don't tell him everything
I don't tell her everything
I don't tell them everything
I didn't tell them everything
I don't tell you everything
You're not the way you seem
Are you serious, Tom?
I'll tell you when to turn off
He came, finally
Tired, he sits on the chair
Whose are the students?
Do not leave it outside!
The world doesn't wait
She'll be here in a minute
I don't really mind any more
Don't eat too many sweets
Has the postie been yet?
Oh, thank you
Well, thank you
Oh, thanks
Thank you?
Thank you, buddy
Thank you, man
Thank you, no
Thanks?
Thanks, guys
Thanks, man
Thanks, no
Well,
I'll be free at around seven
I'll be free at seven or so
I'll mute you
Don't believe the rumors
My phone's always on silent
Don't be swayed by gossip
How do I unsubscribe?
He didn't tell me anything new
Let's go hunting
What else did she buy?
Ideas don't die
Have you been crying again?
Hannibal at the gates!
It's just your dream!
Open the suitcase!
What did he find?
Did he blackmail you?
This guy's got a heart of gold
You're always in such a hurry
Did you follow his advice?
Hello, kitty!
What's making you purr?
What's the matter?
It's so infuriating!
How many Turks live in Greece?
I'm muted in the chat
Are you angry, father?
I didn't mean to piss you off
They're not young any more
They're no longer young
I can't mend a broken heart
It's starting to work
It was a short-lived pleasure
The pleasure was short-lived
I can't wait for him any more
Are you going to marry Peter?
They're making a fire
They're building a fire
He's a fount of knowledge
Please don't phone me any more
Please don't ring me any more
She met her in the café
My grandson's wife is Russian
You can't eat ideas
The school burned down.
What do you mean, burned down?
I'm not built for that
It's all about who you know
Dogs can't play the guitar
They're trolling IRL
My hamster's name is Cookie
Tom hasn't gotten up yet
Why isn't one a prime number?
Is it raining?
We are in England!
That's a stupid thing to think
Are you the chef?
Rain?
This is England!
Why night is dark?
Have you read other books?
I don't use English every day
I'll study tomorrow
Tomorrow, I'll study
I don't eat watermelon
Is that all you came for?
If Tom goes, so will I
It's in the drink holder
A mile is about 1,600 metres
Long live ice cream!
I don't think anyone's there
It's a fifteen-minute walk
I think we'll stay here
Who do you trust more?
I didn't make you do it
I didn't force you to do that
Where is the house?
Don't leave yet!
You'll miss the best scene!
It's the best one yet
Do what you will; I won't talk
Do you want to start it?
Do you want to start?
I didn't make you do that
You're a young American
Does he have children?
Do they have children?
What did you add?
She didn't like the present
He didn't know the girl
I didn't expect him to come
It's a great honor
We're right on time
You're too self-critical
This is Mary's friend
They don't have a daughter
Can't you think any faster?
Ohio does exist; trust me
Do you know Toki Pona?
Do you know how to speak well?
Did you follow him as we said?
I didn't follow her to the end
You didn't change at all
You see it too, right?
You see it, right?
There's a kitty outside
Why are you praising me?
These candles were Esther's
Hopefully it's the last one
We're a silly country
There's nothing good on
I've got a thyroid problem
That's a birthmark
Wow, big if true.
Look at the little woodpecker!
I'm proud
I've read his will
That one doesn't work for me
They shouldn't get to do that
I'm glad you came around
He's been on a roll lately
He was arrested again in 1999
Why did you hit your sister?
That wouldn't be fair to Tom
What's this black stuff?
Ziri doesn't want apples
Does my cat love me?
Potatoes aren't apples
You're a farmer, aren't you?
It's not a busy day
I'd been there before
Everybody run!
Run, everybody!
Tom's got a gun
Yes, I get it
Ziri hates Rima's friends
Ziri wasn't shoplifting
Ziri looked at Rima's ID card
It's saying the battery is bad
You're stuck in the past
Did they catch the killer?
Why do you run?
I can't run in espadrilles!
Is your head OK?
Don't be scared!
It's nothing
It's wrong
It's not lying
He hasn't forgotten her
I'll stand first watch
What about the price of oil?
I just can't plausibly lie
I've found something here
I can't read minds
Faster !
Many things changed, you know
Did you ever live in Greece?
Let us be optimistic!
Hmm?
Tom wasn't cheating
Either you are wrong, or I am
Either Tom goes, or me
Quit touching the bread!
You too?!
I'm a bit confused now
Don't be such a dupe!
Don't be such a sucker!
Don't just stand and stare!
Kick your legs in the air!
Did I take my meds?
What I don't like is busy work
I sat there open-mouthed
Can I eat that chocolate?
Didn't you get wet?
I'm fine.
Oh, I completely forgot.
What's up with him today?
What made you come back?
I'm going to handle the rest
I didn't know you had come
No one could want me.
Don't say that
You're a catch.
9 out of 10 dogs recommend me
She didn't commit suicide
It's excessive
That's excessive
Firstly, welcome to you
I'm reading his autobiography
Is your father a priest?
Help!
Here's some gas money
I've got gastritis, I think
Do you mind if I take this?
I guess he's still alive
Sorry, please let me off
The ladies don't notice him
You want to eat fruit pies?
Take your time, no rush
Should I buy a wireless mouse?
She smiles, very moving
Am I your friend or not?
It's very dangerous!
So you both failed the exam?
Is there someone you like?
Chance'd be a fine thing.
When did she see the doctor?
Oh, no
Because it just is, Tom
What are Western values?
My parents don't like me
Call me Tom, please
I don't owe you guys anything
Did I answer correctly?
Would you mind if I took this?
You're already in Kyoto?
You are already in Kyoto?
They really sing very badly!
What would be preferable?
Of course, I was expecting it
Where have you taken me?
Guys, dinner's ready!
Tell them I'm eating
He's shorter than him
It's been two hours
That's why I love this site
So, let's get down to business
Things aren't good
He's sick
Love’s screaming
Don't apologize for curiosity
And he’ll put those in my face
Tom's wedding is in October
Dad's taking a bath
Are you gonna take a bath?
Are you going to bathe?
Can I take a bath with you?
Yeah, sure.
Damn it!
I'm exhausted!
The drain's clogged
Mary won't cover up
I'm glad you noticed that
He's an excellent cook
Let's park outside
We're going to Ukraine
Here, have an apple for now
Where's the frying pan?
You don't like Tom's dog
Did he say where he was going?
I don't have enough proof
I don't have enough evidence
You're no coward
Ziri doesn't want sex tonight
Ziri's limo pulled up
I'm a bad speller
The car, Ziri.
What about it?
When it's full, it overflows
When it's full, it's full
Ziri's lips were moving
Ziri doesn't read that
It's trash
What about your friends?
They'll be OK.
Ziri doesn't get detention
Is Ziri a troll?
Ziri's father owns this school
Where is Ziri's spider?
Ziri read Rima's diary
Ziri's tastes have changed
Ziri has Rima's special ring
Ziri remembers that guy, too
Ziri's trick worked
Ziri ignored Rima's calls
I’ve broken your vase
Will you forgive me?
You're not crazy
Do you like these trousers?
These trousers are great!
Where did you buy them?
Stay positive!
We do own guns, yes
What actors do you like?
Do you prefer heat or cold?
Do you have any unusual pets?
Would you like to?
This room's really spacious!
Does he need it?
Of course, I rest on Saturdays
Quit lecturing me!
The rain didn't let up
We can't
She can't
I don't see the star
Yes, she's home
He doesn't need them
I don't have any hope
I'm a resident of France
I'm a French Jew
Walk quickly!
Don't walk barefoot!
I can't walk barefoot
The shower's free
I don't feel like showering
Will they return tomorrow?
Do they want to eat something?
Do you wish to see her now?
Reactionary means far-right
Let’s ask the sales assistant
How much are these trousers?
How much are the jeans?
How much are the shoes?
How much are the trousers?
How much are the sandals?
How much are those?
Let’s check their prices
I'll check their database
How much are these sandals?
How much is the jumper?
How much is the jacket?
What should we sing?
What happened to his daughter?
What is this flag?
Alright, let's meet in a bit
You brought it over?
I'm not cold, thanks
Yours?
What is your company's policy?
I'm feeling a bit blue today
She's sitting opposite me
Tom, what happened to you?
What exactly is his crime?
Didn't you recognize me?
I'm Tom
I don't get what she wants
Of course, you ate the pie!
Who else?
Did you see it?
See what?
What's that?
He's a staunch Democrat
I'll go very slowly
It's a bolt from the blue
I'll buy him a pan
I'll buy her a pan
Just what do you expect of me?
We'll just check
We're just going to check
What do they say?
What century do we live in?
What century are we living in?
By the way, how's your dad?
By the way, how's your father?
I didn't drive to Paris
I haven't driven to Paris
Is it leather?
Ah!
How nice!

It's trending right now.
December 1st is World AIDS Day
I'm not throwing them
My wife can't sleep
Why's Tom home?
Why is Tom at home?
Don't hug me, Ziri
Let's cast lots
Who gave you this book?
Amanda is pregnant.
He didn't have a single rupee
Is it in SWANA?

You're probably fine
Third time's the charm?
No?
Sorry.
Which of the two is wrong?
You don't speak Czech, either?
Can you show your work?
Let's stay up all night!
Save yourself!
The matter can't be changed
What the hell is her problem?
Are you dead?
No.
Then get to work.
What are you doing?
Put me down!
Do not worry, I am with you
Did you lend me those?
Freedom, has never been
Every year, they cheat on us
Ask God why!
It's raining cats
It's a mule!
Give me some!
I guess she's not alone
Thanks anyway, Tom
I don't want to translate that
But it's so boring!
Hello, is Tom home?
I'm originally from Denmark
You're completely insane
Don't worry
It's part of the job
I’m feeling awful
What time do you go to sleep?
What should I get her?
Well, did you enjoy yourself?
This isn't my translation
This isn't my translation
What a cold little hand!
Am I real?
He's poor since he's honest
He's wearing a hat on his head
But what is on the other side?
Yeah.
Seriously?
You guys broke it again!
I'm not repeating myself twice
If you can sing, sing
If you can be wild, be wild
That works for you?
Take out those two books!
Tom didn't mean to offend you
It is vey hot, I am sweating
She's been through enough
He's not worth anything
Can you die for love?
Tom is so stupid, right?
Child, how did this happen?
You guys are ready to meet up?
Don't sleep here
Hurry, pick up your pace!
This is how many?
He's a little bit drunk
Does your country have a pope?
He didn't lend me money
I wouldn’t come yesterday
It’s getting late
Have you seen my sibling?
That's stunning!
You're just like a boy
What is this, maple?
Maple, elm, beech, poplar
That's a maple
Why is Tom so afraid of you?
I have no idea.
Hm, what's her name?
Himari.
Written how?
Oh, I forgot to ask
I went and got a body check-up
Right now it's 7:30
How can I stand this!
What did you guys hide?
Where did you come in from?
Why didn't you?
I'm eating my fill before I go
What's the happy occasion?
Do you understand?
Have you seen my penknife?
Cookies aren't food
He's not coming back
Should we leave?
Let's skedaddle!
My brother's in first grade
Let's get real weird
Destroy their wedding cake!
The pies were piping hot!
My printer doesn't work
We haven't got a signal here
Is this software worth it?
What can she say about them?
What can I say about you?
How are you with cats?
Are you allergic to cats?
You (respectful) are a person
Can you do it yourself?
If you want, I can help you
That's my alarm
Where and when?
Is that really her?
How much does it pay?
It's for the exposure.
How heavy are you in kilos?
The water's still too cold
And here it is again!
Here comes the showdown again!
How did you find this site?
We broke up.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Turn back before it's too late
I get where you're coming from
Don't go wandering off
I don't recognize this place
The weather isn't good
I don't know why he did that
She doesn't do anything
He's got nothing to do with it
You won't miss me
Kamran is Iranian-German
That's very old data
We can't trust the police
So, are you going to retire?
Why'd you pause the music?
I don't like misunderstandings
Don't become a bad person
She's from a far-off land
Everyone stay calm!
He's the captain of the ship
Why can't we go with you?
That's not true.
I know; I was lying.
Who told you such things?
I remember Tom's cat Cookie
So much for Tom's honesty
Let's sit in the garden
Coffee, tea, cognac, whisky?
A glass of water, please.
Shall I cook you something?
What you said wasn't true.
I lied.
Where is your car, Tom?
That's something Tom would say
Is containment really useful?
Did you put a chip in the dog?
Let's be BFFs!
Ziri doesn't know Rima at all
Ziri smelt Rima's purse
Ziri is so, so happy
What did Ziri give Rima?
That's exactly what Ziri did
That's exactly what Ziri said
Is that forbidden?
Who cares?
Who's asking?
Why is Ziri laughing?
Ziri's statement is correct
Ziri wasn't laughing at Rima
Ziri was in Rima's apartment
That's how marriage works
Whose side is Ziri on?
Ziri" is a Berber name
Ziri" is an Algerian name
Ziri" is an Amazigh name
Just let me get inside.
Why?
Why?
Come on.
Ziri doesn't need that anymore
Why is Ziri watching that?
Is that Ziri's dad?
It is.
Watch your mouth, Ziri!
Who's Rima's boyfriend?
Why is Ziri so excentric?
No kissing here, please
Ziri slept with Walid's wife
Ziri slept with Walid's wife.

Don't talk now
You're too emotional
You've spoiled her rotten
No.
You wimp!
What a sissy!
It's really tall
It's really expensive
It's a big world out there
My cats love me.
It's tough love.
This is her car, I think
That's pretty edgy
It's natural
The glass isn't empty
We've met before
Do you remember?
We've already met
Do you remember?
Is that fact or fiction?
What worries you now?
What've you heard about it?
Who told us to come today?
I'm going to ring up Hiromi.
I'd completely forgotten that
I'll wait a few hours, then.
I'm going this way.
Farewell!
Today is Muhya's birthday
Do you like arts and crafts?
Do you like craft beer?
Where did you put it?
Wow, this blew up
Do you want to play together?
Shall we play together?
I've written down where I work
I think I'll stay here
I've brought it with me.
Position: Assistant Professor.
Well then, come on in
Hey, bring some sake!
On the double!
Would you like to be my wife?
We know each other's secrets
Why wasn't he at school today?
He wasn't at school today
She wasn't at school today
He wasn't at work today
She wasn't at work today
Tom wasn't at work today
Why wasn't he at work today?
Why wasn't she at work today?
Why wasn't Tom at work today?
Why didn't you ask me earlier?
We just don't say it that way
Be immoral, cheat and steal
That egg hatched!
Amscray!
Why is it painful to live?
Give me some food,I am hungry
I'm going to eat your apples
I don't know what to write
I'll buy it later
It's always a mad rush.
That's utter madness
Aha!
I haven't found any booze
I haven't found any alcohol
It's a shock, to be honest
I didn't expect that
For 32, no, 33 years.
Oh no, thanks
Twelve's my limit.
What should he do with them?
It's only a rumor
Will it be ready today?
Depends, we'll see.
Shall we take Tom with us?
Why the fuck should I?
Tom, you're a fucking liar!
You've never even said sorry!
Do you enjoy buying clothes?
I’m not so bothered now
Work more, sleep less
She didn't remember you
The boat leaves at 7 o'clock
The ship leaves at 7 o'clock
You didn't know this
They're friends for life
I should've taken it
Did you thank them?
He's always been like that
She's afraid of spiders
You'd better call a locksmith
I'm out of cash
She's as friendly as can be
I'm blind in the left eye
She's blind in her left eye
I'm blind in one eye
He's blind in one eye
She's blind in one eye
I'm home at last
Where are they going for work?
Australia.
Syrian.
You're so charitable today!
You're a huge imbecile
To Ethiopia.
They wanted to go to Romania?
Bosnian.
Lizards are so cute!
Can I go to the bathroom?
You're a cynic
How did they find me?
How long has Tom been ill?
I'm pleased for you
I'm saving for a moped
Let's do it some other time
I'll try to learn it by heart
I'd like to try again
He's not my dad
He's done all sorts of jobs
Don't give me that excuse
Consider yourself slapped!
I don't remember it now.
My head's a bit clearer now
The decision's been taken
We just have to want to.
This book is mine, not Mary's
The sign says "Stop
We have good news!
Tom's a top
Billionaires shouldn't exist
How can you believe that?
We're people just like you
Where did Tom put his bike?
He doesn't know me at all
Did you get my postcard?
Let's make this easy
Ram's complexion turned yellow
It's not a bad start
Sorry, I don't speak Greek
Is Tom their captive?

You're right, dear
Why so many towels?
Why's it so cheap?
Why so cheap?
Show us the way!
Why are there so many towels?
My spoon's bigger!
This is a century-old tree
Tom couldn't have gone far
Do you recognize this man?
No, I don't.
Why don't we drive up there?
Ow!
That hurts!
I'm pleasantly surprised
In what shoes are you going?
I invited y'all for a meal
Don't stop now!
You've got one minute
The cord isn't long enough
What do you like to eat?
I like herring.
It's time to take stock
I need to buy a new keyboard.
What happened to the old one?
I won't dance to your tune
Why did you all gang up on me?
Why did you all turn on me?
You've got nowhere to hide
I doubt you'd be able to help
What skills do you have?
I never lie," Tom said proudly
Tom only wears black T-shirts
Tom can't take a joke
Can you turn on subtitles?
Where did she live?
I thought I'd find you there
I've finally reached my limit
I wish I'd brought an umbrella
I don't have time for girls
At the cinema, Anna meets Ben
Hello, you look a bit lost
I'm Anna
What's your name?
Hi there, I'm Ben.
So, what is the matter?
Why aren't they here?
I don't know
I've just arrived
How many toes do dogs have?
What are you making, sir?
What should I do to get a job?
We should follow Tom's advice
I don't want to watch the game
Are mermaids real?

What are we making?
What are we cooking?

It's hanging up in the closet.

Want a ride?
Need a ride?
How could you betray us?
Hi David, how are you today?
Do you forget everything?
How about your head?
Ha ha, very funny
Oh!
Why do I lose everything?
Could you tell me where it is?
Nine times nine is eighty-one
Will it be on the test?
Do I need some kind of permit?
What's the point of the mask?
Do you need help getting up?
Yes!
Okay, just making sure.
It's like you say
I've succeeded in doing it
I'm not at home
I wish I'd brought my raincoat
Did your teacher scold you?
Did the teacher praise you?
In a sense, you're right
In a sense, you're wrong
When will you get to Boston?
What can I get you?
The Russian ryebread is nice.
Oh well, I don't know then.
Me neither.
The small brown loaf is fine.
Yes of course.
Here you go, here is my card
Is contactless ok?
I think my card is working.
But my machine isn't.
Oh no what a mess.
Don't worry, pay me tomorrow
Bye now and take care.
Did I sleep long?
It's a Hindi film
Welcome everyone!
She's failed
You can't weasel out of this
Did you find your glasses yet?
Not yet.
Did you get my email?
I don't know
Let me check.
You can kiss the bride!
This isn't my first time here
Where's my black coat?
You could say both, I think
Thanks for tolerating me.
He's not far away from us
Did you bring the money?
We're going to have a duel
What happened to you?
I hit my head.
They'll make a new logo
Talk more softly, please
I'm tired of working so much
I think I'll have to move
Cover it up, please
You can't come here
I've never been inside a jail
Five squared is twenty-five
Eight squared is sixty-four
If only she had known!
If only I had known!
Do they understand Kabyle?
Maoism isn't leftism
How much luggage do you have?
We'll never get married
I've run out of soft drinks
Are there matches?
Forgive, but do not forget
That’s how doors work
Isaac, get the golem
I'm a fairy princess
I don't buy lottery tickets
Do you speak any French?
I've had an inspiration
I've never written a play
I've never accepted a gift
It hasn't rained all summer
Are these berries edible?
This river is 500 miles long
What's the area of this city?
This book won't fit in my bag
It's now exactly four o'clock
Who wrote all these letters?
Ziri's story is very juicy
This is Ziri's real life
Ziri's life was not very good
Ziri didn't date much
Ziri met Rima in 2004
Ziri went to Rima's gym
Did anyone call?
Ziri found Rima's YouTube
Ziri typed Rima's name
Ziri's jaw hit the floor
I'll take it with me, OK?
Ziri saw Rima's socials
Ziri saw Rima's social media
Ziri's story does not end here
I don't like any of the cakes
Ziri's plane took off
Ziri can't wake Rima
Ziri's mouth was open
Ziri went to Algeria, too
Ziri's last stop was Algeria
Ziri's luggage came first
Ziri's story is getting juicy
Ziri played with Rima's heart
Ziri's club still exist
Ziri's team won the season
I don't live with her anymore
Ziri knows Rima's name now
Ziri's order arrived
Ziri didn't care that much
Ziri needs to see what's up
Ziri has a fiancée
Deep down, Ziri knew the truth
Ziri's team is in Algeria
Stop following me!
You'll see it on your left.
No chance!
I had to wait hours!
I'll behave myself
Where's my pen got to again?
Ziri learned from Rima's story
Ziri sweet-talked Rima
See you Thursday, Tom
Ziri's date didn't go good
Ziri doesn't do this anymore
Ziri shouldn't be out
Ziri can't see us
Ziri didn't see that coming
Ziri is nice.
Who are you kidding?

What was I doing?
Ziri can join Rima's channel
Ziri's channel started to grow
What's the cat doing?
What are you doing?

OK, Ziri, what do you want?
Ziri can look after Rima's dog
Ziri watered Rima's plants
Ziri made Rima's bed
Ziri never feeds Rima's dog
Ziri's music is too loud

What's bothering you, Ziri?
Ziri can't remember Rima

That's Ziri's son
Leave Algeria alone!
Just pour in!
Take a look!
Have a look!
What does this road sign mean?
I've lost my way in life
Which of these do you want?
Relax, Tom
Tom helps us, and we help him
Why does Tom hate us?
Is Tom still paying alimony?
Where's the spring?
Tom hadn't expected this
What's Tom's father's name?
I've decided to quit drinking
I've dishonored my family
What did that dress cost?
The scissors aren't sharp
Which drink will you try?
Let's discuss
I ignored Tom's bitting remark
Stop drinking!
Stop drinking!
You are addicted!
Leave me!
Leave my room!
Leave my office!
Leave our house!
Get out of our house!
Leave the room!
Wash up!
Wash everything!
Wash yourself!
Wash yourself up!
Have you washed the laundry?
I don't wash my hair
Could he help?
Could she help?
Could it help?
This can't be easy for you
What will happen when I fail?
Keep it!
Keep the keys!
I haven't chosen yet
Years ago, you weren't alive
You are dismissed!
Shouldn't it be otherwise ?
Shouldn't it be otherwise?
What'll happen if I fail?
I can't see without glasses
I'd like some further details
I'd like to see your products
Sir, this is an Arby's
Is Tom your younger brother?
No, he's my older brother.
Look, the asshole is here
Look, the asshole has arrived
They're closing their borders
I think Tom isn't joking
Will you be coming alone?
You're on thin ice
Where did you go in Japan?
Where have you gone in Japan?
Oh my, Tom's bag is here
You're a silly kitty
Marley is Tim's savior
Tom isn't an A student
Don't expect too much from Tom
It's a childish game
I'm not the same as my father
Don't compare me to my father
I'm different from my father
I don't feel the urge anymore
See you Monday, Tom
See you on Monday, Tom
Tom's speech was too long
Tom's speech was very short
Not yet.
I'll deny I ever knew you
Being a good person isn't easy
It was nice to see you, too
Do you need help getting up?
I don't know why I like it
What did Tom forget to buy?
Tom hasn't prepared it yet
Tom is the girl's stepfather
I'm looking for my girlfriend
Did you think about me?
Let's make a fresh start
If you get bored, open a book!
Which of them is real?
Which is the real one?
Don't be capricious
Hi, buddy
Today I'll tell you a story
Don't act up
I'm the one who's bad
After you confess, you forget
I've got my own
I'll keep you in the loop
Can you not slurp?
Don't be put off
Don't be deterred
I don't dare overtake
I daren't overtake
Is "rich but sad" an oxymoron?
Do you guys feel it?
Oh, no!
I'm so scared!
Oh, no
I'm so scared
They're a bunch of idiots
It's chaotic at my place
I'll dream with you
That's not my boat
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a shit!
I don't give a damn!
Have you reached an agreement?
One day, you'll understand
I don't want a divorce
What about our kids?
Do you have grapefruit juice?
Did you go to Boston that day?
Absolutely.
What can it do?
Why did Tom let them in?
We're sure
It doesn't really suit me
You just feel jaded!
Are you really from Germany?
I live in Tokyo, Japan
She lives in Vanadzor, Armenia
Be kind, you asshole!
It's cheaper than smoking
Don't worry
You're safe
That's our father
You need to be here until 2:30
You must do as you're told
You owe me $300
Tomorrow, I'm going to Boston
Tell me which one you'd like
There's a map on the table
We don't have much food left
Where's the cat?
It's under the sofa
What club are you in?
Let's dig up the potatoes
That apple isn't yet ripe
That apple isn't ripe yet
Doesn't that bother anyone?
Doesn't that worry anyone?
Is no one worried by that?
Start the engine please, Tom
We've never disputed that
It's our duty to help them
Where's the cat?
It's under the sofa.
That is not the done thing!
I have little, and you?
I don't have much
How about you?
I'm not finding a formula
I'm sorry
I don't know how
Perhaps you're mistaken
Life begins when you're forty
That's specious reasoning
Ah, its snow!
I'm no one's wife
I don't belong to anyone
I'm not anyone's girlfriend
When does first period begin?
How long were you on the road?
How long were you out for?

Is he still looking?
Is she still looking?
Are they still looking?
She's got a temper
How dilated is her cervix?
She's having contractions
How dilated is her cervix?
Mary has pale, slender hands
So, why do you want me?
I'll go, come what may
Very funny!
You're extremely funny!
Astrology is bullshit.
Is this a frog?
Thanks, Ariel!
What did they mean by that?
She doesn't want to work
What does that mean?
It's exact
There's no use in crying
I've seen similar statements
I've felt this way a lot
I'll be up for a little bit
Would this work in French?
Probably, it'll snow tomorrow
If I get rich, I'll buy it
I don't know what's worse
A few minutes later, Tom came
Which one is your suitcase?
You're changing
When will Latin classes start?
Will you help me?
Gladly.
Will you help me, please?
Of course I will.
Will you help me?
Yes, of course.
The disguise didn't work
I didn't see him
What's wrong with her?
Do you feel safe?
He's missed the penalty
He's kept a clean sheet
So that's why you said that
There's a castle in my town
Since when do you play chess?
I'm the one who ate the apple
How about a game of chess?
Are you any good at chess?
Do you ever play chess online?
Tom isn't from Australia
He's from New Zealand
Tom doesn't live in Boston
Yesterday, we studied French
Mother doesn't know
I've just changed my avatar
It's archaic
I've done the best I could
You aren't being helpful
You aren't being very helpful
That's the fastest car
That's a ship
Be nice!
It's started to rain
Enjoy the steam!
I'm the Mari!
Stop it now!
We're leaving today
Hello, friends!
Don't let go of the handle
Will you tell me or not?
Come visit!
Thank you, young man!
Stay back!
A bit of courage!
We know how!
The world is beautiful!
Is it a river?
Do you speak Mari?
In that case, listen
I'll wash my car
Too long!
Who wins?
Got it guys?
Hey, don't pinch!
Where are my newspapers?
Where are our newspapers?
You can't not go
Don't mix up the threads
I tell you!
Come on, show me
Is that a moose?
Is that a bull?
Why are you being stubborn?
Don't swear for no reason
I'm already dead to you
Aren't you going to eat?
I'm not hungry.
Don't learn things by memory
I'd be scared if I was you
I'd be scared if I were you
That'll teach you, you idiot!
I don't have a period
Ah, thank you my dear
I hope it's possible
What does GNP mean?
Shh!
He's sleeping!
You, keep quiet!
He runs so fast!
Love - what is it?
That's thirty euros
My wallet wasn't stolen by Tom
Don't bother us anymore!
When's the best time to run?
God help us!
That's a strange sentence
Why are you sitting here?
It's a sin to say that
Do not lead me into sin!
Is the store still open?
Is the market still open?
Is the library still open?
Who needs to show a passport?
Which hotel are we staying at?
What kind of building is this?
Where is our plane?
I'm tired and want to sleep
May your treats be plentiful!
Your plan isn't working
So is that it?
Aren't you going to apologize?
There's no excuse for that
I hope you're kidding
I'm sorry, I was wrong
So that's your plan?
This sweater isn't expensive
It's really cheap
What if you forget?
Oh, you remembered?
They shouldn't come here
You shouldn't tease a dog
Lian's eyes are blue
Give me your hand!
How much does bread cost?
She's a good swimmer
Melanie's eating an apple
It's four o'clock now
Give me the journal!
Goodbye, my dears!
Don't forget where you are
When did he come back?
Wow, it's so cold!
Why didn't you call a cab?
One is red, the other white
We don't have to hurry
At my job, I am the youngest
I hope you'll call back
That one I don't know
I don't trust Maria
Speak softly!
Good luck in your work!
Who are you writing to?
Your boss?
Who is adorned with old age?
What's your Yakut name?
Tom, what's wrong?
When will you go to Berlin?
I've been scolded hard
What does the book say?
Don't be slow, be faster
Where do we go uphill?
Let it be a happy holiday!
What kind of sound is this?
I'd never harm Tom
Tom's late
Have you ever had an EQ test?
Have you ever got an EQ test?
Have you got an EQ test?
Tom, you reek of sake
Go over there!
Tom, you reek of alcohol
Go over there!
Who are you?
The Taliban.
Define anti-Islamic.
No, allow me
We had so much fun, didn't we?
I'll get back to you
Don't talk to cops
I don't think it's appropriate
We've had a lot of fun
What are you buying?
Don't send me messages
I'm not missing this meeting
In a way, I agree
In a certain sense, I agree
Will I see her again?
I'm still bisexual
Is the juice from that shop?
Can I have the key?
The train leaves at 2:30
That's a very bad omen
It's a very ominous sign
Everything's going OK
He's very experienced
Don't give in too soon
Don't concede too early
Don't concede too quickly
When are you going?
What's that?
It's a book.
I've never seen Tom there
Tom wasn't there with us
It's a sin to tell a lie
You're embarrassing me
People lie.
I'm still me
Do you go to bars often?
There's a flower shop near by
There's some sugar in the bag
It wasn't a complete victory
These aren't your forks
Tom became a Baha'i
I'm a ger.
What's a ger?
A convert to Judaism.
What order do these come in?
What order do these go in?
There's no shame in being poor
Do I seem rich?
Do I appear rich?
Do I look rich?
Do I look as if I'm rich?
Do I look wealthy?
Do I look as if I'm wealthy?
For goodness sake, get up!
It won't come
I'm from Norway originally
He's a challenge, as usual
He's defiant, as ever
Next time I'll do it myself
She's a person with a temper
How old are her parents?
There's a dog on the bridge
There's a bench on the balcony
There's wet paint on the door
We've been together for a year
I don't know Tom at all
Maybe, you're over 60
I don't scare their children
I eat rosehip soup, often
It's like Disneyland!
Why do you study Kadazan?
Hello!
I'll call him Sim
Shut up, both of you
How are your mum and dad?
I didn't get Mary's joke
It's getting late
Hey, is it good?
What's good about it?
Exactly.
What was it?
It's a secret.
Huh?
Didn't you want me to ask you?
Yeah.
Look, I made some carbonara.
Wow, it looks good!
Yeah, right.
What?
You can't do that
Use it or lose it.
What?
You shouldn't do that
Tom wasn't the same after that
She is eighty-one
I don't share Tom's opinion
His happiness didn't last long
I'm so sick of driving
I'm sorry I upset you
That doesn't look very stable
I'm not going over there
I'm not going in there
I'll stay here and watch
You can't make me go in there
What if you fall?
That doesn't look sturdy
Why do people do it?
Do you stay in touch with Tom?
It's completely compromised
Tom's getting ready for school
I'm not a lab rat
Do we still have LSD?
Excuse me, where's the café?
It's going to rain
It's a storm in a teacup
Who stole my basket of apples?
What would you suggest doing?
I'd suggest not doing that?
What's become of your sister?
You'd better not work too hard
At last it's spring
It's spring at last!
Don't be under any illusions
Be quiet, so I can concentrate
Why did we come here?
I won't be visiting Boston
I know Tom's family well
That man's name escapes me
It doesn't cost 300 yen
Tom's mind broke
I hope I don't see Tom again
Tom hasn't lived here for long
Tom hasn't been here for long
I didn't get Tom's joke
October 20th is Tom's birthday
I'd love to hear your new song
It's pure gold
She's in love
I'm about to turn thirty
Scary!
Don't even get into it
Don't get into it
I didn't get into the details
I'm good for nothing
Let's add some editing magic
For me, a potato knish, please
I'm doing everything wrong
I'm good for nothing
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
I work in a children's clinic
I'm not recanting
I'm buying you a new one
Is Tom on drugs again?
Tom is Mary's paramour
John is Tom's sidekick
That's a pejorative term
I'd only like a sliver, please
I'll take a sliver of the cake
I'm sweating quite a bit
I'm sweating profusely
Even if it rains, I'll go
Who do you think'll win?
Is that a recent picture?
I'll let you know my schedule
Can her story be true?
They're a cult
That's the last time I saw her
Don't dress like a prostitute
How do we do this again?
How do I do this again?
Money can't buy love
We haven't seen anything
Will the sword devour forever?
I've never voted for Orban
We met at Heroes' Square
Have you been looking for me?
Did you look for me?
What are we going to order?
Has he been looking for me?
What about me?
You don't count.
How do you do this again?
It's adorable!
The next flight is at 2:30
This umbrella's yours
Where's mine?
You've reached your goal
There's no breeze here
We'll have this done by 2:30
On Sunday, we don't work
That's the duty of the police
I'm easily angered
Let's get started on our work
Who was this picture taken by?
The ship wasn't damaged
You'd better not drive a car
What a beautiful voice!
Who's got a key to this flat?
If you're not busy, that is
''Nice watch you've got there
Can I have a look? ''
I can't forget about you
Are they breathing?
No, they are not breathing
How can I live without you?
Thank you very much!
I don't think he can hear us
I can't taste anything
I'll dream about you tonight
That's an unachievable dream
What's Tom upset about?
My side mirror isn't aligned
I haven't failed any exams
May I ask you to come closer?
Ziri hasn't really changed
Ziri's club is making history
I've lost my sense of taste
It's my main job
Will you give me a tribute?
I don't want to press you
Let me sleep!
Don't be childish!
Don't be a child!
Stop being so childish!
Are you picking your nose?
It's free real estate
And what if someone sees us?
Let me take a guess!
Alright, I'll do my best
I'll try to be brief
Not bad, not bad at all!
Go ahead, take a gander
Why can't whales get bigger?
Is that dark cloud cumulus?
Fog is only low-lying cloud
Was Tom really her lover?
I'm tired of life
Do squirrels eat conkers?
It's a hate group
Tom didn't really see a ghost
Don't climb that ladder
It's not safe
Everyone's doing it
I wasn't born on Earth
I wasn't born in a hospital
That's wild
Are you a Sinophobe?
I think it's a trap
Open the door for me, please
Odd, isn't it?
We should've already arrived
There's a sign for the WC!
I'll kill them both
So what are you saying?
He's an artist?
Your flight didn't go that day
What plane are you on?
What flight are you on?
You're going soon
You're not very helpful at all
One of you can't come
One of you can't go
Are you in the helipad?
Don't kick my seat
Don't sit behind me
Stop kicking Ziri's seat
I don't really like you either
You can't miss this flight
Do you knit?
Do you have a fear of heights?
You can't jump
It's too high
Can you crochet?
I don't like proverbs
You betrayed us, Tom
Buy me a dog.
I thought you were a dog.
I am.
My mom says I can't
My mom won't let me
Whoops!
Which of you is Tom?
Thanks, God
The bulb wasn't burnt out
Winnie-the-Pooh likes honey
She's an Olympic champion
It doesn't get any cheaper
Where's the ironing?
Don't you like him?
He's posh.
He's not posh!
Aren't you going to mend it?
No, it's too much hassle
I'll buy a new one.
You're so wasteful, Tom!
Here you go – a hot cuppa
That'll perk you up
The left-hand side is port
The left-hand side is port
Why didn't you call?
My phone's battery had died.
Why didn't you call?
Why didn't you call?
My phone battery was dead.
Where can I see him?
Who's gong to help Tom?
I'm very sure I didn't do that
Is that the train station?
What movies are showing now?
It'll only hurt a little
There's almost no furniture
Today I'll treat myself
The answer wasn't correct
Perhaps it's true
Mary's hair is curly
Meat shouldn't be eaten raw
Don't exert yourself so much
Hopefully, you'll come back
My father's gone fishing
My father's proud of his car
My mother's in the kitchen
This must be Tom's house
Today, I turn thirty years old
Maybe I'll never see you again
When are we getting married?
Is it bad for my hair?
She'll lend it to you
I'm going to live in Paris
How's life here?
It's now exactly 2:30
You're not evil
We'll pick you up
Call me, in case it rains
I'll go without you
We're all materialists here
If I can do this, you can too
When you get there, call me
In my dreams, I am free
In our dreams, we are free
My nephew is my brother's son
I don't feel responsible
I'm here for good
We're here for good
She's here for good
He's here for good
They're here for good
I've been there for good
I've beans there for good
How good is good?
How's goods are good?
You're there for good
I'm on the wrong side of fifty
Did my phone ring?
We're not going to Greece
We aren't going to Greece
It's interesting news
I think I'd like to live here
They're ridiculous
They're absurd
Can I see your new flat?
Can I come?
Are there seven of you?
How does this work?
You've got to put coins in
The slot's here.
Unbelievable!
Have you got a room to rent?
Do you have a room to rent?
Have you got a bottle opener?
I'm going to live in Boston
We'll cross the mountain
They're astonishing
Can you wait!
Is Finnish your mother tongue?
We're safer than ever
Where are they taking us?
Let's rest a little here
Let's hit the road fast
Your uncle is a billionaire?
I woke up, too.
It's the algebra
I think I'd like to leave here
I'll try to use simple words
That picture isn't real
I'm used to being rejected
My phone cases don't last long
I'd like to leave a message
I'd like to hear Tom's opinion
Self-diagnosing rarely works
I'd like to see you do this
I'd like to speak first
Who would like to speak first?
I'd pay to see Tom do that
I'd very much like to do that
I'd really like to do that
Why is that illegal?
I don't know
I'm not a doctor yet
I'd rather be my own boss
It's freezing in here
That's useless to me
We don't have any more sausage
The diagnosis isn't serious
I'm thirty years old, too

Tom isn't someone I trust
Tom won't be coming back soon
When have I ever let you down?
I'm not a kangaroo
I'm not a stegosaurus
I'm not a frog
I'm not an iguana
I'm not a snake
Tom isn't in the next room
The ship sunk, of course
You're sexist.
And I think you're prudish.
I'm a scalie, not a furry
Tom's allergic to honey
Tom isn't easily distracted
Tom isn't going to find us
They're lazy people
They're lazy men
Tom isn't eating a sandwich
He's eating a taco
Whose pictures are these?

I'd like to be loved
Tom isn't a guitar teacher
Tom isn't one of my patients
You're very insightful
I'm dead.
No you're not.
Tom isn't smarter than Mary
Tom isn't at home
He's at school, I think
Tom isn't at home right now
Tom isn't a very strong guy
Isn't it important?
Wouldn't that be important?
Would that be important?

May I open a window?
What should we do with these?
May I ask for a favor?
May I ask for a favour?
Don't forgive her
Tom isn't still doing that
This isn't my dictionary
There's so much to see here
How far is the zoo from here?
Tom isn't going to be fired
I'm allergic to sunlight
Whom did you see there?
Whom did you meet there?
Is Algeria really stable?
Is Algeria truly stable?

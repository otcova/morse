We nicknamed her "Ann
Do you wish me to help?
Don't go too far ahead of me
In my view, you are wrong
May I see the room, please?
Hear me out, please
I lost a ten-dollar note
I'm staying in Italy
When am I to contact you?
I was an outsider, so to speak
I don't know all the students
I can't work out the problem
I can't do it after all
I can't help you
I cannot go, nor do I want to
I'm at my wit's end
I want to die, but I cannot
I'm going to Paris in the fall
I'm a poor carpenter
He doesn't believe me at all
Seeing me, she was embarrassed
We beat that team by 2-0
We'll visit Mr Smith tomorrow
It'll cure itself naturally
Actually, it was just a rumour
Actually, I wrote her a card
As it is, I cannot pay you
Don't you tend to get carsick?
Do you like spring or autumn?
The wound won't close
Don't complain about your food
I'll take your ECG
Sorry, but we're booked up
I'll drop you a few lines
Don't mind what others think
It was sunny, then cloudy
Do be quiet!
Have you got a red pencil?
As long as it doesn't snow!
It's too cold today
It's quite all right
Full speed ahead!
It's baking hot in here
We're short of something
Let's not stand on ceremony
For appearances sake, I went
Come on, it'll be all right
Who's in it?
Have a birthday drink!
It's on the house
What does breakfast include?
I couldn't sit through it
It's Saturday
You needn't have woken me up
I'm annoyed by their impudence
In summer, it's very hot here
They moved in together?
All at once, I heard a cry
All at once, I heard a scream
I think it's clouding up
Where did you go to in Japan?
What about farming?
A stormy life?
It may cause lung cancer, too
Let's suppose that he is here
He can't have done that
His re-election seems certain
It's true that he's ill
He has two sons, I believe
He needn't get up so early
He's been to England twice
Need he run so fast?
He needn't have called a taxi
He's gentle with our pets
I believe that he's happy
He'll go to hospital
He's my workmate
He's run off ten pounds
Who is he like?
He's taken to gardening
He fell, twisting his ankle
He'll sit the entrance exam
He was ill, so they were quiet
He's ill
That's why he's not here
I'm told that he's ill in bed
Is he reading a book?
They're not such a bad lot
Her waist measures 24 inches
Let's dance to her song
She's always short with me
Is she anywhere about?
She's a very earnest person
She won't come just yet
She's heaps better today
She needn't go there herself
She waved good-bye to me
She needn't have kept silent
She's of the Caucasian race
Need we wait for her?
As I was tired, I went to bed
It's all but impossible
You know what?
Unlike her mother, she is tall
Where is your mother, boy?
I've got acquainted with them
Could you deal with it?
Me, too
What about playing tennis?
Really?
It's such a lovely day
Hey, there's no pulse
What are the visiting hours?
Don't sit up late at night
Has the postman been yet?
May I invite you to dinner?
You needn't worry too much
Watch out for falling objects!
I'll give it a try
That's the spirit, Mr Suzuki
Kenji's in the hospital?
That's a real pisser...
I know, right?
Why are you following me!?
I'm not angry
Look, see this smiling face?
I won't have it!
No, no
Out of 10 that is
Then what is this, I wonder?
Impressive isn't it?
I'd prefer not to eat that
Do you want to go?
What have I done?!
There she is!
Do you have a match?
I'm sorry, but I don't smoke.
And I'm in Lvov now!
I am an idiot!
Kill me, somebody!
Draw me a sheep!
He's smarter than her
We don't need anyone else
Well, he's a right scallywag
I'm in the sixth form
I reckon the battery's flat
Single en suite, please
I don't give a shit
Trust me, I've been there
Hah!
Some of them are almost $100!
Haven't seen you for ages
It's one mile from here
Has the house got a garage?
Can I visit Madame Tussauds?
Can I visit the London Eye?
There's no rush to get married
Don't rush into marriage
Can money buy happiness?
I'd like to rent a house
Let's hope so
I'm angry with you about this
Why are you angry with me?
He eats non-stop
Don't get caught
Don't get yourself killed
I'd rather not say
I'd prefer not to say
He'd prefer to go on Friday
Do you exist?
Do we exist?
Have you ever seen a pier?
The others can't be bothered
I forget what it's about
No, thanks
I'm just browsing
What's your full name?
Where are the parking meters?
I don't smoke any more
She's a doctor now
Can you make it?
Did you go to London that day?
What the fuck?
At first, I had no idea why
Do you mind if I do it later?
I'd be glad to
No, it's the least I can do
It's no trouble
I'm sorry, I can't
Congratulations!
You're so good at writing
I'm terrible
I'm Alex
Have a good journey!

How many do I have to do?
You're a serial killer
Have you got the money?
I like your eyes!
I am going to kill you!
Bring on the long weekend!
Is she here?
She's annoying and selfish
I'm tired, and a bit annoyed
He did shoot her!
Clap your hands!
I sent your present today!
Did that lady just swear?
This is mine!
Vote now!
We have her!

I don't like beer that much
That is Xiaoli's book
I don't like big dogs
Don't flush yet
Don't be silly!
We're just friends
That's the reason she's late
She's wearing a black hat
You left us, mate
We’ve been waiting for hours
I've known him for ten years
It's meant to be summer
We've picked the winners!
This is fantastic!
You shed innocent blood!
Don't test me
There's a red rose in the pot
It's a huge shock to me
I am very happy for you!
Rob told me the good news!
I am melting!
I cannot open it!
The children's room is messy
Our 2CV broke down

Life is a mirror!
How long are you going to be?
I wouldn't have dreamt of it
Are your glasses prescription?
It's a shadow
Was it like last year?
Let's drink wine or beer
Spring is on the way!
Speak, please
Didn't you see my keys?
That must have hurt!
They're a motley crew
He's eating a crumpet
I don't want to lie any more
I work like a slave!
I retire in four years' time
The ZIP Code here is 14080-000

I'll have you committed

It's freezing out here!

Is money important to me?
I know that I am "un-Swedish
It's best to be best!
I'd like a Toyota
Sorry, give us the bowl!
He's gone completely mad
I'm staring again
Tom's a father of three
That’s actually the truth
That’s what we heard
I'm Máire's fiancé
We all saw it!
Tom is going to Nîmes tomorrow
He just called me a loser!
She just called me a loser!

I changed the baby's nappy
He's a well-known person
Is there a shop here?
Excuse me, isn't it a mistake?
Tah dah !
Enjoy Edinburgh!
No, you're wrong
What's the matter?
Once more!
I'm of the same opinion
I'm very well
I love her, but she loves him
She doesn't eat much
I'm under the tree
Yes, I have a stomach ache
Is Brigitte your friend?
You can't drive
Nice to meet you!
I'm so fed up with everything
Who told you about this?
Where did you meet?
Did you just get here?
Did you see him in the park?
What an idiot she was!
Are you feeling confident?
I'm fine, thanks for asking
They won't waste time
Those times aren't coming back
I'll lend you my book
Give it time and you'll see
Where do you live, exactly?
I'm sorry for disturbing you
Close the window, please
We're having some people round
Am I ready?
Do you like ripe apricots?
What date is it?
Was my phone ringing?
I'm speaking of a lion
We're going dancing today
How so?
Where's your sword?
The WiFi isn't working for me
I think you're stylish
It was updated in autumn 2013
Send me some!
She hasn't got a lot to give
I'll stay until evening
Is this an actor?
Don't be shy
I'm paid fortnightly
They're all the same!
Yeah, say that again!
Yes, you're right.
So I was right?
Guess what?
I'll go to Ireland
He'll go to Ireland
I don't have all the symptoms
Where's Lanzarote?
Tom's definitely not stupid
He's just lazy
How many sisters have you got?
Look out!
There's a lorry coming!
Yes, I like it
How did the trip go?
We have forty-four guests
You weren't tired
I'm going to Stockholm
John's sculpture is horrible!
Excuse me, where's the Gents?
Excuse me, where's the Ladies?
You're doctors
Yes, she's at home
Yes, he's at home
Who could like this?
You're making me sick now
What is her job?
It's a genuine question
No, this isn't a chat
Do they sell Guinness here?
Do you have Guinness?
Do you have Guinness here?
Let's have something to drink
It's a strange matter
Hurry up!
Of course we'll go with you
No, I don't like lobster
It's always windy near the sea
It's all the same to him
It's a beautiful fabric
It's on every Friday at six
It's on every evening at eight
Why is that road blocked?
What's become of them?
It's been six months!
Is that the electrician?
Is it going well?
Is it close to the capital?
I'm in Paris for a few days
What is it?
He's just finished his studies
He's looking for a job
Do you know why I'm sulking?
Because you're never here!
Bring them back!
Do I need a screwdriver?
Brian's all muddy
He's been playing football
The meat's gone bad
He's getting the groceries
I'll arrive on 23 May
It's not what you think
It's tedious
Don't grow up to be like me
It's a secret from Tom
It's kept secret from Tom
Have you got any pencils?
Off with the dots !
I don't want another car
I'm sure of that
Stop bad-mouthing him
Stop bad-mouthing her
Don't tell me you dated him
Hi, everybody
He's engrossed in his book
Do fish have vocal cords?
Dan babysitat Linda's children
Who can one trust ?
That's right
That's strange.
Are you not going to eat?
It was established in 1096
The harvest is more important.
Really?
Well, at least to me it is.
Let's speak in French.
I can't be stuffed.
Hey, Tom.
What is it?
Oh actually, never mind.
No, no
I'll be fine.
Yeah, it's really cute.
Close that door!
There's no way
What did you do until then?
Come on, let's play
I see he's still asleep
He's a dead cert for the job
It's beyond belief
I'm in two minds about going
It's a ragbag of ideas
Oinoë had been fortified
I'm afraid you need a whipping
Handle with care!
I'm eligible to vote now
So—Mary, have you a boyfriend?
Then, how?
I'll go back and sort this
ERROR: No body text!
He didn't know what to do
What if she's gone for good?
She's a sweetheart
We've both been under stress
Is the news good or bad?
There's still much more to do
I was sick, but I'm fine now
Let me fasten my seat belt!
Is this project even feasible?
It fits you like a glove!
This water isn't fit to drink
I'd like you to meet my folks
Whose footprints are these?
I'm in town for one night only
Now I'm full
I'm trying to get fit
Should we get going?
Have you gotten paid yet?
We've been incredibly blessed
Remember why we're celebrating
It's not easy, but it's doable
They'll go on pigheadedly
I can never live this down.
What is it that you want?
I want answers.
Fine, thanks!
The church wouldn't allow that
Have you already arrived?
Now I'll tell you the truth
Yes, I plan to.
Would you like some ice cream?
No, thank you.
Will you meet Tom tomorrow?
Yes, I plan to.
Who did you want to go with?
I didn't want to get caught
Let's do it once more
Buy me one as well!
What kind of person was Sami?
It's rare for men to knit
Do you see my car?
Is your mother still in jail?
My mother is not in jail.
Oh, I'm glad she has got out.
This dress fits like a glove!
Is Layla ugly?
But she's a bit fat.
Could I have some water?
Safety first!
Show a little courtesy!
Have you got any free time?
Mary can't do that by herself
Could you please help her?
It's almost Christmas
Where can I buy the internet?
Why are you crying?
That's disgusting
Merry Christmas, everybody!
It's disgusting!
Can you give me an answer?
That's my daughter
Seriously?
Protein-style means no bun
Nothing's broken
What's wrong?
What's making you sad?
Why the inquisition?
She's my goddaughter
Sami's business skyrocketed
What does a cow say?
How many sisters does he have?
I can't live on $300 a month
When will Tom be back?
Gross!
Light.
Wealth doesn't prolong life
That's not Tom's style
That isn't Tom's style
That's how Tom made his living
It hasn't been 10 minutes yet
Sami isn't surprised
Sami's son was murdered
What is your name?
Quieten down!
Which day is it tomorrow?
Sami stole Layla's piggy bank
Sami stole Layla's tissue roll
Sami called Layla "Lily.
Sami's story got juicier
Tom's ploy almost succeeded
Why are you angry again?
Mary is your niece, isn't she?
This girl is well-educated
You'll come with me tonight?
When you like, where you like!
He's totally gross
Um, was Tom already here?
It's cold, isn't it?
I don't do them up
Is this a ventilator?
I'm well, thank you
We were all children once.
Even Nana?
Yes, even Nana.
That I don't believe!
Can a puffin fly?
Can a kiwi bird fly?
Chill out, dude!
Does anyone have a headache?
Are you OK?
Don’t bother explaining
Because I’m not interested
Don’t fret about it
Don't surprise me like that
Is nobody else coming?
Geez - I'm getting nervous
What's up?
What happened?
What's wrong?
What happened?
I'm rolling in cash
Now, now, just calm down
Morning!
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?
What happened?
Are you OK?
Can nobody else come?
That's right, unfortunately
We don't exchange money
What does that mean?
I don't understand
What do you mean?
I don't get it
Why did you arrive so early?
How's life in Paris?
Have you ever had a boyfriend?
Don’t worry about it too much
Is anyone on Twitter?
Does anyone use Twitter?
I’ll do my best too
Um, what was I going to say?
OK then, please do it that way
The inn doesn’t provide lunch
What do you think?
Good morning!
I'm going to be late for work
I wish I wasn't even born
I told you to wake me up at 7.
Sorry, I forgot.
They’re going out together
Why don’t you reconsider?
It’s already midnight
I don’t want to get any older
I’d like to ask two questions
Don't take life so seriously
“Hey listen!
That’s an even better deal
I've been waiting for this!
At long last!
Would you please resend it?
No thanks, that's not my thing
Have you finished pissing?
Shut your claptrap, everybody!
I’d surely get car sick
Let's go to karaoke
I'm picking my nose
It's a party here
That's a deceitful impression
It's some shitty day today
I don't get the point of it
I'm annoyed with translating!
Did you say this to me?
Man's life is short
I'm an idler
It's my decision!
It's my verdict!
Where's a hairdresser?
Sami's mom gave him some money
I didn't steal that bicycle
Tell me: where were you born?
Give the brakes a rest!
You've changed a lot!
We're relatively satisfied
Where is the restroom?
To the left.
Italian.
How much is the kilo of beans?
Tom mustn't know I'm here
I'm kind of a homebody.
It's never too late to give up
It's good for us
I don't have transportation
I didn't want to get hurt
We aren't millionaires
You're a liar.
You take that back!
That's a common complaint
Is this a new ringtone?
Do you think that I'm witty?
Do you think I'm witty?
Why isn't he drinking?
Because he's Muslim.
Tom's car went off the highway
However, the reverse is true
Do you have them in blue?
He's doing well, thank god
Smell this towel.
Yuck!
Disgusting!
Everyone's scores went up
I didn't have a plan B
I'm ignoring it
How far away is Kyiv?
I've got a cough
I hope he's safe
This is a Kabyle word.
Don't hurt me!
Won't you even give me a kiss?
Careful!
Do you want to eat some?
Don't walk
Don't answer!
Close the book!
We caught her red-handed
I've always wondered why
Do you eat apples?
Bye, good night
Good morning, nice to meet you
That's a boy
That's a girl
Is that a man?
Is that a woman?
He's a man, and she's a woman
That's all we need to know now
Ziri used Rima's bathroom
Full ahead!
We can't come now
Something to think about..
You're so full of yourself
We won't wait a minute longer
I'm deaf and I can't hear you
I've told you no already
Someone's still in the shower
I'll have the usual
When did Ziri start?
He's a breeder
What has he found?
What's in the shop?
I'm travelling to her
We're on our way to him
We don't have to
Yes, I'm a furry
Is that really a surprise?
How much fruit did you eat?
They're giving me an old book
That's Tom's stepfather
Listen, you
You're handsome!
Don't do that again!
Does she work in a team?
Is the machine running?
Mary's always up for a laugh
That's Tom's stepmother
It's cold in that flat
I didn't want any more rice
I saw you together yesterday!
Alice!
Tom replied, laughing
That's all
It was never more than that.
Is the next stop Camden Town?
How are your grades?
Not so bad.
Fancy a bite to eat?
Fancy a cup of tea?
I'll brew up some tea
You got your bike?
It's slow going this week
It's enough for today
Balderdash and piffle!
Tom's a bit posh
Fancy a pint?
Why don't you sit down?
Do you want bread with it?
Does it not taste good?
It's delicious.
Yanni is staring at the food.
He's probably hungry.
Do all of you feel exhausted?
Who would do that to Ziri?
In fact, he's even frightening
Luckily, we were successful
Me neither!
He's a she, not a he.
What do you mean?
That person is transgender.
Why is he alone?
You lost your glasses, sir
Let's say that it's true
Look, I've got enough problems
Tom's wife is Norwegian
Is that a 1 or a 7?
It's supposed to be a 2.
Ziri didn't drink
Yanni.
What?
The windshield.
What's wrong with it?
No shit!
Is that true?
Nothing at all?
Did you say something?
Is that so?
Already?
Can't we play a little longer?
Sorry, I overslept.
Again?
No.
Tom!
Oh, you're here, Mary
Since when?
About an hour ago.
Seriously?
I had absolutely no idea.
I can graduate!
And I was even 6 credits over.
I'm so glad
Congratulations!
Who will accompany me?
I'm not tired.
You're being too impatient
You mean the whole building?
Yes.
He must be crazy.
I've been missing you
Don't you ever say that to me
I'm your father
Yanni is rude, too
Don’t do it, Garfielf
Isn't that nice?
Ziri doesn't know about this
That sounds like a threat.
I didn't do it!
May I try it on again?
Er...
What do you want?
For him, every day is a party
I'm done for
I've been bitten
Because it is right there.
Would you like a waffle?
Today, it is desert
Ready?
Not yet.
Ready now?
Ready.
What's that?
Does anybody know?
Fancy seeing you here!
What has she told you?
You're ruining everything!
No, I'm not.
You're an idiot.
No, I'm not.
Ziri doesn't want change
Did he show you the painting?
Really?
Sorry for making you worry.
Philosophy.
Philosophy?
Nice!
Isn't your throat dry, Tom?
We eat couscous.
What is couscous?
It's an Algerian dish.
He told me that he misses me.
Is it true Tom knows French?
Watch what you're doing
You almost killed Tom!
What do you mean, "this guy"?
He has a name, you know
Em...
What do you want?
The hat doesn't fit me
I don't mind.
They don't have cows
Mary is hot on Tom's heels
Could I please change them?
Society is unfair!
What's yours?
Are you good at tying a bow?
It's so moisturizing
Tom is unsure of Ziri's gender
What's wrong with you, Ziri?
Or don't you want to?
Which drink contains caffeine?
What drink contains caffeine?
Why's Ziri so nervous?
Ziri was rude, too
Is that you, Tom?
Mary, it's been so long!
Three years, right?
Have you been doing ok?
Yeah, like usual.
I wonder if I'm okay
I'll help as I promised
Ah, a Volvo.
Really?
Of course not!
I don't have one.
How about this Totoro tie?
I was being serious.
I'm proud of you
I'm glad for you, too
Are there matches?
Why are you crying?
What happened?
Ah, I might.
Yes, yes, yes.
Nice watch you've got there
Can I have a look?
That's wild
Why don't you ever wear it?
Aren't you going to mend it?
No, it's too much hassle
You're so wasteful, Tom!
I don't feel responsible
I'm seriously wounded
Don't get me wrong
Don't worry about it
I'm doing the best I can.
Oh, yeah?
Do better.
My dog's skin is spotted
We will win!
You call this art?
I like our picture!
The man ate at 7 pm
Alex is a non-binary person
Where do we go after death?
No, I haven't tried it on yet
After supper, he went to sleep
I'm not doing this on purpose
Have respect!
What is strategy, really?
Leave this hive alone!
He will buy Aali's luxury car
I'm going to ask it
What're you gonna do?
I don't think it's working out
Can I use the kitchen?
The motorbike won't start
You'll die in agony
How was the match?
Fire in the hole!
Did you see the squirrel?
I saw the squirrel.
I'm here with you
It's the final countdown!
Yep, that's right
Yep, they did it
It's not that the food's bland
Next week, I won't be here
I don't mind paying you back
Do you know them all?
No, only Tom and Mary.
This is a Japanese man!
Is Mrs. Jackson Tom's mother?
You ass!
Did you eat Luigi?!
Yes, I ate Luigi
He tasted like spaghetti!
No...
It wasn't natural
Don't sit on the sofa
Awesome, right?
I don’t know Luxembourgish
I'm adding that to my wishlist
Where are you parking?
They're not Chinese
They're British
What would you like to drink?
Grr. . . cut me some slack!
It's probably Tom's doing!

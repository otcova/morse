I really like him!
I'll fix it up with him
Don't keep company with him
I didn't get anywhere with him
I'm longing to see him
He is an apple-polisher
I don't think he'll say yes
I believe that he'll do fine
Where is he standing?
He's a future doctor
He doesn't know both of us
He is sharp-witted
He is cool, isn't he?
Is she anywhere about?
She went to Kyoto, didn't she?
Did she come with him?
Mother has old-fashioned ideas
I'm going to climb Mt
Me, too
What about playing tennis?
Really?

Feeling horny?
Don't race the car
My what a narrow waist!
I won't have it!

This is his car, I think
Far from eye, far from heart
He's really angry

How old are you?
I'm twenty-three years old.
I'll meet her tomorrow
Yes, the apple is red
How about a kick in the ass?
No?
It was a last-minute decision
She always thinks she's right
It's so racist
I'm in the post office
He's a Pisces
Don't die!
It's kind of you
We can't do this here
Have you seen the new film?
Tom didn't want to get caught

The baby can't speak
Professor, what happened?
You're crazy, right?
Right.
Democracy is such a fad!
This is style!
How can I go on without you?
I'm not washing your car
Don't tell me what's possible!
Oh, I'm a total idiot!
Did you say something?
Did you?
Hi, Harry!
Tom..
Tom Riddle!
Ha, no!
What?
I am you!
Are you a ghost?
No, I'm a cook!
What?
Finally one useful suggestion!
What's necessary?
This is my opinion, not yours
They're all the same!
Come on, Styopa!
Yeah say that again!
Yes, you're right
Have you been naughty or nice?
Have you a carriage here?
You're pale as a ghost
He doesn't sleep anymore
She doesn't sleep anymore
It's not influential
I don't believe this story
Why should he leave?
That is why I don't sleep
What did she mean?
They aren't dumber than you
Will she live?
You're playing a game?
Can I join?
Sure.
Okay, cool.
Unfortunately, it was a guy
They're speaking together
Do you know me?
No, I do not know you.
I'm drinking
I'm not listening to music
The pig's tail is curly
Carrà uses linking expressions
A coherent text "makes sense

To take the train?
Joey doesn't understand Shane
For Mary, the gun is a weapon

This man is a real freak!
She isn't here now
Do you like the insects?
I'm a bad boy
It's disrespect
At the crossroads, turn left
He's afraid of the dog
What page?
Gilles looks a sorry sight!
What did he do to himself?
What's important is the result
What's become of her?
What has become of you?
He's dishonest
There's a big storm on the way
Why don't you implement it?
I'm not sure what's wrong
Popov is a traitor?
How?
Hell knows.
Word up, breda

Tom is a big-time loser
You mean you couldn't do it
Tom's dangerous, isn't he?
Do you take American Express?
Thank you for your purchase!
Where does she live?
Have you ever been to Tehran?
I should've told you earlier
I wonder what's for supper.
What?
How about dinner?
What's dinner?
All true warriors eat dinner!
Hmm?
I wonder what 'dinner' means.
Oh you—" "Enough!

Or, is it the bagel?
What?
Okay, okay
Here, have this dictionary.
Hmm..
Dinner..
What?
Dinner is supper?
Yeah!
You shittin' me?
Nothing much, really
Isn't that a bit obsessive?
It's just my personal hobby
Can't a man have a hobby?
I don't have a Twitter account
Look, I said no!
Hand it over!
Does this bus pass the zoo?
At first, l was afraid
They aren't bartenders
You go too, please
We can't go without you
Let's keep an eye on that
I'm sure that he'll come
Can I sleep at your place?
It's really not rocket science
I've been summoned by a judge
She's singing in her room
She's smart and quite lovely
She's about to be discharged
She's lucky to have him
She's better in smaller groups
Heroin isn't a good thing
Stay away from it!
Tom doesn't know his birthdate
Are you going fishing?
Get off me!
What an insidious assumption!
I guess it'll have to do
I knew we'd come back
And then what'll happen?
Mister President!
A butterfly!
I'm on your tail
I haven't yet done that today
I haven't done that yet today
I hope Tom will do that, too
Do you see my car?
He was stopping passers-by
I was stopping passers-by
Behave yourself, will you?
The party's in full swing
What's Tom going to show Mary?
Tell me, aren't you hungry?
Wait for it... here it comes
Why is this so poetic?
Would you like a mug of milk?
Tom, come inside!
I've made your favorite meal
It's going to get cold soon
You mean Player2?" said Tom
Could you please stop that?
I'm listening to the music
I don't understand this.
I don't understand it either.
Can he at least write?
No, he won't be able to
I can't help the way I am
That's not happening!
That isn't happening!
I'm not embarrassed.
Yes, you are.
He did his best, but he failed
How much money do you have?
Not as much.
How much then?
One penny.
I'll take the exam in October
Let's go
I'm with you
Everyone, wake up!
You all did an amazing job!
What did he wish to show you?
Who speaks Esperanto?
It is dangerous!
I couldn't understand Berber
Hurry up, breakfast is ready!
I just can't open this jar
I'm dead serious
When will you come to Algeria?
It's a storm in a tea-cup
How are they?
He neither stayed, nor left
You're really an idiot
Tell me where were you born?
Where do you live like that?
He's coming tonight
It's a blanket she will weave
The poor, she got sick
Hi Chaban!
That's all he can do
“I hate you!” he shouted
It's over, he stopped teaching
Like it or not, it will be day
He's nothing if not charming
I do not know where I'm going
Do you know how he's doing?
Your opinion, I like it
Is it an Apple?
I'm glad they are better
Good thing she's better
I think it's ink
It's tight around the toes
Do you know Jackie Chan?
Every single inch of him.
Have you memorized the Quran?
You should be Muslim.
I don't want to be Muslim.
I'm in the living room
He's Egyptian
You touch it, you take it
It's good for him
France invaded Algeria in 1830
My father isn't sleeping
When will you arrive today?
Would you please gift wrap it?
It's useless.
Come back in two weeks, please
Have you heard from Skura?
I believe in God.
He said "You look crazy.
Coffee?
Tom's always busy
I can't get the jar open
Don't get the phone wet
How's that possible?
I'm glad it had a happy ending
A yardstick is 36 inches long
I hope he's safe
Don't hurt me!
Can I help you?
No, nobody can help me!
I wish he understood me!
There's still some left
I'm making fudge
Tom isn't great
He's just OK
It's so useless
Don't walk
Don't answer!
Close the book!
We caught her red-handed
Tom isn't up now
Hopefully, it's not serious
Hopefully, it isn't serious
Make sure you don't drop any!
Follow me and keep quiet!
Me?
Perhaps I should!
Tonight, we feast!
I never liked him, anyways
You can dine here à la carte
You're banned
Tom wasn't here, was he?
Thank you, all of you
Do you guys live here?
Yes, we do
Why?
I'm sure this isn't Tom's dog
I'm going to buy Tom's bicycle
I'd prefer that you stay here
What are they?
Tom said he saw Mary's dog
I'll try to convince him
Don't drop those glasses
She's the wildest girl I know
I think I'll ask Mary out
Who did Tom call?
I'm going for coffee
I've regretted it all my life
My dog doesn't really bark
I've never seen him naked
How do we know it has worked?
Well done, Farid!
I wonder if Yumi is still up?
I'm keen on swimming
Whose skis are these?
Don't worry, kids
Santa is immune to Covid-19
How much snow fell?
That's one of Tom's relatives
What else do you want to say?
Why don't you like skiing?
Do you talk to your neighbors?
She failed her A-levels
He failed his A-levels
You aren't tall like me
Yes.
I'm craving dessert
I never said Tom didn't help
I need more.
Well, there's no more.
I need more.
Well, there isn't any more.
We feel like we're champions
Why will I open it?
How do you plan to pay?
Me neither!
Who came here yesterday?
Tom's wife is Norwegian
So, how was it?
Phew!
That is reassuring.
Does he deserve that role?
Grandma won't let me.
Yeah, for the losers.
Ah, it's alright
I was so angry today.
Oh yeah?
You listening?
What's with this symbol?
Were you rushing?
It's a heart symbol
Ah, it really is
Thanks.
Who will accompany me?
You're broke
I can't relate
I'm coming home at half two
They don't like the train
I've been missing you
Well, that's just super
We're getting wiser with age
I didn't do it!
May I try it on again?
His attitude isn't normal
Don't suffer
How did 2012 start?
Did you know who Maisie was?
I mixed them up again!
I want to buy a 32" TV
I haven't drunk milk
Did he show you the painting?
I don't dare to fall asleep
May I pose another question?
Nice!
Why are you beating me, Lord?
I didn't go to bed
So why are you so angry?
You're contradicting yourself.
Not at all!
Why sentences, you may ask?
Awesome, right?
Do you still deny your guilt?
Tom's car was totalled
Gentlemen, why are you silent?
Isn't he spouting nonsense?
That's not Tom's main reason
Water is wet, but is fire dry?
First world problems.
I weigh 200 pounds
Don't turn your back!
Come on, Rima
Let's dance all fucking night
Death doesn’t exist
Tom hit a three-run homer
Tom asked me where I'd been
I'd like to know Tom better
What's Tom's French like?
Would you like one?
Is this house for sale?
It's not urgent
Is Tom back with Mary?
He hasn't cleaned her room yet
I'm a director
He's wriggling like a worm
Why is it so quiet?
You could've had me do it
Are they Dutch?
No, they're Belgian.
She's Belgian
I won't sit down
I don't know what is Tom like
I don't know him
I'm hurt because of you
Can I sit here for a while?
It doesn't, does it?
I don't like crowds
We're already almost there
I'm already almost there
You can't be so wasteful!
Will you lend me your gloves?
Let's take one more ride
First, she begs for food
Which of you made the sound?
Tom's back twisted in pain
Have you gargled?
Tom didn't remove the sticker
Who kept you from doing that?
Tom didn't read the sign
Don't touch that, Tom
What is happening!?
How many pull-ups can you do?
I'm pretty sure that's illegal
Why didn't anyone show up?
Anything we have, we can lose
Tom, why are you shirtless?
Why didn't anybody show up?
Look what the baby's doing!
He's my uncle, not my father
It's not good to spit
It's bad to spit
When will they come back?
Why wasn't anyone there?
The bus still hasn't arrived
How small is this thing?
He didn't see you
She didn't see you
They didn't see you
Really?
I get that a lot.
How is Tom so smart?
Do you like to eat cheese?
Are you a teacher, Mary?
What do you mean, "this"!
I don't like wearing new jeans
Why wasn't anybody there?
Huh?
That can't be ideal
If I were her, I'd hate it.
Ehm", "Can I help you?
I'll never do that ever again
So mote it be!
Since 2015.
Is this word too childish?
Please don't go out with him
I don't like his attitude
Someone's been watching us
Is Taro back yet?
Yes.
Then I'll pack you some lunch.
Thank you.
Don't mumble, and speak up
I'm sorry for worrying you
Cool!
Go away.
So, where does he live now?
You two aren't coming
I don't care why it happened
They don't let me drink milk
Tom still hopes that'll happen
At least, that's what they say
She's not coming
Tomorrow, I'll be alone
What is the guarantee for it?
I promised you.
Someone stole Tom's laptop
Tom's laptop was stolen
Tom's laptop has been stolen
I promised myself I'd do that
I'm going to hell for this
It's an old word
Pluto is only an ex-planet
Your ex-fiancé is an idiot
You're my happiness
Let's combine forces
Don't resign
Is it not?
That's probably realistic.
You're often too unrealistic.
Yanni's liver was damaged
Yanni's blood ran cold
Yanni caught detectives' eyes
Rima was Yanni's mother
Yanni isn't sure how Rima died
Yanni's wallet is empty
Yanni's truck was missing

Rima wasn't sexually assaulted
Yanni is Rima's former flame
Yanni is Rima's ex-lover
Yanni couldn't be located
Yanni is Rima's killer
Yanni was at Rima's condo
Yanni is behind Rima's murder
We'll have to force our way in
I'll stop by after work
You're late back today.
Yeah..
I'm hungry.
I know, I know
Huh?
Let's stop picking on juniors
I've known them for two years
Stop treating people poorly!
What do gulls eat?
Tom is one of John's friends
Tom is one of John's pals
Tom is one of John's mates
You can't force us to do that
Look, it did it again
Did I just do something wrong?
It's all true
I didn't make anything up
Sit still!
I don't have a thermometer
Why can't we do anything?
I'm Paraguayan
Let's join forces
Isn't this Tom's bag?
Hurry!
We have to act fast.”
You've known me for a while
I was doing the washing-up
I did the washing-up
He's easily upset
We don't have a lot to spend
I'm throwing in the towel
Tom got angry?
That's not like him at all

You've got to get moving
I gave it away.

Where does Tom live?
In one of these houses.
Where does Tom live?
In one of those houses.
We can't just do nothing
Are you making good progress?

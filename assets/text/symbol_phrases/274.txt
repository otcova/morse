Do you still plan to help us?
You should've seen Tom running
Do you still play the guitar?
Do you think we should leave?
Do you understand each other?
Have you noticed any changes?
I don't even know what to do
I'll be working this evening
I've started studying French
May I see what's in your bag?
That's the last thing I'd do
When did you read the report?
Will you be coming to see me?
You like football, don't you?
You'd better not leave today
A true friend would've helped
Can someone answer me, please?
Did you go to the supermarket?
Did you read the whole report?
Did you talk to the principal?
Do we really need to help you?
Do you have a good-paying job?
Do you like listening to jazz?
I couldn've used one of those
I didn't think that was funny
I think it'll be hot tomorrow
We'll do that again if we can
We've run out of toilet paper
You should've eaten some cake
You weren't difficult to find
You've been paid, haven't you?
Do you have a message for me?
A woman leads the way.
Did you take out the rubbish?
Thus he, reproaching
Thanks, DNA!
Have you tried talking to him?
Have you tried talking to her?
Have you tried to talk to him?
Have you tried to talk to her?
March 22 is World Water Day
I admit that I'm a bit selfish

Luckily, I was able to do that
You're no longer my girlfriend
Is everything a joke to you?

That's one way of doing it
I want one so bad!
I changed Tom's mind
Tom won't pass
Hey, that's my car!
Did you arrive safely?
We're just having fun
I bet you can't do ten pushups
I've gotta get in shape
I don't think that was me

That's probably for the best.
That knife isn't yours
Sami isn't serious
Sami is going to Cairo, Egypt
Sami knows Layla's phone is on
What did you say?
Nothing to you.
Tom's house has a tower
Will you do that for me, Tom?
With pleasure, my darling!
You're such an idiot, Tom
Your car isn't fast
Wow, you're such a genius
Wow, you're such a genius!
Wow!
It isn't so easy!

Look!
Watch out!
A duck!
Is this real leather?
It's all your fault!
I didn't know Tom had a son
I didn't know Tom knew Mary

I haven't yet decided
Can you give Tom this?

Can you stay for supper?
I didn't know that before
Can you pay for all this?

Will you vote for Tom?
I didn't know that was there
What's there to see in Boston?
Will you see Tom again?
Can you and Tom both do that?
Tom and Mary aren't involved
Get the door!
Who are you talking with now?
I've eaten enough
Are you almost done?
I can't trust Tom anymore
I didn't say I'd help Tom
Can you get Tom to do that?
Would you like some beer?
How did you know about it?
I didn't say I'd help you
I assume you've talked to Tom
Would you rather not stay?
Would you prefer not to go?
You aren't hungry, are you?
What do the tarot cards say?
Would you prefer not to help?
Would you rather not do that?
You don't talk a lot, do you?
I can't go with you on Monday
I promise you I won't be late
Why have you been ignoring me?
I bet that's pretty easy to do
I didn't know you at the time
I shouldn't have told you that
I wish I'd studied French
I wish I'd visited Tom
I wish I'd called you earlier
I wish I'd told Tom what to do
I wish you'd called me earlier
I wish I'd told Tom the truth
What have they done to him?

What have they done to me?
What have they done to us?
What has she does to you?
What has she done to me?
What has she done to them?
What has she done to us?

I don't like talking in French
Don't fear your fear
Gosh!
I have to grow!
Wow!
I've got to grow!
Open stand / the gates
O blind / with madness!
Thus Ulysses do ye know?'
What were they doing?
I still don't understand it
I haven't understood it yet
Talking isn't doing
I don't like the book
Some people never change!
Tom didn't notice anything
It may look easy, but it's not
Op!
We’re being screamed at
Aren’t we friends?
I'll miss Boston
I didn't give Tom choice
You'll love Boston
I'd hoped to talk to Tom
We'll all go to Boston
I don't go to Boston often
I didn't like it at all
I don't want onion soup
I work in Boston.
Me too.
We weren't in Boston last year
I've already fed the chickens
When is Tom going to Boston?
I didn't know Tom at the time
I didn't say you could go
Maybe Tom won't go to Boston
I don't have a dishwasher
I don't know his name yet
I don't eat a lot of fruit
I don't really like tennis
I don't think it's strange
Tom wasn't in Boston last year
I don't want you to help me
We aren't going to Boston
We're going to Chicago
I don't drink coffee anymore
I didn't receive an invitation
I don't have a washing machine
More work and less chatter!
Work instead of chatting!

I don't like cleaning
I never thought I'd find it
I think everything's OK now
I'll see you this afternoon
I really think it's possible
I think everything's fine now
I've read all of these letters
Where is the harbour?
Is today Thursday or Friday?
Keep those potatoes hidden!
Tom bought a new T-shirt
It's very important!
He's a man with a strong build
Look!
We've just missed the bus
As I tried, I found it simple
Search for work!
No, there's nobody
Sami could see Layla's knees

I'm a fireman
I'll send Tom a message
I'll wait inside
I told Tom where we'd be
I'm an architect
I'm an interpreter
I'll be busy all day
I'll go home at 2:30
I saw you take Tom's keys
I'd rather have coffee
I told Tom I wasn't ready
I'm having a hard week
I told Tom I wasn't tired
I'm not going to dance
I'm afraid to talk to Tom
I wonder who'll help us
I'll be home in a while
I think I've convinced Tom
I'm not always this busy
I think that's a fir tree
I told Tom where we'd gone
I'll go and tell everyone
I'm afraid I ate too much
I'll bring it there myself
I'll find out who did this
I haven't seen Tom for weeks
I'll go home in three days
I'm just telling the truth
I'll see Tom again on Monday
I thought I'd never find it
I haven't seen Tom for months
I suppose I'd better call Tom
I'll write to you next week

I told you that we'd be late
I'll tell Tom that you're here
I'll go tell Tom you're here
I'll make you some sandwiches

I never should've taken it
I'm so sorry I doubted you
I'm very proud of my children
I'm very proud of my kids

I've just talked to Tom
I'm not your wife

I'm one of Tom's students
I'm over thirty years old
I'm really angry with Tom
I'm quite angry right now
I'm really angry with you
I didn't mean to scare Tom
I'm working at home today
I've never been to a beach
I don't have a book to read
We certainly can't blame Tom
I've had that problem before
I've never actually seen it
I've traveled around Europe
I'm waiting for you to leave
I've always obeyed the rules
I've never noticed it before
I've read all kinds of books
I think you've impressed them
I'm not as rich as I once was
I'm not the person I once was
I've prepared a snack for you
I've waited for this too long
I think that's a stupid theory
I'd rather not talk about that
I'm looking for that right now
I'm not going to repeat myself
I've never been a good swimmer
Sami said yes to that, too
Sami killed Layla's pets

Sami was cross-examined
Sami is 100% Arab
Sami wasn't scaring me
He's a survivor
It isn't lethal
This afternoon, I'll rest
Do you like to sleep in late?
Did you understand the end?
I'm happy when I'm home again
Tom hasn't said a word
Be a little patient, please
When will you visit us?
I’m warning you!
I hope that I didn't hurt Tom
I hope Tom didn't kiss Mary
I knew Tom didn't like it
I knew that Tom didn't like it
I think it was Tom's mistake
I think this is Tom's house
I think these are Tom's shoes
I think we'll go with Tom
I think that we'll go with Tom
I thought Tom didn't like it
I told Tom I'd been fired
I told Tom that I'd been fired
I told Tom I wasn't busy
I told Tom that we'd help Mary
I should've let Tom win
Let's wait for Tom here
I have to cut Tom's hair
I didn't want to call Tom
I've heard a lot about Tom
I don't remember seeing Tom
I don't spend time with Tom
I don't want Tom's sympathy
I'm angry because I'm hungry
I'll contact Tom
You'd better find it soon
I won't marry Tom
You'll need help doing that
I won't give it to Tom
You've always been a good cook
I'll be back for Tom
I won't let Tom go alone
I'll bring Tom some food
I'll stay at Tom's house
I'd better go and see Tom
I'll be visiting Tom soon
I wasn't going to hurt Tom
I swear I've never hurt Tom
I talked to Tom and he's OK
I won't try to convince Tom
Can I play the harp?
You're wasting ammunition
Where exactly should I be?
It's too quiet in here
Do you know when Mozart died?
It's very limited
Therefore, Socrates is mortal
Evidently, there is a problem
All aboard, please!
There isn't a direct train
We're not sad
I'm fourteen years old
Come, quick, the truth avow.
You're a good cat
Why were you not in school?
I live in Paris, France
What's Donna's name?
What?
That's wonderful
Is it not?
Are your parents alive?
Today, I'm going to shave
I'm tired
I'll sit here for five minutes
How?
Jane, you COULDN'T!
The place isn't free
Why are you thinking so long?
Where's my razor?
I'm too sick to work
Good day!
Police!
Can I see your papers?
Did you already go to Germany?
I'd like some salad
I won't call Tom
I'd like some yogurt
I'm hungrier than Tom
I'd like some bananas
I'd like some spinach
I'm coming back for Tom
That's a bit personal
I'm afraid Tom will lose
I'd like some red wine
I'm much braver than Tom
It's a bit crowded here
I'm not leaving Tom alone
It's a bit early to celebrate
I'm going back to find Tom
It's a good thing you're here
I'm not going out with Tom
I'd definitely vote for Tom
I'll see Tom this afternoon
Who's Mary's friend?
We must save!
I'm still a little fatigued
I don't work any more than you
You're Mary's brother?
Too late!
I'm already here
Stay calm!
Why must I ride?
My wife isn't doing very well
Can we change rooms?
I'm still a little tired
Why weren't you in school?
I'm still a little sleepy
We're here with our children
I'm not as lucky as Tom
I'm not as lucky as Tom is
I'm not as smart as Tom
I'm not as smart as Tom is
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I'm pretty sure Tom did that
I'm sorry that Tom isn't here
I'm sorry I kissed Tom
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary
I'm sure Tom doesn't want it
I'm sure Tom will be on time
I'm sure Tom will get angry

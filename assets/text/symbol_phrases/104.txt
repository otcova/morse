It's quite a shallow beach
Impressive isn't it
Sorry, no thanks.
Can I have it?
Thought so.
No!
No quitting while ahead!
Next time I'll win for sure!
How about taking a nap?
OK!
Bring it on!

You're doing good work there
Alright!
They're all mopped up!
Jeez, what're you up to?
Please check again.

You feel lonesome, don't you?
Excuse me, what time is it?
You're so beautiful!
I don't know how to thank you
Dear passengers!
That's dead normal
Is that okay?
Do we care?
I just can't forget about you
Is it really all over?
I don't have a sword

She didn't like him
She didn't like her husband
She turned eighty-one
Let's go to a movie
I've never seen him in jeans
In my opinion, she is correct
In my opinion, he is correct
Wearing a suit, he stood out
It's true that she's dead
It's obvious that she's sick
She isn't at home now
I'm sure that she's correct
She's correct for sure
What's she doing?

I'm photographing the woman
I'm repairing the house
I'm running from the girl
I'm looking at the house
I'm writing the fellow
I'm sending her to California
If you smile, I'll be happy
Times, they are a-changin'
How are you doing?
I haven't seen you for an age!
So what do we do now?
How was the French class?

I don't feel well today
He hasn't got a bicycle
How come he didn't show up?
I don't have an excuse
I think he's happy
It's obvious that he lied
How are you, Mrs. Jones?
I took the 10:30 train
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know about his plan
I didn't know about your plan
It's only leaves and branches
This doesn't concern me
You can't park here
I won't forsake you
Great!
There's a phone call for you!
This is his car, I think
This is his umbrella, right?
I don't know her address
We weren't at home yesterday
Battery is low!
It's started to snow
That's my idea
That is the absolute truth!

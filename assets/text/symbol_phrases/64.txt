His wife is beautiful, too
Tom is worried he'll get lost
What's my next move?
Have you eaten your sandwich?
He didn't drink his wine
He's really into Skura
She's in his bed
That's not a real smile
What's the secret to his job?
He's not her type
I'm your worst nightmare
I'm their worst nightmare
He's a pretty good detective
You're a great girl
Let's watch the movie
He's flying home today

It's just a storm
This is Skura, my girlfriend
You're lying

What's your game?
I don't have a game.
How did you even meet him?
He bought a pair of flip-flops
He's obviously after her money
I'm from an island
I'll talk to the police
Goodnight, Skura.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
I'm here and ready to work
She's joining our sorority
It's a noble tradition

He can't stay in my room
He's a messy cook
Can I use your shower?
That club isn't for everyone
He's a court reporter
She's a disaster
Why is he all dressed up?
Who gave him the password?
Why are they so scared of me?
Will you marry me?
Of course I'll marry you.
Why are you panting?
Why are you panting?
Because I have been running.

He's a criminology major
He hit on Skura's daughter
It's time for tea
That's it
I don't hear that every day
You're a good man.
I don't hear that every day.
You're an amazing dad.
I don't hear that every day.
Lions don't feed on ants
It doesn't affect me at all
I didn't do it for me
You don't speak much anymore
He's gone red
She's gone red
No one's perfect, except me
Nobody's perfect, except me
Get up, you're gonna be late
Put some effort in!

He's hungry
She's hungry
They're missing a player
We've only lost by a goal
I'm going by plane
He's thirsty
She's thirsty
She sings so well!
I don't want to be interrupted
I don't think of it as a game
He's focusing on his career
When will they marry?
Never.
She hit me.
I did not.
She started it.
I don't care who started what
Just keep it down.

How did they get his DNA?
Who would say no to this?
Do you have his number?
By the way, how was your date?
You're a mother.
So are you.
He's terrible at doing that
He shouldn't be so negative
That's not your joke
That's Jim Carrey's
I've seen her picture
What's the matter with that?
He's an architect
He doesn't like dogs
He doesn't own dogs

What's the problem then?
I can't stand his daughter
You're an excellent driver
Is this Algiers?
This isn't a contest
I'm also drinking wine
She's a famous actress
So what do you do for fun?
I am your next-door neighbor

I hugged Tom, too
I liked Tom's car
I like Tom's car
I like Tom's dog
I met Tom in 2013
I read Tom's note
I didn't read Tom's note
I didn't know Tom was waiting
I stole Tom's car
I told Tom that I'd won
I told Tom I'd won
I took Tom's book
I didn't take Tom's book
I didn't treat Tom well
I adopted Tom's idea
I used Tom's idea
I stole Tom's idea
I eyed Tom's plate
I've grown
I've got one
I've matured
I've grown up
I've been paid
I haven't been paid
I've come back
I've done well
I've fired Tom
I've got a boat
I've got a lead
I've got a rash
I've located it
I've never lost before
I've stopped it
I've tried that
I've been trying
I've done enough
I've earned this
I've earned this vacation
I've wronged you
I've just begun
I've been drugged
I've been paroled
I've been patient

I'm shaking like a leaf
You're so selfish
Challenges don't scare me
I'm just a little tired
That's all
Yes, it's an appetizer
Yes, it's a starter
It's not wrong, is it?
It's wrong, isn't it?
Tom can't keep secrets
I won't be home this weekend
Let famine spread!
I'm fine too, thanks
It's all my own doing
I can't stand him
What can I do?
Born bad or made bad?
Don't try to trick me
I'm not falling for it
I can't stand it any longer
You're all sweaty
Give me the money!
Over my dead body!
With your permission !
Of course I love him!
Do as I say, not as I did
I can't catch a break today
There's only one mother
Don't touch me
I can't wait to go on vacation
He's an open-minded person
He's a worthless piece of crap
I don't like competition
You're such a good-for-nothing
Is your math homework done?
Please, go and take a look
I didn't say Tom was to blame
I'm not saying Tom is to blame
Or, will it become reality?
You're now taller than I am
Will there be sailing ships?
I know it isn't easy
Are women interested in Mars?
Laura’s studying languages
Are you a mouse as well?
I don't know both of them
I'm not a political expert
He's a true artist
Come here, let me hug you
It's adorable
The past doesn't come back
He replied: – Of course!
You're my addiction
Can't you walk faster?
Can't you come sooner?
I see you don't miss a thing
I'm freezing to death
Let's have a break
Want me to go with you?
Mom, Tom is copying me!
I'll remind you
I'll remind you about it
I'll clean the kitchen
Are you leaving tonight?
Are you on your way tonight?
Is he a bachelor?
It'll soon be dawn
Do you have headphones?
Have you got any headphones?
Do you have any headphones?
Is the drawing finished?
Is that drawing finished?
Would you like to eat alone?
Do you wish to eat alone?
Here's the money for the fare
I'm glad you ask
Don't beat around the bush
I'm lost," he declared
Isn't that too dear?
Who is funding your project?
I'm coming round tomorrow
I'll pop round tomorrow
Have you achieved your goals?
Did you achieve your goals?
It's cold there even in summer
The weather's bad today
I'm nobody's doormat
Did I give you the key?
Do you realize that?
You were always mom's favorite
We can not say it better!
That is well said!
Wait until 2:30
Wait till 2:30
I wish I'd brought my camera
You'll have to cut the grass
It's rude to stare at someone
Do you think I'm having fun?
I couldn't go outside
It's time to live
His watch wasn't valuable
She's my girlfriend now
Why?
You want to come along?
How long did you swim today?
Do you eat oranges?
How long did you swim today?
Three hours.
I've never felt loved
Tell me you aren't kidding
Tom didn't sit with us
I don't believe this theory
Because I'm innocent
Money isn't everything in life
I'm going to the supermarket
Will you keep me company?
I can't drink Japanese wine
I can't drink sake
Yes, there are appetizers
Yes, I will put snacks out
I tripped, but I didn't fall
It's not that the food's bland
We'll manage somehow
Should I be worried?
These shoes aren't warm
Why am I telling you all this?
You can't get up yet
Can you lend me your rubber?
Can you lend me your eraser?
What do you want me to say?
Doesn't matter
Just say anything.
Apple tree, apple tree.
Don't walk under the ladder
Don't you recognise me?
I can't see anything, either
I can't see anything either
Don't go out alone
Where's the dirty washing?
I've just got your message
Can I borrow your rubber?
Shall we get started, then?
I've got to go to the library
They're looking for volunteers
We haven't got a big flat
Our flat's not very big
What's on telly?
What's on the telly?
What's on television?
Next week, I won't be here
I'm not an ass-kisser like you
She's a very quiet person
I can't walk
How long did you swim today?
Who did you swim with today?
Who swam with you today?
What did they want from you?
It's all hoarse
Where can I do my homework?
What's wrong with your leg?
That's starting to bother me
Is Tom snoring?
Do you want a chocolate bar?
I'll leave when you leave
I'll eat when you eat
You're a resourceful person
Ziri's life is changing
It's Ziri's life
Ziri's wife is black
Ziri doesn't want to hurt Rima
Beauty isn't everything
You're a talented person
Where's the book?
It's on the table.
I can't hear anything
I'm deaf
It's the boss.
Wish me luck, Ziri.
Wish me luck, Ziri.
Did they ask for some coffee?
Does she want some more tea?
Does he want some more tea?
Let's go to the zoo tomorrow
Tom isn't a reliable person
Did they love me?
Come to bed, Ziri
What's redneck music?
Why is Ziri an atheist?
I'm not an old-fashioned guy
A different pillow, please
Could you get me another one?
It’s a bargain with the devil
Tom and Mary both died in 2013
Fortunately, nobody died
He's an old style man
What's so great about Boston?
I can't meet Tom
This is how grown-ups have fun
I work hard, and play hard
Am I ever going to matter?
What do I want to do?
Why do you need a crowbar?
You must've misunderstood Tom
You must've heard me wrong
Do you want some lunch, Ziri?
How did Ziri get home?
Don't get stroppy with me!
We can't go that way!
There's a "no right turn" sign
I've run out of cotton wool
I've two.
And I have three.
Tom hasn't washed his car yet
Of course not!
Who was he flirting with?
Who was she flirting with?
Who was Tom flirting with?
I wonder what he's thinking
I wonder what she's thinking
You're the new kid, right?
We're good at pretending
Which job would interest you?
Let's put up Christmas lights
Is it a real tree?
25
Tom ruins people's lives
What the hell is this?
Fuck if I know.
You damned bitch!
God, what did I just read?
That's a matter of perception
So is it yes or no?
He's a secondary school pupil
It's not a bad thing in itself
How does one become a fairy?
I've got terrible toothache
They're both wearing hats
They've both got a hat on
I rang her, but it was engaged
Tom likes cross-country skiing
We've got to unload the lorry
Your tie isn't tied properly
I'd like a glass of tap water.
That'll be a euro
A fine thing that would be!
We are friends, aren't we?
It's very cloudy
I'm sure it's going to rain
You what?
How are stars formed?
Is Mary your girlfriend?
No, we're mates.
What was in the letter?
What did the letter say?
I haven't got a telly at home
Have you fed the parrots?
Well, that's your loss
Yes, don't worry
Well, it's not going to help
It still doesn't ring a bell
This one's for you!
I've brought you your dessert
Are you going to stay?
You're staying?
I'll buy him a chick
I'll buy him a pencil case
I'll buy him a jug
Maybe not tonight...
Why not?
All right then.
I'll buy him a hammer
I'll buy him a van
I'll buy him a broom
I'll buy him a volleyball
I'll buy him medlars
I'll buy him a suitcase
I'll buy her a blouse
I'll buy him a television
Let's go out for a walk
Water is essential to life,
No one liked Tom, except Mary
How many horses did you see?
This one's for Tom
He's a real fool
She's fond of cake
He's suffering from a cold
She's working on the problem
He's standing on the stage
Luckily it didn't overflow
I don't even know her name
How did Tom verify that?
It's still inconclusive
It doesn't mean anything yet
I'm going to marry her.
It's not going to work out.
You don't need to provoke me
Let's sing a patriotic song
U-turns are prohibited
No U-turns
I'm getting sentimental
Don't get so sentimental, Tom
Don't shut me up!
I'm a policeman by profession
By profession, I'm a policeman
I get it!
Why?
One word: Mary.
Don't worry
There's still plenty of time
He's no doctor
He's a paramedic
Vacations are fun!
You shouldn't do it
Well, it won't help
Well, it's not going to work
You'll just waste your time
I'm going to marry her.
You shouldn't.
I'm going to marry her.
You shouldn't do it.
You don't have to shout
I'm a full-time mother
See you in 2022!
What is your self-image?
By your standards, I'm useless
What's your field of work?
What field are you in?
Why did Tom take such a risk?
I can't speak English
Why would I lie about this?
Give me the money.
Take it.
He's denying the obvious
You're being stupid
When was this museum built?
This isn't certain yet
I'm not here to threaten you
I'll turn your life into hell
Do you need any more time?
Who's that coppertop?
Did Tom go to work today?
Why is everybody so busy?
We aren't gay
Did Tom and Mary order coffee?
What are you staring at?
He had a well-built body
Learning Chinese is hard.
Don't learn it.
Learning Japanese is hard.
Don't be a pussy
You can't see an awful lot
Aren't you afraid of that?
Let's look on the internet
It's a nervous tic
Have you had your booster jab?
I was talking to him, not you
You needn't thank me
What did he ask you for?
Do you know them all?
No, only Tom and Mary.
Can you feel anything?
Nothing whatsoever.
Are you fucking with me?
I can hardly remember her.
Mum's back from shopping
No, you don't need to do that
No, you needn't do that
Did you stay at home alone?
What time is it?
I don't know.
Give me a rough idea.
I haven't got a rough idea.
Can someone else answer?
I can't stand loud noises
Could someone else reply?
I'm nicely combed and shaved
Oi!
Get in!
He is part-Inca
I'm not very good at skating
I'm not very good at driving
I'm not very good at juggling
The ladder isn't tall enough
Were you just talking to me?
They're pretty friendly guys
Making friends isn't easy
It isn't easy to make friends
Can't I do anything right?
I'm going to go join Tom
It's my first day on the job
It's force of habit
Don't wake me up when I sleep
How old is this truck?
How old is your computer?
Who took the suitcases?
Mary was late, too
Shoot, my battery's low
He's as poor as can be
She's amiable to everybody
He's a very decent fellow
She's fond of playing tennis
He's not kind to her
She's a very nice person
He's employed on the farm
She's very hardworking
He's a Japanese boy
Let's find it
You've cut down a tree
What is your true essence?
This Japanese man!
I'm going to sit in the front
I know you don't really care
You are a worthless lawyer!
Can I take your photo?
What type of rice is this?
He died in 1960
I realize I should've called
Ann's mother is fat
Tom can't take Mary with him
I'll check on that later
It's just an educated guess
You'll recover
Tom didn't stop shouting
Call off your hounds!
I'd say it's worth a try
Tom won't be allowed in here
What's "manliness"?
Sod off.
What's "femininity"?
That promise hasn't been kept
Where's Tom off to?
Thanks a lot!
My pleasure!
Don't be too quick to answer
I can't hear Tom anymore
Do these pieces fit together?
Three-day stubble suits you
Did I make a mistake again?
I think Tom does, too
We're going to have to wait
That's Cookie's gravestone
Tom isn't a doctor
He's a paramedic
I was talking to Tom, not Mary
Do you know where it is?
Did you like the quiche?
I won't be here for long
I've waited for you
Why should Ziri help Rima?
It's the pure truth
Tom said that he couldn't stay
Where are you waiting for me?
Where is the shopping?
Where is the book?
The book is on the desk.
Where is Tom?
Tom is in the car.
Do you speak Hungarian well?
Did they speak Hungarian well?
What do turtles eat?
I couldn't see his face
I don't buy the story you told
Tom and I aren't in the class
You're just a dickhead
Hell doesn't scare me
He's an insecure guy
Let's take a smoke break
Let's play?
Did you take a screen shot?
What am I to you?
What is your surname, please?
I think it's quite good
I reckon it's quite good
I can't find my house keys
Have you welded it?
I didn't receive your message
Use your loaf!
She says she hasn't seen him
Was it perhaps his brother?
Where does this door lead?
Where does that door lead to?
How beauteous mankind is!
Someone said you'd got ill
Someone said you'd fallen ill
No, not really.
Have you gone barking mad?
Do you still love Tom?
We've arrived at the station
Tom is Mary's dentist
Have you mown the lawn?
I haven't got round to it yet.
That's to our advantage
Is Tom there?
No, he's not here.
Can I leave her a message?
I didn't get your message
Let's break the mold
Please don't rush me
When did Tom arrive?
Just before Mary did.
Why are tardigrades so cute?
Why are puppies so cute?
What did Mom and Dad do today?
It's a unique challenge
He really liked Rolls-Royce
I've eaten boiled eggs
It'll take a day or two
How did you split your lip?
I don't understand the news
Tom still hasn't read his mail
How can you doubt that?
I'm no longer married to Mary
Tom seems like he's in pain
Tom returned Mary's call
Tom's screaming woke Mary up
I'm kind of in a rush today
What does music mean to you?
He's been blind since birth
I can't sell myself
The answer isn't simple
That's not her real name
That's dark, Tom
She's on the rag
That's one way to explain it
Did you get them back?
Is Tom a bachelor?
That's that
That's the case
Don't worry
I won't let you down
Are you spying on someone?
How happy I am," she said
It's time for Tom to step down
She's safe here
That's the way she is
We didn't buy any bread
A portion of chips, please.
Salt and vinegar?
Yes, please.
It's hard to disagree with you
Did you look in the fridge?
Did you get me something?
See for yourself.
Is Tom going to work tomorrow?
Why don't you wink at Tom?
Let's play a duet
Ah, as for me, ..
We're both nuts
They lost again.
You don't say
Death can't stand you
It's late, so go to bed
I should've thrown it away
We couldn't get any closer
She's muttering to herself
He's in the prime of life
He's a work horse
She's after a better job
He's an intelligent boy
He's an expert in astronomy
He's a good loser
She's gentle
He's apt to be late
Of course, Tom denied that
Tom denied that, of course
We hope you'll be here
He's in pajamas
You don't want this?
We don't want to believe him
Does it gross you out?
How can they still be here?
It's a great tool
Tom said it'll rain
It's time for this to all stop
I'm no match for your smile
Tom isn't a member of our gang
He has a dinosaur on his head!
How do you usually say it?
I think I'm doing a good job
I'll stop later.
Why didn't you come on Monday?
Hmm, I don't really know why.
What?
Oh, never mind that
Now eat your food.
She's out of her coma
You put ketchup on your eggs?
Can that be true?
What's the key to happiness?
Where's the key to this door?
You know we can't discuss that
When will you get a crocodile?
He won't play tomorrow
I'm not getting along with him
Tom got inside, somehow
We've decided to give it a try
Don't try to haggle with me
You're the joy of my life
Well, I guess I did say that
We're not open on Sunday
That isn't a monkey
It's Tom
We didn't know what to say
I'm starting to love myself
Isn't that what people want?
I don't worry about money
Here's your unemployment check
Cool!
Is that OK?
Sure!
Which do you say more often?
But I cannot speak English.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Are you Japanese?
I am an alien.
Ah, I gotcha!
Two 45-cent stamps, please
I've cleaned your room
That's not a monkey
That isn't a monkey
That wasn't a monkey
I know all about boys.
Oh yeah?
How do you know?
I'm a boy.
That's not how I imagined it
It's not the way I imagined it
We aren't open on Sundays
Yes?
How can I help?
Can you describe them to me?
They're in a black case.
Who has the key to this door?
Do you put ketchup on eggs?
I'm coming with you.
You stay there!
Cracking idea," was the reply
I'll bring a few nuts with me.
You've come at the right time
I'm honoured to be here
Tom, where's my coffee got to?
There in a minute.
He's nothing but a fool
Who knows where he's got to
Who knows where it's got to
Express yourself clearly!
He's second to none
He's such a lazy fellow
She's an obstinate girl
He's a dramatist
He's fresh from college
She's good at swimming
He's a lazy fellow
Nature can't be changed
I think we're all happy now
We've finally found each other
Can I pet your cat?
My hair wasn't long last year
That's how Tom always says it
Ow!
Why did you kick me?
How should I tell Tom that?
What would you suggest I say?
What would you suggest I do?
What would you suggest I buy?
This isn't any good
This isn't very good
I'll hold it up
Is Monday OK?
How about Monday?
Monday isn't a good time
Can we do it Tuesday?
Did you get back at them?
Did you get them to come back?
Tom has been bad-mouthing Mary
Tom told me he didn't love me
Tom can't call Mary now
Tom can't talk to Mary now
Tom can't find his passport
Tom can't find his glasses
Tom can't be around Mary
He's inclined to be lazy
She's very fond of flowers
Don't translate me!
Tom can't see Mary today
That's our next step, I think
Can I have a look at that?
I'm certain I locked the door
I'll do this again tomorrow
I did this yesterday, too
It's very worrying
Tom's suggestion is a good one
What's in that drawer?
What's in the top drawer?
I promise you I'll be ready
It's time we said goodbye
I tried to do this, too
Who gave you this money?
People here don't like Tom
Who ate my dessert?
Are those your horses?
Can you show me another one?
I've just made coffee
Do you want a cup?
I've just made coffee
Would you like some?
Do we have any cake left?
Is this your coat?
Do we have any ice cream left?
They amputated Tom's right leg
That wasn't a good fit, either
He's above deceiving others
He's his usual self
She's engaged in social work
There's no rush
I do worry about Tom's health
He's as talkative as ever
She's anxious to go abroad
He's no better than a baby
It's been a real challenge
How old are your sons?
Tom is still Mary's husband
Tom doesn't know who shot Mary
It just doesn't fit the need
He's good at riding horses
He's a total stranger to me
You'll have to wait outside
He's Japanese by birth
Tom is one of Mary's clients
He's good at mathematics
He's tremendously handsome
He's an agreeable person
He's a careful player
He's a good man at heart
He's busy with job hunting
He's seeking employment
Tom doesn't hang out with Mary
Tom is still Mary's spouse
Tom is still Mary's partner
Is Mrs. Jackson Tom's mother?
We can't stop doing this now
It's an emergency
I just can't stand him
I'm not sure who that man is
We'll be eating pretty soon
We'll be eating at noon
Please don't wait for us
Tom doesn't know Mary's family
Tom doesn't eat meat at all
Tom doesn't show his feelings
Who made these sandwiches?
I didn't bring my tools
Tom disagrees, doesn't he?
It's been an amazing ride
Tom doesn't agree, does he?
We need to do what's necessary
Does Tom like to dance, too?
Who gave you all this stuff?
I bet Tom won't be back today
I'm going to keep doing this
Did Tom do a lot today?
Did Tom buy a lot today?
Did Tom eat a lot today?
Did Tom do much today?
I'm not sure when Tom left
Tom doesn't think Mary snores
How does it all fit together?
Tom doesn't want Mary to drive
I'm still worried about that
Tom is my right-hand man
That's a load off of my mind
I'm not sure where my keys are
I'm not sure who she is
How old are your daughters?
Don't worry
I'll think of something
There's a lot I have to learn
Tom doesn't talk about Mary
Now, leave the rest to me
I hope we don't run into Tom
Tom said he'd been shot
Well, don't just stand there
Take your hands off me, please
Tom doesn't buy seafood
Are these your suitcases?
Tom doesn't worry about Mary
Happy New Year 2022/2972!
Sorry, but you can't sit here
Let's not worry about that
Tom doesn't want Mary to sing
When do you work out?
There's plenty to worry about
I'm no stranger to pain
It's supposed to rain later
Let's just get you home
I'm not sure who did this
Could you please excuse us?
Don't worry about me
I'll be fine
Tom didn't blame Mary at all
It's a challenge for us
We'll get it sorted out
It's been a challenge
I'm powerless to stop it
Don't let me stand in your way
Get out of the way, please
Tom doesn't know I like Mary
It's time we got out of here
Murder isn't the answer
Who do you work out with?
Tom says he hasn't seen Mary
How often do you work out?
I'm not sure who that woman is
The race isn't over yet
Tom said he'd been hurt
Down with dictatorship!
It was a madhouse!
Yes, I can agree with that
What's our market share?
It's just the luck of the draw
And what do you know about it?
We're here to thank Tom
Tom said he's done that
They didn't charge me anything
Don't worry about me
I'll be back
I'll see you later, Tom
It's time for a reality check
Don't expect any changes soon
Is this your cane?
Promise you'll help me
I guess that's it for now
Can that really be true?
Tom doesn't know I hate Mary
Don't worry
We'll be right back
It's the inside that counts
She can't come either
It's really surprising!
You've done it on purpose
You'll get over it soon enough
Don't cause a scene here
May I eat something now?
I'm planning a trip to Boston
Don't expect much to change
I'm not sure when I'll arrive
It's a good challenge
That's where I draw the line
Can we stop doing this now?
Tom got Mary's message
Once I sat down, I felt OK
Do they sell champagne here?
He's a promising young man
Do vegans eat cheese?
Where are you?
I'm in the square.
I won't help him
Why is a banana curved?
He's young, so it's forgivable
What makes magnets so magical?
I'm a Bulgarian from Bulgaria
I'm Bulgarian, and you?
I'm a Bulgarian, and you?
I'm Japanese
He's exceptionally handsome
He's in a poor state of health
Is it dearer to eat healthily?
Will you give me a lift there?
Will you give me a lift?
Would you give me a lift?
The BBC was founded in 1922
The BBC's centenary is 2022
She's waiting outside the room
Are we disturbing you?
No, not at all!
Come and sit down.
Have they gone mad?
I'm used to the cold
Where did you live?
Amsterdam.
Where were you living?
In Amsterdam.
It's Tom's birthday today!
No!
Is it?
We've got used to the cold
What is there to drink?
Water or fruit juice.
Who told you not to tell Tom?
I want to die.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
I guess it could've been worse
She is a real know-it-all
Can you write that down?
Why isn't he coming?
You should be ashamed!
My aunt's child is my cousin
Did the interview feel good?
Is the worm alive or dead?
This one doesn't cost anything
That guitar isn't tuned
What does it change?
What do you want in Tokyo?
You can't go in
She's very happy
But how do you do?
At the next corner, turn left
At the next corner, turn right
Dad, what is politics?
I'm selfish with you
Have you pulled the plug out?
Did you pull the plug out?
I woke at five o'clock
I wish he'd write more often
He didn't want her to leave
He wouldn't drink anything
He didn't want to drink
Yes, please.
You're late again, Tom!
I'm sorry
I'm afraid I overslept.
I'm happy you're here at all.
In the end, she didn't turn up
She didn't come in the end
We'll get to the bottom of it
How was your exam?
So-so.
Eat, don't be shy
You're dead!
Don't grow up
It's a trap
I can't speak English
Bye.
See ya!
I will.
Right.
You live in a pink state!
What do you mean?
I can't wait here any longer
We can't do it better
I'm very disappointed, Tom
Moli" means "orange" in Fijian
Hey, look at this

Just a second!
I don't eat pork at all
She's going to be happy
I'm already inside
We'd only bother them
We'd only disturb them
We'd only be bothering them
We'd only be disturbing them
Nan's front gate is open
Granny's front gate is open
Mary's better than all of us
Does she live round here?
Does he live round here?
Do they live round here?
At night, a strong wind blew
She was at the doctor's
Have you had tea?
Have you had your tea?
We've just finished
He's good at football
She's good at football
Yes, I'm sure of that
Now I'm alone
He's joking, right?
Do you like it here in Berlin?
Did everyone do the homework?
What are the odds of that?
I'm not renting them out
Tell me more, Don.
Fascinating, Don.
Lots of people carry torches.
No, I haven't yet.
What if Tom finds them?
Describe it to me, Sam.
It sounds great, Sam.
Tom isn't your servant
Tom is the host, not a guest
Don't give it to Tom
He doesn't deserve that
That's how the story ended
It's an inflammation
I'll prescribe you antibiotics
It's an inflammation
Who has a question?
Does anyone have a question?
Which grave is Tom's?
Where does Tom rest?
Does anyone have a flashlight?
Where are you, admins?
Aye aye, sir
They say she's a good doctor
Does anyone have a torch?
Tom's in the garden right now
Tom's in the garden now
Yeah!
Delicious, Benedito!
Right.
Did Tom move back to Boston?
Tom's gotten so big
Tom's gotten so tall
Who's the goalie?
That's not incredible
It wasn't enough for Tom
Tom's older son is a policeman
Don't dare to marry Tom!
There are other choices?
What's Tom doing here?
We didn't even invite him!
Where did Tom leave it for me?
Everything's political
Nobody's at fault for this
Do you drink coffee or tea?
Someone's been here
Do you need all this?
Do you need all of this?
Tom doesn't cooperate enough
Tom's actions aren't my fault
We're dying of ennui
Let's talk about it now!
How did Tom insult you?
Tom's a lumberjack
What bothers Tom?
Does Tom know what love is?
Is she OK?
Don't touch me there
Who do you say called me?
Hello.
Hello, who am I speaking with?
Does Mary work here?
What about you?
What you do doesn't bother me
You've never been kind to me
The snow doesn't stop
It didn't stop snowing
We're all a bit eccentric
Don’t be a glutton!
That's a basketball
He's peeling her an apple
Merry Christmas to all!
The rutabaga is delicious!
I’m an American patriot
She’s a proud lesbian
It could've gone differently
David, I don't know.
What does it mean, David?
It's about 'cuteness.'
Give me an example, David.
Anybody got a better idea?
He's a cultured man
He's used to manual work
He's a creative thinker
I'm a highly complex man
Mary's son was born yesterday
Why did it happen to Tom?
Spanish sounds beautiful, too
Goodnight, Tatoeba
Good night, Tatoeba
Good night, Tom.
Good night, Mary.
Just right!
I can't be bothered
I'm scared
Where can I learn Korean?
Who did Tom attack?
Are you a university student?
Or do you work?
She's outrageously funny
He's disarmingly frank
You're not welcome here
What is this key for?
Do you want a cup of tea?
Life is a challenge, meet it!
Don't go away
You're welcome here
I don't accept the invitation!
You're a useless husband
Actually, I'm a furry
We'll wait till the evening
Good night, Tom.
Good night, Mary.
Good night, Tom
Good night, Mary.
Good night, Alice.
Good night.
Will you interpret for Tom?
You're entirely right
What shoes does he like?
Can we speak in English?
English isn't my mother tongue
You're a useless man
It's a two-person job
It's a one-person job
Who has let Tom do it?
They should shut up!
You'll have to believe me
Why did she want to meet him?
The cat doesn't stop meowing
European plugs don't work here
Where will I be?
Tom's dead, isn't he?
This church is not that big.
Since it's a baptistery.
This highrise is high.
We've run out of cheese
That's a neat look
Tom?
Are there any good news?
What a big Christmas tree!
I don't actually own a fursuit
We aren't free
I don't like this hat
We're saved!
It's improving
Let's buy him one
Hurry up, Mom
Did you have rice?
You're so pretty!
Make up your mind!
Is there any rice left?
I'm urinating
How much will we pay?
Let's do it together
Will you share it?
I'm starting
I'll start soon
I'll eat lunch soon
I'm finishing up
She's a teacher
Is he crying?
They'll put her in jail
I'll be sad
We'll recover
I'm an administrator
We'll overcome it
They're calling me
It's burning!
I'll be back really soon
They're coming really soon
Don't insist
They're slow
She's ready
There'll be plenty
He hasn't won an election
I'm on call at work today
Who gave the order to do it?
I'm on call in the hospital
Did you know he called us?
I'll refuse
Everything isn't yours
I don't know if it's worth it
It didn't really help
I don't want them to come here
Blockhead!
You're so handsome!
I love you.
I... love you, too.
I mean it!
Don't waste time on Tom
My team is the best!
My crew is the best!
My friends are the best!
We don't have your size
Take it away, guys!
It's OK to be wrong
It's okay to be wrong
And what about feminism?
What is your opinion on this?
You didn't pay on time!
I love blueberries!
What irritated Tom so much?
Who ate Tom's lunch?
Let's wait what Tom will say
These trousers are Tom's
How long was Tom ill?
There are 18 packets in a box
Mary is 2 metres ahead of Tom
John is 5 metres behind Alice
Tom is 3 metres behind Alice
It's dusty
I'll give a speech tomorrow
How can I improve my Berber?
I know you don't know Berber
What do you suggest?
Want to do a shot?
No, thanks
I'm on medication.
I don't like flip-flops at all
What are viruses?
Why do viruses exist?
Why does anything exist?
The remote's battery is dead
I don't want a beer right now
Where is the girl now?
I don't believe in copyright
I'm satisfied with the result
You don't even have money
The car's broken down
The box is blue, isn’t it?
When he came in, he sat down
I'm in my forties
Tell it to him!
Just tell it to him!
Your cousin Pete to Sydney?
I am glad that I wasn't here
Do you want to buy a flat?
You're being too strict
John is Tom's father
Unexpectedly, he was on time
I said I'd do it, didn't I?
Run out to get me the paper!
Since when are you my boss?
Run and get me the paper!
Since when are you my boss?
Tom couldn't calm down
This wasn't going to be easy
She's the only woman I want
It's far-fetched!
I don't know my way around
It's tough to forget him
He didn't speak a single word
I'm mediocre at tennis
I'm as strong as a bear
I'm as strong as an ox
I think that's Esperanto
I'm as strong as Samson
How farest thou?
I'm still a beginner at French
I'm still a beginner
I don't need him any longer
I don't have time tomorrow
I guess she won't come today
His number isn't reachable
Continue!
Well, go on!
It's not a prank
It isn't a prank
Are we gay?
I'm only lying down
It's quite roomy
It's a matter of record
It's marriage
It's not a state of bliss
I, too, am often angry
Did you bring wine?
Can you solve it?
I've painted all my life
I've painted my whole life
Do you know how to write it?
We have thirty-two teeth
Don't breathe
I'm sorry for doing it
He who knows, knows
I don't feel like it at all
You didn't ask him anything
I'm going to miss the test
I'll put in two garlic heads
Do you see the elephant too?
I don't want to buy anything
I'm just looking around
Did you know before?
I wasn't in love with anyone
They can't be together
It's too hot in the summer
You haven't told us anything
Sami didn't have a toothbrush
You're so funny I could die
How do I improve my Berber?
How to master Berber?
How can I master Berber?
I'll help Yanni learn Berber
How often have you tried?
Do you know Hungarian?
Do you know Arabic?
Do you know German?
Do you know Chinese?
Do you know Esperanto?
How did Tom threaten you?
Happier New Year!
Where's Tom?
He is walking the dog.
This is Tom's medical opinion
How much does that beer cost?
They didn't want to leave Tom
Don't be afraid to correct Tom
Honor and glory to the USSR!
Is your nose running?
Have you had trouble sleeping?
Do you have a sore throat?
Do you have trouble breathing?
Do you need to cough often?
Do you have to cough often?
Have you been sweating a lot?
Does your tooth hurt?
Do you feel light-headed?
I feel light-headed
I can't swallow properly
Do you have a dry mouth?
Are they there?
Are they in?
What are the club rules?
Can an elephant sneeze?
What will they do without me?
Where are my bags?
I'm Marika, his ex-wife
They're not my family
It's time for it to end
Yanni's life is over
The street's crowded
It's an awful hassle
We're not away to stay away
Don't be two-faced with me!
He's a very friendly young man
That one over the bed?
This world sucks..
Friendship sucks..
You're running fast
Climb the mast!
I'll call you at around 5
Why are kittens soft?
She's an irresponsible person
Oh, if only I were a queen
Tom's ignorance is telling
I'm happy you came
This bottle's cap won't close
I don't like that guy
I don't like that guy
Can't you take a joke?
The person didn't come
A gross is 144 units
I didn't intend to be mean
Why is Tom so happy?
Because of you.
Don't pick that up
It's dirty
She insisted, but I refused
I miss you so much, Dad
Tom, are you really a furry?
Why are you making that face?
I didn't see Tom do it
Let's do this quietly
We didn't have a good plan
Why did Tom park there?
I'm sorry
I didn't intend to be mean
I'm sorry
I didn't intend to do that
Tom promised he'd try again
Where's Tom located?
The light's on in his room
There's a lot of food
Don't give the award to Tom
He doesn't deserve it
What's Tom doing here?
I didn't invite him
That's why we fired Tom
I'm a man
Isn't it obvious?
Don't sit with Tom, OK?
Let's get Tom to do it
Well, I won't pay that much
Pardon me?
What is this button for?
What's this button for?
Yanni's school
Yanni can't teach Berber
I'm off to school
He who knows, rules
I'm craving dessert
There are 26 pupils in a class
What is the universe?
What do they really want?
What a very smart child!
She's very small
How old is she?
In 1970 he travelled to London
Tom doesn't have to come here
Of course, you have a choice
He's a buzzkill, a killjoy
It'll be our turn soon enough
I'm not fluent in Cat
Of course, we'll blame them
Tom did this, not Mary
Did Tom shut the door?
Did Tom close the door?
For now, keep quiet
Let's ask Tom to do it
Why don't you ask for a raise?
Tom doesn't do it here
This is what we've come to
Are you happy now?
We'd better tell Tom about it
Of course, it didn't work out
There's nowhere for you to run
Tom said he'll do this
I don't own a gun
I've lost faith in my doctor
I'm loving Tom's enthusiasm
Why did you teach Tom French?
They're buddies from school
That's our plan at this time
Of course, it's nonsense
What are you into right now?
What do you want?
I want to learn Berber.
I want to learn Berber.
What did you say?
You heard me.
Look Mom!
I got an A in math!
Does Tom plan to do it?
Yanni's life was in danger
Where's Yanni?
He's in Algiers.
Let's go find him.
Does Tom do this often?
It's too late now to do that
Words matter!
That's what we should do
Let's not sit with Tom
I'll help you later
You're five years old
Tom's a monster
By all means, let's be careful
He's a true monster
I'm Mary, Tom's sister
You are a monster!
You became a monster!
Does Tom need to do it?
If you want it, keep it
Tom has his father's blue eyes
I never said Tom's didn't help
The beach wasn't very crowded
I promised we'd help
I'm Tom, Mary's father
You aren't a monster
Did you eat?
I've seen Tom doing it
You're not a monster
At this point, we don't know
Where did you and Tom meet?
I see Tom's point
I hope I didn't make you wait
I've radioed for help
How do you plan to rescue Tom?
Why do you hate yourself?
Do you need a gun?
Won't you give me the floor?
They don't understand Nahuatl
Things didn't turn out so well
Why do cats sleep so much?
They're Romanian, aren't they?
On paper, your plan looks good
He'll have to work every day
That's the exciting part
How can I help him?
Did they write to them?
Why are we studying it?
I don't think much of it
How can we trust Tom?
We can't have everything
I'll try and help you
Where were you when Tom died?
This nice weather won't last
Here's how the plan would work
That's enough!
Doesn't Tom ever do it?
I'm happy Tom did this
Tom can't do this well
For the most part, that's true
It's avoidable
That's why I fired Tom
One day we'll laugh about this
You've got to have a plan
Is there some way I can help?
They don't wear shoes
Who sat with Tom?
There's no sign of foul play
It's hard for people to change
We'll keep on doing this
Is there any money left?
Is there any food left?
Let's rent bicycles
Let's rent a rowboat
Let's rent some roller skates
Mary wasn't worried
Tom, did you catch the flu?
Are you alright?
Nah, I'm fine
Thanks.
Aren't you guys homeless?
We couldn't find the tunnel
Am I not invited?
Isn't anyone interested?
Is sugar good for you?
Can Tom sit in the back?
Didn't you give Tom the book?
Of course, it's different now
Isn't it important to listen?
Will we do it if Tom leaves?
Did Tom turn blue?
Could you sit with Tom?
Ah, gotcha!
Oh, I see!
How should Tom do this?
Tom said it he'd do it
I'd never sit with Tom
Tom's money didn't last long
We can't just leave Tom there
He's an average man
What are you doing here?
Just heading home, sir.
Where's home?
Algiers.
Please get out of the vehicle.
Is Tom unable to do it?
Now it's time to move on
I'm a beginner at Esperanto
We're all stocked up here
You didn't leave me
Tokyo is a hard-working city
I'm here to listen to you
The door's locked
I can't get in
He's young but experienced,
Tom said I'd find you here
We've had a few close calls
It didn't happen right away
It looks like we're on our own
She's an FBI agent
There'll be more left for us
How many days are in February?
I'm Tom, Mary's grandfather
Of course, it's important
Is Tom really doing it?
Is that enough to live on?
You were great, Tom.
You ain't seen shit yet.
Wait, let me put my glasses on
He's very irresponsible
Tom doesn't do it well
She's so boring
Don't invite her to the party
Don't be so aggressive
Tom didn't do it right
Please read pages 1 to 17
No more!
I don't drink cognac
She doesn't drink cognac
Tom doesn't drink cognac
What happened, happened
We should've set off earlier
How do I improve?
How do I get better?
Is Tom likely to do it?
We can't live this way anymore
That's the last thing we want
It's OK to keep doing that
Let's let Tom do what he wants
Let's not let Tom do that
You're annoying me, Tom
Where are all your promises?
You're making me mad
Can you eat natto?
Where did my homework go?
Tom doesn't do it much
We've got to find Tom now
That part wasn't funny at all
That's the one I want to buy
This quilt can't be washed
Of course, I knew about it
I'm Tom, Mary's brother
I'm Mary, Tom's daughter
Police don't suspect foul play
That's a high price to pay
Tom can't do it either
Well, I can live with that
You know who he is?
Tom wasn't ready to do it
I'll get into big trouble
We'll leave when Tom does
Did you hear what I told you?
It isn't an easy way to live
It's time to make a change
Don't translate word for word
Don't get me started!
There's no need to help Tom
It would've been mean to laugh
Ask Tom how he's doing
People don't speak like that
Why would Tom need help?
Are you drinking coffee?
Don't say that!
Please don't pull my ears
I wouldn't know how to begin
It's too late to help Tom now
Do elephants eat meat?
Is Tom afraid to do it?
You can't sit with Tom
The outcome wasn't even close
It's fun to play with others
We don't have a plan yet
That's not true at all.
I didn't know that existed
They're Serbian
Is she that important?
What is a pendulum?
He's my addiction
I need to go to the butcher's
What are you guys up to?
She's always on my mind
Humans have thirty-two teeth
Am I beautiful enough for you?
We don't need to do this
You've got to help me do this
I'm in love with your soul
Don't let your friends down
If you want it, buy it
Are you Peter's wife?
Where is my thermos flask?
Let's have Tom do this
At 7 pm, I have dinner at home
How did you actually do that?
It's a big deal for me
What is blood made up of?
Do tigers eat birds?
Tom's stomach feels funny
I didn't let Tom do it
Well, let me put it this way
Not for long, though
Tom's excuse is pretty thin
You don't need a visa
Tom didn't do it again
Tell Tom I won't do it
Of course, I stayed to help
I told Tom I'd do this
Why do dogs eat grass?
Tom says he's doing it
It's a perfect plan
Do you have any friends here?
Are these numbers accurate?
Can we do something for you?
Can we do anything for you?
Is dinner ready yet?
When will dinner be served?
It's getting dark quickly
How long did he walk?
It didn't eat
OK, let's see what we can do
Tom didn't let us down
Do those shoes fit you?
I don't read comic books
Tom's silly
Tom still hasn't returned home
Is Tom still not here?
Has Tom still not come back?
Please don't tell him anything
I'm new here
Is sugar bad for you?
I'll always miss you
I, too, often get angry
Do elephants sneeze?
Of course, it's possible
That's the reason I left
I've finished eating lunch
Do you want some more soup?
Who did you say called me?
Could you move these boxes?
I feel we're up to the task
Most adults have 32 teeth
Children have 20 baby teeth
If you're ready, let's go
Why does Tom sleep so much?
Can we take pictures here?
May we take pictures here?
What is catnip?
It's time to play some music
Tom didn't do it today
Do you like it here in Boston?
I'd never buy one of those
Do we really need to do this?
We're on the wrong path
Others seem interested, too
Shall I have Tom do it?
Did you wash clothes today?
Why are you late, Tom?
I was eating lunch.
That's Tom's own opinion
How did you find that?
I hope Tom won't do it
Oh, so that's how you do it
Let’s break the pattern
Tom's trial could last a week
Does Tom have to do it?
It's not a big deal to me
Here's my last question
Yanni didn't see Skura's knife
Yanni can't speak the truth
This doesn't seem real
It's a moot point now anyway
Of course, Tom knew about it
I don't recognize that
I didn't steal the book
Will Tom sit in the front?
I was here but you weren't
I'm single but you aren't
Holy smoke!
I'm an open book
I've been trying to help
I'm Mary, Tom's ex-wife
It's a trick of some sort
Tom didn't seem fazed at all
Do you like small talk?
We can't let it simply subside
That was the deal-breaker
Don't make Tom do this
You've got to keep working
Did she get the package?
I don't like domestic chores
People don't believe it
We didn't sit with Tom
Ack!
Huh?
How is that relevant here?
I'd like to learn German
I don't like boiled egg
Who gave you that task?
Tom hopes you'll do it
Sorry, but that is impossible
Tom doesn't need any more help
Why's Tom always so hungry?
How far away is that island?
He didn't send any message
One needs to give one's best
It's a secular country
We'll take the bus at two
Does he like studying?
It's very useful to have a car
Of course, I know who you are
He doesn't have many friends
Does Tom do this a lot?
The food didn't get wasted
We're still number one
He's arguing about details
I don't like big houses
Didn't Tom sit with Mary?
Can anyone help me with this?
Maybe Tom didn't hear me
Tom doesn't buy it
Tom can't do this here
What's there to eat?
I'm so hungry!
You're no saint, either
I'm glad to hear Tom is well
Tom doesn't know where we live
I'd love to sit with you
No one's actually like that
Yes, you may go to the cinema
Sorry, you can't
It's not allowed
That's just part of it
I'm sorry we can't help
That's a few too many
I'm dead inside
How did it turn out?
How did it work out?
There's a place for everything
Is there a ghost here?
I can't find my cell phone
Why won't they let me do that?
Let's give Tom a hand
Tomas owes Maria 300 dollars
It's all my own fault
Why would I want to sit there?
Are you sure it is yours?
Are you sure that is yours?
Don't cry in the street
Tom wore an ill-fitting shirt
Sleep well, my princess
Is she really coming?
Of course, you can look at it
It's unlikely Tom will find us
Tom isn't alone now
That is a good T-shirt
Should I change the sentence?
Don't let them do this to me
Tom could've done this
Tom didn't want to kill Maria
Will you like it?
I'm afraid to drink it
Is every time like the first?
Why don't you sit down
Did you forget your mask?
Is that island beautiful?
What will you cook today?
Someday we'll all meet again
Can I sit in the back?
Tom says he'll do this
This isn't a done deal
I think I'm going to throw up
You can't live in the past
Can you turn the light on?
I'm renting a room for a month
Yanni destroyed Skura's life
Can't you sit with Tom?
We're not going to Algiers
You're ruining my life!
You're pushing me!
Stop screaming at me!
You're pushing me!
I hate you!
I hate you more!
I wish I've never met you!
I hate you!
I hate you!
Do you know Kabylia?
Have you ever been to Kabylia?
I'm Tom, Mary's uncle
The last suggestion was Tom's
We don't want to change this
How does catnip work?
Is catnip a drug?
Does she want to eat lenses?
Who knows Akfadou?
It'll be hard to keep Tom here
Did they step on yours?
You should've made Tom leave
Don't ask me why, but it works
Does Tom want to do it?
Next time, I'll bring a hammer
I promised Tom that we'd help
I'd rather Tom do this
We don't need you here
Tom isn't eligible to do that
That doesn't help anything
I wouldn't work for Tom again
Of course, we don't want war
Why do you hate Japanese?
What did you buy me?
What did you get me?
What Tom did wasn't unexpected
It's my turn to help you
We didn't play well at all
I've had it up to here!
That's all such nonsense
Here's some good news!
That won't happen either
The ad is tear-jerking
I've been wanting to thank you
I can't help Tom do it
It's great to hear your voice
Tom doesn't have asthma
Is it still 1987?
Tom and I didn't do it
Well, that's kind of my point
May I order now?
I'm not allowed to tell anyone
Can you tell?
Can you tell what's happening?
Can you see what's happening?
Am I presentable?
Tom is always well-dressed
I won't make Tom do it
Why was the election so close?
You'd better plan for problems
Of course, it didn't happen
Why is Tom covered in mud?
Can you tell who that is?
Can you see who that is?
Who spoke with Tom?
Who was talking with Tom?
Who was that talking with Tom?
Who was that arguing with Tom?
It's a good day for a hike
I don't need that yet
Do you need this now?
Turn the light on, please
Will you turn the light on?
That's what Tom keeps saying
Tom, too, likes Mary
Of course, I'm concerned
The pay wasn't very good
I like my old car, too
I liked my old car, too
Have you met Tom's wife?
I don't read the newspapers
Something's wrong with my car
Where's the dinner?
It's in the oven.
This won't happen again?
What a joke!
I've just had a few drinks.
A few drinks?
What a joke!
You're as drunk as a skunk!
They're romantic friends
Yanni's mother died early
Tom hasn't yet done it
I'm sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you
It's not really much of a deal
I've been coughing all day
Some marriages don't last
I just don't want to
It's now Tom's turn to speak
Tom is quite funny, isn't he?
Does Tom still do this?
How do I look?
Great.
How do I look?
Perfect.
I'll tell your mother
I wonder how did you find it?
The teasing ones, they are bad
Maybe I'll need some help
He will bring them to us?
Tom has done this, too
Should I call the doctor?
Let's circle back
I'm Tom, Mary's ex-husband
I've come to ask a favor
I told Tom you'd do it
He's not afraid of death
She turned to me, smiling
I'm going to the hotel
I'm on holidays this week
No, I didn't receive it.
Tom didn't do it alone
I'd like to pay cash
How many people were sitting?
Let's help Tom do this
I'm working on the report now
Should we sit with Tom?
That's a valid question
That didn't happen tonight
I'll come with
He's not lazy
Look, let's just leave?
Will you sit with Tom?
Tom left, looking satisfied
OK, let me get this straight

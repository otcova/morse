Isn't that correct, Tom?
Is this your girlfriend?
Is that your girlfriend?
I've got to go meet Tom
I'm still a little busy
I'm not at all busy now
I'll follow your advice
I told you I'm not busy
I thought you'd be busy
I know Tom isn't hungry
I don't intend to do so
How've you been feeling?
How's Tom doing at work?
How're you this morning?
How was your conference?
How have you been doing?
How do you do that, Tom?
How do they communicate?
How did the fight start?
How are they doing this?
Haven't you done enough?
Have you eaten anything?
Have you been listening?
Have they said anything?
Has Tom transferred yet?
Does Tom have a license?
Do you want us to leave?
Do you want some dinner?
Do you remember my name?
Do you have the picture?
Do you have it with you?
Do we have an agreement?
Did you have to do that?
Did Tom have his dinner?
Could it be that simple?
Come in quickly, please
Can you help us tonight?
Can you do that, please?
Can you babysit my boys?
Aren't you a sweetheart?
Are you with the police?
Are you wearing perfume?
Are you in a fraternity?
Are you fully recovered?
Are you from the police?
Are you frightened, Tom?
Are you being sarcastic?
Are you a freshman, too?
Are these your children?
You've had your chance
You've had a good year
You've always hated me
You're three days late
You're not wanted here
You'll need this again
You'll be needing this
You were scared, right?
You need patience, Tom
You don't seem so busy
Yeah, isn't that great?
Wouldn't they be happy?
Would you do it for us?
Would that be possible?
Will you wash my shirt?
Why weren't they there?
Why were you in prison?
Why were you in my car?
Why were you in Boston?
Why was it in your car?
Why is Tom being fired?
Why is it so important?
Why haven't you called?
Why have you done this?
Why don't you go there?
Why don't we rest here?
Why aren't you working?
Why aren't you with me?
Why aren't you smiling?
Why aren't you married?
Why aren't you in jail?
Why aren't you helping?
Why aren't you dressed?
Why aren't they coming?
Why are you whispering?
Why are you interested?
Why are you in my room?
Why are you in a hurry?
Why are you a cop, Tom?
Who were you expecting?
Who was at the meeting?
Who did the decorating?
Who are your neighbors?
Who are you protecting?
Who are you describing?
Where's my grandfather?
Where were you sitting?
Where were you in 2003?
Where were they before?
Where do you live, Tom?
Where are your friends?
Where are they meeting?
Where are our children?
What've you been doing?
What's your story, Tom?
What's your son's name?
What's your point, Tom?
What's your major, Tom?
What's your hurry, Tom?
What's your dad's name?
What's that boy's name?

What's in the envelope?
What're you looking at?
What're you doing, Tom?
What're you discussing?
What were their orders?
What was your response?
What was your question?
What time's your shift?
What time's your class?
What is it you propose?
What have you done now?
What do you have there?
What did you do it for?
What did you do before?
What are your concerns?
What are you whittling?
What are you proposing?
What are you inferring?
What are Tom's options?
What are Tom's hobbies?
What are Tom's chances?
What are those numbers?
We've had our problems
We're on the same team
We're on the same side
We're here to meet Tom
We're all friends here
We'll soon be together
We'll meet in the park
We'll meet at my house
We'll know soon enough
We'll have so much fun
We'll discuss it later
We'll be ready in time
We need your help, Tom
We could've helped Tom
Wasn't Tom in his room?
Was Tom at the funeral?
Was that what Tom said?
Was that an invitation?
Was that a coincidence?
Was I really that busy?
Tom's not feeling well
Tom wasn't very hungry
Tom was my friend, too
Tom thinks we're crazy
Tom thinks it's stupid
Tom says he's not busy
Tom needed Mary's help
Tom loved Mary's ideas
Tom looks worried, too
Tom knows what's wrong
Tom knows we're coming
Tom knows it's useless
Tom isn't welcome here
Tom isn't so confident
Tom isn't my boyfriend
Tom isn't my assistant
Tom isn't ignoring you
Tom isn't here anymore
Tom isn't finished yet
Tom isn't bothering me
Tom isn't at the hotel
Tom isn't an alcoholic
Tom is my son's friend
Tom is my ex-boyfriend
Tom is a self-made man
Tom heard Mary's voice
Tom hates me, you know
Tom hasn't decided yet
Tom has a half-brother
Tom found Mary's diary
Tom doesn't have a dog
Tom didn't see anybody
Tom didn't meet anyone
Tom didn't kiss anyone
Tom didn't even flinch
Tom couldn't help Mary
Tom couldn't handle it
Tom couldn't find work
Tom can't leave us now
Tom can't help himself
Tom can't believe this
Tom and I've been busy
This wasn't your fault
This was on Tom's desk
This was in Tom's desk
This isn't your office
This isn't their fault
This isn't so much fun
This is your home, Tom
They'll be so grateful
These horses are Tom's
These are for you, Tom
That's funny, you know
That's very personal
That wasn't your fault
That wasn't Tom's idea
Thanks for coming, Tom
Someone's in the house
Shouldn't you be going?
My jacket's in the car
My car's in the garage
Maybe Tom wasn't wrong
Maybe Tom wasn't right
Lower your weapon, Tom
Let's pick up the pace
Knock it off, will you?
It's Tom's only chance
It's for you to choose
It's almost dinnertime
It wasn't that serious
It isn't your decision
Is Tom in the bathroom?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is this your equipment?
Is that your boyfriend?
Is that what you think?
Is that the truth, Tom?
I'm still kind of busy
I'm not busy right now
I'm not as fast as you
I'm no longer homeless
I'm just not very busy
I'm glad to be of help
How're you doing today?
How is this my problem?
How is that your fault?
How have you been, Tom?
How are you today, Tom?
How are you doing, Tom?
Hey, where've you been?
Hey, Tom, are you here?
Here's your drink, Tom
Have you seen anything?
Have you done anything?
Have you been watching?
Have you been sleeping?
Does Tom have ponytail?
Does it have to be Tom?
Do you want some water?
Do you have to do that?
Do you have the remote?
Do you have a restroom?
Do you have a favorite?
Do you have a daughter?
Do you believe in fate?
Do you agree with that?
Do we have enough time?
Dinner will be at 6:30
Did Tom eat his dinner?
Could you have done it?
Could you do that, Tom?
Could we do this later?
Could this be possible?
Could it have been Tom?
Clean yourself up, Tom
Can't you do something?
Can you do that for me?
Can we do it this week?
Aren't you the doorman?
Aren't you hungry, Tom?
Are you wearing makeup?
Are you Tom's daughter?
Are you satisfied, Tom?
Are you ready for more?
Are you listening, Tom?
Are you in the library?
Are you from Australia?
Are you doing anything?
Are you being punished?
Are you being followed?
Are you a psychologist?
Are we really that old?
Are these Tom's gloves?
Your timing's perfect
Your time's almost up
Your life's in danger
You're up early today
You're not that smart
You're not that crazy
You're in danger, Tom
You're in danger here
You'll need some help
You'd better be right
You'd better be ready
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be neat?
Wouldn't that be cool?
Will you come with me?
Why weren't you there?
Why were you with Tom?
Why were you in there?
Why were you arrested?
Why isn't Tom smiling?
Why isn't Tom in jail?
Why isn't Tom at home?
Why is Tom downstairs?
Why is Tom doing this?
Why is Tom doing that?
Why is this important?
Why is that important?
Why is that a problem?
Why aren't you inside?
Why aren't you asleep?
Why are you surprised?
Why are you so hungry?
Why are you in Boston?
Why are you here, Tom?
Why are you concerned?
Why are we whispering?
Why are they laughing?
Why are they fighting?
Who hasn't been there?
Who disagrees with us?
Who are Tom's friends?
Who are they fighting?
Wherever you say, Tom
Where's your son, Tom?
Where's your car, Tom?
Where were you hiding?
Where were you before?
Where was your father?
Where are your papers?
Where are you sitting?
Where are Tom's folks?
Where are they headed?
Where are my slippers?
Where are my children?
When was it purchased?
Whatever you say, Tom
What's your plan, Tom?
What's your last name, Tom?
What's Tom been doing?
What's on for tonight?
What's in your pocket?
What's in this drawer?
What's in this closet?
What's in the package?
What're you doing now?
What're we doing here?
What're they planning?
What were your duties?
What were we thinking?
What was your problem?
What was your mission?
What was Tom's secret?
What was Tom thinking?
What is your job, Tom?
What is your decision?
What is our situation?
What haven't you done?
What has Tom done now?
What does that matter?
What do they do there?
What did this Tom say?
What did they replace?
What are your reasons?
What are your hobbies?
What are you planning?
What are you offering?
What are you knitting?
What are those noises?
What are those called?
What are they exactly?
What are these things?
We've never needed it
We've met on occasion
We've met a few times
We've had it analyzed
We've had a complaint
We've got to warn Tom
We're ready to return
We're in need of help
We're almost finished
We're all agreed then
We'll need Tom's help
We'll need their help
We'll meet them there
We'll meet again, Tom
Watch your mouth, Tom
Was Tom wearing a hat?
Tom won't let you pay
Tom won't forgive you
Tom tried, but failed
Tom took Mary's place
Tom took Mary's money
Tom thinks we're dead
Tom thinks it's great
Tom thinks it's funny
Tom shouldn't be here
Tom shook Mary's hand
Tom says you're lying
Tom must've had a key
Tom must've escaped
Tom knows you're here
Tom knows that's true
Tom knows I'm waiting
Tom isn't your friend
Tom isn't very hungry
Tom isn't very bright
Tom isn't that strong
Tom isn't seeing Mary
Tom isn't really sure
Tom isn't here either
Tom isn't helping any
Tom isn't getting one
Tom isn't coming here
Tom isn't busy either
Tom isn't always busy
Tom isn't a communist
Tom is busy, isn't he?
Tom doesn't seem busy
Tom doesn't look busy
Tom doesn't eat a lot
Tom couldn't touch me
Tom couldn't stand it
Tom couldn't get that
Tom couldn't be nicer
Tom caught Mary's eye
Tom can't handle this
Tom can't be replaced
Tom can't afford that
Tom can't afford both
Tom can't accept that
This'll be our secret
This was Tom's choice
This letter's for you
This isn't your place
This isn't your house
This isn't your fight
This isn't your fault
This isn't my problem
They're ready for you
They'll love that one
These aren't for sale
That wasn't our fault
That wasn't my intent
That wasn't difficult
That was Tom's mother
Take us with you, Tom
So where're you going?
See you around, girls
Save your breath, Tom
Put that down, please
Now we're in business
My name's on the door
Maybe Tom wasn't busy
Leave this to me, Tom
Keep it together, Tom
Just do your best, OK?
It's your choice, Tom
It's Tom on the phone
It's on your schedule
It's my job, you know
It's Monday, you know
It's for the children
It wasn't my decision
It was you, wasn't it?
Isn't that your shirt?
Isn't that right, Tom?
Isn't that a surprise?
Is Tom an electrician?
Is this your homework?
Is this a coincidence?
Is that your knapsack?
Is that what happened?
Is that my toothbrush?
Is that a coincidence?
Is it serious, Doctor?
I'm not giving up yet
I'm not all that busy
I'm a pretty busy guy
I'm a little bit busy
I suppose you're busy
I need your help, Tom
I know Tom isn't busy
How's your ulcer, Tom?
How're you doing, Tom?
How was your audition?
How long'll that take?
How is Tom these days?
How is that important?
How are they doing it?
Hold your tongue, Tom
Hold your horses, Tom
Hold your ground, Tom
Hey, how're you doing?
Here's your margarita
Here's to your future
Have you been injured?
Has Tom been released?
Has Tom been drinking?
Has Tom been arrested?
Had you been drinking?
Does Tom have a fever?
Do you play in a band?
Do you need some help?
Do you have your keys?

Do you have a picture?
Do you have a Kleenex?
Do you have a freezer?
Do you have a brother?
Do you agree with Tom?
Did you have a lawyer?
Did Tom listen to you?
Did they say anything?
Dance with me, please
Could Tom be involved?
Come with me, quickly
Can't you do anything?
Can it be that simple?
Can I give you a hand?
Are you Tom's brother?
Are you ready for bed?
Are you from the bank?
Are you dreading this?
Are you busy now, Tom?
Are you being coerced?
Are you and Tom close?
Are we ready for this?
Are those my slippers?
Are they done already?
Are these Tom's shoes?
Are these Tom's notes?
You're so good at it
You're single, right?
You're not one of us
You're all they have
You're a nice person
You're a good singer
You're a good doctor
You could've written
You could've said no
You could've knocked
Would you stand, Tom?
Why were you yelling?
Why were they chosen?
Why wasn't Tom there?
Why was Tom in there?
Why was Tom arrested?
Why isn't Tom asleep?
Why does Tom do that?
Why does this happen?
Why do you need this?
Why do you have this?
Why do you have that?
Why did you pick Tom?
Why did you hesitate?
Why did they do that?
Why aren't you there?
Why aren't you ready?
Why aren't they here?
Why aren't they back?
Why are you sweating?
Why are you stopping?
Why are you standing?
Why are they leaving?
Who were you calling?
Who was on the phone?
Who said that to you?
Who are your friends?
Who are your enemies?
Who are they sending?
Which way did Tom go?
Which did you choose?
Where's your luggage?
Where were you today?
Where were they sent?
Where was Tom hiding?
Where did you put it?
Where are we heading?
Where are we exactly?
Where are Tom's keys?
When did you do that?
When are they coming?
What's your solution?
What's your response?
What's your nickname?
What's their purpose?
What's the plan, Tom?
What's on your plate?
What's on the agenda?
What's in the coffee?
What's in the bottle?
What's in the basket?
What're you doing up?
What're you counting?
What were you saying?
What were they doing?
What were they after?
What was your motive?
What was Tom's crime?
What was Tom wearing?
What was Tom driving?
What was the message?
What was in the oven?
What is your mission?
What have they found?
What does that prove?
What do they do here?
What did we do wrong?
What did Tom do then?
What did Tom do here?
What did they expect?
What are you washing?
What are you holding?
What are you getting?
What are you feeling?
What are you drawing?
What are they saying?
What are they hiding?
What are their names?
What are our options?
What are our chances?
Were you in the army?
Well, you were wrong
Well, you were right
Well, you have to go
Well, are you coming?
We're ready for them
We're not that close
We're in third place
We're friends, right?
We're extremely busy
We'll meet you there
We'll meet Tom there
We'll meet Tom later
We needed Tom's help
Watch your step, Tom
Watch your back, Tom
Was Tom on your team?
Was Tom at the party?
Was it your favorite?
Tom's not a nice guy
Tom won't believe us
Tom won't believe it
Tom won't be in time
Tom wasn't very busy
Tom thinks I'm right
Tom still isn't sure
Tom says he's hungry
Tom knows we're here
Tom isn't your enemy
Tom isn't that young
Tom isn't that crazy
Tom isn't so certain
Tom isn't saying why
Tom isn't really old
Tom isn't my problem
Tom isn't my patient
Tom isn't my brother
Tom isn't lying down
Tom isn't in trouble
Tom isn't helping me
Tom isn't frightened
Tom isn't big enough
Tom hasn't called me
Tom hasn't been well
Tom didn't look busy
Tom couldn't make it
Tom couldn't keep up
Tom couldn't help us
Tom couldn't help it
Tom couldn't hack it
Tom couldn't do that
Tom could've refused
Tom can't believe it
Tom can't be missing
This was Tom's chair
This is Tom's school
This is serious, Tom
This is for you, Tom
They're on their way
They're on their own
They're best friends
They don't seem busy
These keys are Tom's
These aren't my keys
These aren't for you
That's all for today
That was Tom's fault
Thanks for this, Tom
Tell Tom he can't go
Stop doing that, Tom
Step in here, please
Someone's in my room
See you tomorrow, OK?
Put it on Tom's desk
My son's name is Tom
My car's been stolen
Maybe they're hungry
Listen to me, please
Let's go to the pool
It's quiet, you know
It's on the schedule
It's not Tom's fault
It's nice to be home
It's in the basement
It's hard to explain
It's funny, you know
It wasn't Tom's idea
It wasn't that heavy
It wasn't that funny
It wasn't on purpose
It isn't Tom's fault
It isn't that simple
Isn't that Tom's hat?
Isn't that Tom's dog?
Isn't that the truth?
Is Tom a businessman?
Is that an objection?
Is that a confession?
Is that a compliment?
I've never needed it
I've just had dinner
I'm not busy anymore
I'm glad to be alive
I'm extremely hungry
I'm already confused
I said I wasn't busy
I knew you'd be busy
How've you been, Tom?
How's your wife, Tom?
How's it coming, Tom?
How were they killed?
How was your evening?
How is this my fault?
How is that relevant?
How does Tom do that?
How does that happen?
Hi, how're you doing?
Have you googled Tom?
Have you been eating?
Has Tom been sedated?
Has Tom been injured?
Give us a minute, OK?
Does Tom have a reason?
Does Tom have a plan?
Does Tom have a boat?
Does Tom do it right?
Does Tom do anything?
Do you want some tea?
Do you meditate, Tom?
Do you have to leave?

Do you have anything?
Do you have a second?
Do you have a permit?
Do you have a nickel?
Do you have a garage?
Do you do this often?
Do you do that often?
Do we have insurance?
Do they have weapons?
Did you pick one yet?
Did you do your best?
Could you leave, Tom?
Come with us, please
Close your eyes, Tom
Catch you later, Tom
Can't we do anything?
Can you do it for me?
Can we do this later?
Can I buy you a beer?
Aren't you in charge?
Are you working hard?
Are you with us, Tom?
Are you with the FBI?
Are you unhappy, Tom?
Are you Tom's lawyer?
Are you Tom's friend?
Are you their mother?
Are you still hungry?
Are you staying, Tom?
Are you retired, Tom?
Are you on something?
Are you in the lobby?
Are you in the house?
Are you a vegetarian?
Are those my glasses?
Anybody have a match?
You're not that old
You were right, too
You were right, Tom
You must've known
You hate Tom, right?
Would you elaborate?
Why isn't Tom happy?
Why is that special?
Why is it important?
Why is it dangerous?
Why do you hesitate?
Why do they do that?
Why did you pick me?
Why did we say that?
Why did Tom do that?
Why aren't you home?
Why aren't you here?
Why are you worried?
Why are you staring?
Why are you so sure?
Why are you so busy?
Why are you in town?
Why are you dressed?
Why are you calling?
Why are we stopping?
Why are we fighting?
Why are they afraid?
Who would wear that?
Who were those guys?
Who was Tom meeting?
Who was in your car?
Who picked the corn?
Who is your brother?
Who are you kidding?
Who are they really?
Which of you did it?
Which do you prefer?
Where are you taking me?
Where was Tom going?
Where was Tom found?
Where have you gone?
Where does Tom live?
Where did you study?
Where did you do it?
Where are your kids?
Where are you today?
Where are we headed?
Where are our coats?
When will you start?
When were you there?
When were you fired?
When is your flight?
When does Tom leave?
When did they leave?
What's with the hat?
What's Tom planning?
What's Tom done now?
What's this exactly?
What's ours is ours
What's mine's yours
What's in your hand?
What's in the truck?
What's in it for us?
What's in it for me?
What's in here, Tom?
What're you hunting?
What was your score?
What was Tom saying?
What was Tom called?
What was that about?
What was in the box?
What stinks in here?
What is your choice?
What is our problem?
What is its purpose?
What is it you need?
What is it now, Tom?
What have you taken?
What have you found?
What have they done?
What does Tom think?
What does Tom teach?
What does that cost?
What does it matter?
What do you propose?
What do you do here?
What do you believe?
What do we do first?
What did they think?
What did they offer?
What are your terms?
What are your plans?
What are your names?
What are you making?
What are you having?
What are our orders?
What are my options?
We've met only once
We're really hungry
We're ready for you
We'll be behind you
We'd better go, Tom
We could've escaped
We believe you, Tom
Watch it there, Tom
Wasn't Tom with you?
Was the door closed?
Was it that obvious?
Was it an explosion?
Wait your turn, Tom
Wait in the car, OK?
Turn it off, please
Tom's now in a coma
Tom's not ready yet
Tom's eyes are open
Tom's eyes are huge
Tom's eyes are blue
Tom wears bi-focals
Tom wasn't that bad
Tom wasn't in on it
Tom says he's dying
Tom said you'd know
Tom said you'd come
Tom knows what's up
Tom knows it's true
Tom knows it's over
Tom knows I'm right
Tom isn't very nice
Tom isn't very busy
Tom isn't the enemy
Tom isn't that dumb
Tom isn't my friend
Tom isn't my father
Tom isn't my client
Tom isn't like them
Tom isn't like that
Tom isn't like Mary
Tom isn't in danger
Tom isn't giving up
Tom isn't even here
Tom isn't a suspect
Tom is good-looking
Tom can't stand you
Tom can't leave now
Tom can't help that
Tom can't help Mary
Tom can't find them
Tom can't deny this
Tom can't deny that
This wasn't my idea
This isn't your job
This isn't my fault
This isn't much fun
This is Tom's knife
This is Tom's grave
They're old friends
They weren't hungry
There wasn't enough
That's why I'm busy
That wasn't my idea
That answer's wrong
Take your time, Tom
Take your shot, Tom
Stay with them, Tom
So where did Tom go?
So what did Tom see?
So what did Tom say?
Send Tom in, please
See you around, Tom
Put it on Tom's tab
Open your eyes, Tom
Maybe it wasn't Tom
Make your move, Tom
Make it snappy, Tom
Look at Tom's shoes
Let's do this later
Keep it simple, Tom
It's your call, Tom
It's in your pocket
It's in the cabinet
It's in my backpack
It's hard, you know
It's from the Bible
It's been completed
It wasn't that loud
It wasn't that good
It wasn't our fault
It hasn't been easy
Isn't that exciting?
Is Tom with you now?
Is this your office?
Is this your locker?
Is that your excuse?
Is that the problem?
Is that OK with you?
Is that a complaint?
Is everybody hungry?
I've had a bad week
I'm terribly hungry
I'm really not busy

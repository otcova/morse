I've never seen her laugh
What an elegant yacht!
Don't ever touch me again
I don't want you to lie to me
Let's fall in love
Mary, are you in there?
Are you angry at me?
You bet I am!
Tom, you're such a big meanie
You're ugly.
Your mom is ugly.
Your mom's face is ugly.
You're ill, aren't you?
I'm happy I could help
It just doesn't look right
It doesn't look right
I haven't done this in ages
He's Canadian
Why didn't you tell me?
You never asked.
Do you have a 401(k)?
Do you have a retirement plan?
There won't be an alternative
I love him..
Are we already leaving?
I'll try to get a little sleep
Does Tom like Maria?
How can one live without pork?
I'm also going to school
That's greed
Are you going to school?
I'm a student
And you?
Google doesn't know everything
I don't like her anymore
We're finally alone
It's time to go up
Don't skip classes, okay?
What did you try to do?
I would've said yes
I would've said no
Don't mind the money at all
And if she is wrong?
What is a religious sect?
Mario, stop calling me gay!
I'm straight!
How are you?
I'm great, and you?
I'm great also, thanks!
May I have your email, please?
Do you have a nickname?
Yes, it's Rick.
Do you have a nickname?
How did you get your nickname?
Who gave you your nickname?
He didn't notice me
She didn't notice me
Is Robin Hood alive?
How do you say XXX in English?
Is my Italian so bad?
Is my French really that bad?
How old were these kids?
After a while, Tom joined him
After a while, Tom joined her
Are we eating out tonight?
Did she send you?
Did he send you?
It's an ongoing process
You think?
Come on, Tom
It'll be fun
Tom is a world-class athlete
Your dad is really cool.
Not really.
I've never seen her this angry
Could you give me a ride?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
He's angry at his child
I don't like what she has done
I don't see suds
There's no suds
Are you widowed?
Sometimes, life is so unjust
Sometimes, life is so unfair
Where is this place?
Do you know where the zoo is?
Tell it to the marines!
She's capable of anything
He's capable of anything
Let's take a pause
When is it going to happen?
Shall we drink something?
Show me the way, please
Can anyone confirm your story?
Let's jump into the water
Do you have WhatsApp?
At least it's only two floors!
That's probably going to fall
Who allowed her in?
All right everyone, listen up
I've got bills to pay
Where is my comb?
Where's the phone book?
I didn't eat the hamburger
Is it here that the bus stops?
Does the bus stop here?
You don't understand anything!
I don't even pretend to.
Why don't you rely more on us?
What's the matter, darling?
He finally arrived!
Snow year, corn year
What are you cooking today?
I'm the one who has the key
She's the woman I desire
It's possible, right?
Any drugs or weapons?
She was good-hearted
I was self-confident
I don't like your dad
It was very mild!
He wasn't worthy of suspicion
He didn't seem suspicious
Once, it was the stone age
I missed this deadline again!
She's in Boston
I am blonde, of course
I'm washing my hands
Are you a good cook?
Come and see!
The ampersand means "and
It's both raining and blowing
Take it and go!
When does it close?
How's the weather in Iran?
Do you want to learn Persian?
Have you ever been to Tehran?
I wasn't sure about that
Wait, there's more
And that's when she kissed him
And that's when he kissed her
What happened?
He can't treat me like that
You can't treat me like that
This is my fault.
No, it isn't.
Seriously, I’m not lying
I can't fix it
It'll have to be replaced
She doesn't read anything
She won't come today
I think I've mixed them up
Sometimes it can't be avoided
It was really creepy!
They should go to hell!
Are there no cakes left?
I ate them both.
That's an interesting study
Why didn't you go first?
What is the voltage?
The door doesn't lock
He doesn't ask people to pose
That's how we do it in French
Do not say "wait
It's a miracle!
The link works!
I don't see anything there
I'm going to give you the book
I'll give you the book
Don't trust anyone here!
What do you want the most now?
Money.
Tom isn't here any more
Do you like your work?
Stop being a nuisance!
I call myself “Tom”
I'm Tom's guardian
I am Tom's custodian
We're slowly nearing the end
I just lay around on the sofa!
Do you know Persian?
I didn't read
What's that?
How am I supposed to know?
Tom will be here till 2:30
I'll be there at 2:30
See you tomorrow at 2:30
Tom came about 2:30
Tom will be here by 2:30
I have to be back by 2:30
Tom died on October 20, 2013
I married Tom in 2013
Tom Jackson lived to be 93
This is my fiancé
Can you stay till 2:30?
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
Let's go to the zoo
Did you cook this yourself?
Can I borrow yours?
Is this pen yours?
Is this all yours?
What's wrong with yours?
Can you lend me yours?
Is this umbrella yours?
Maybe you're too young
I'd hate to die young
Why did I ever marry you?
What else can I show you?
Who's going to hurt you?
Why would I hurt you?
How could we forget you?
Don't you know I respect you?
How does that affect you?
You're early, aren't you?
You're curious, aren't you?
Was it difficult for you?
Why would I do that for you?
Should I get Tom for you?
Is that enough for you?
Does my being here bother you?
Do you want Tom to help you?
Why not let Tom help you?
What's important to you?
What did they do to you?
Why shouldn't Tom talk to you?
Does this belong to you?
Is this confusing to you?
Why would we lie to you?
When have I ever lied to you?
You don't have a key, do you?
You don't like them, do you?
You don't understand, do you?
How does this concern you?
Did Tom lay a hand on you?
Did Tom ever threaten you?
Look after Tom, will you?
Turn off the TV, will you?
What did they ask you?
What did Tom ask you?
How can I ever thank you?
Why did they attack you?
Is that all right with you?
Do I have to go with you?
Why don't I go with you?
May I walk with you?
Didn't Tom come with you?
Was that man harassing you?
Was someone helping you?
Who's been watching you?
Would they recognize you?
How will I recognize you?
You haven't eaten, have you?
Did I invite you?
Did I surprise you?
Why would they hire you?
You weren't worried, were you?
Why would that scare you?
Exactly how old are you?
How can I convince you?
Oh, you noticed that, did you?
Did I really say I loved you?
Have I embarrassed you?
Who attacked you?
Of course, I'll marry you
I'd be lonely without you
Let's talk about you
I'm sorry I shot you
I wish I'd never met you
It won't be easy to forget you
It'll be hard to forget you
I'd love to meet you
I'm starting to doubt you
No one's looking at you
Tonight, I'll miss you
I've always wanted to kiss you
Tom isn't as talented as you
I couldn't wait for you
This fruit isn't for you
This stuff isn't for you
These flowers aren't for you
We don't have room for you
I'll try to find Tom for you
I'll cook for you
I'll be back for you
I'll cook something for you
I guess I'm too old for you
We'll look after you
Don't let anyone stop you
Sorry, I can't help you
Tom won't be able to help you
I told Tom that I'd help you
I'll have that sent to you
They say it's up to you
We've been trying to warn you
I'm keeping an eye on you
I've always believed in you
Tom hasn't forgotten you
I'm stronger than you
They'll try to kill you
I'm going to kill you
I'm here to kill you
I'll never tell you
We're all with you
I'll go anywhere with you
I won't go there with you
Wasn't Tom here with you?
I can't wait to hug you
I'll never stop loving you
I'm angry at you
Shut up, the both of you
Come here, the both of you
I'm tired of you
Of course, I forgive you
I'll never deceive you
Of course, we believe you
I'll come to save you
I don't want to hate you
Tom isn't here, I assure you
Don't let it trouble you
Look, I really like you
Not everyone's like you
I'm always happy to see you
I'd love to see you
It's so good to see you
I've finally found you
I still don't understand you
I'm sorry if I startled you
I've always liked you
Why aren't you ready yet?
Has Tom asked you out yet?
The results aren't out yet
Have you made a list yet?
Have you kissed Tom yet?
Why aren't you home yet?
I'm not sleepy yet
Even Tom doesn't know it yet
I haven't fixed that yet
We don't have the results yet
I haven't finished this yet
We don't know the answer yet
The holidays aren't over yet
We're not open yet
We haven't found Tom yet
I don't have enough yet
I haven't been shopping yet
We don't know anything yet
I haven't been there yet
I haven't seen that movie yet
We're not free yet
I'm not convinced yet
How was the party yesterday?
How was yesterday?
How was the meeting yesterday?
How was the picnic yesterday?
I didn't do much yesterday
Tom didn't eat lunch yesterday
Why did you say yes?
Where were you last year?
Tom's father died last year
I'll graduate this year
I'm getting married this year
Did you read what I wrote?
What did I say wrong?
Who was wrong?
Who said I was wrong?
What's wrong?
Who's wrong?
Was Tom wrong?
Are you saying I'm wrong?
Have you done something wrong?
I'm glad to see I was wrong
Well, I guess I'm wrong
I guess I'm wrong
I've been doing it all wrong
They're both wrong
You didn't say anything wrong
I'm not doing anything wrong
I don't see anything wrong
We can't find anything wrong
You've done something wrong
I've done something wrong
What've you written?
You're a great writer
Do you know what to write?
What's it worth?
It could've been worse
There's no need to be worried
Is that how it works?
It's not yet working
I'm glad that worked
How will it work?
Did the dishwasher work?
Where do you want to work?
How do you go to work?
When do you go to work?
Are you going back to work?
Is this really going to work?
Do you really have to work?
Where would you like to work?
What time do you get off work?
I've finished my work
This computer doesn't work
I can't go to work
I'm ready to get back to work
Do you know the right words?
Those were Tom's last words
I can't express it in words
I don't like that word
Tom didn't say another word
They didn't say a word
I'm still a little woozy
We don't know who won
Do you like women?
I still don't understand women
Who were you with?
What did you measure it with?
Who did you go there with?
What are they armed with?
Is that what you really wish?
What's your third wish?
That's not very wise
It'll be a long winter
There's no chance of winning
How about a little wine?
May I open the windows?
Do you think I might win?
Did we win?
Who should win?
Tom can't seem to ever win
I knew Tom wasn't going to win
Where did you meet your wife?
Don't you love your wife?
Would you explain why?
Do you mind if I ask why?
Do you have any idea why?
Let's ask ourselves why
Tom won't tell me why
Where's your whistle?
Why are you always whining?
Who saw what?
Your hair's not even wet
Where did you say Tom went?
Do they pay you well?
How deep is this well?
Did everyone sleep well?
Did everything go well?
Are you doing well?
Are you all doing well?
Do you think Tom did well?
Are you paid well?
Tom isn't very well
My books don't sell very well
Tom's doing very well
They've spent their money well
I'm sure you meant well
I can't write that well
I wasn't well
I don't think Tom is well
Tom didn't do it so well
Did the surgery go well?
You've chosen well
I'm not at all well
I think you're doing well
I'm not a weirdo
I'll be around for three weeks
Did you enjoy your weekend?
Was Tom in Boston last week?
Let's meet again next week
We'll be back here next week
Did you come to my wedding?
What do you usually wear?
What should we wear?
Do you feel the same way?
I wouldn't go that way
Let's try it this way
I'll find a way
Don't drink this water
Don't use too much water
What channel are you watching?
Tom didn't know what it was
Here's the recipe you wanted
Tom didn't know what he wanted
Tom couldn't do what he wanted
It wasn't what I wanted
What do you really want?
Is that what we really want?
What flavor do you want?
Do you know what I want?
What do you think I want?
I don't know what they want
I'll buy you anything you want
Where's your magic wand?
Has anyone found a wallet?
Tom couldn't see over the wall
Are we going to walk?
Can you still walk?
Did you have a nice walk?
I wouldn't have waited
Will we have to wait?
I know you can't wait
You know I can't wait
I'm sure you'll wait
It wasn't worth the wait
It's worth the wait
I'm definitely going to vote
Who wants to play volleyball?
I've always liked volleyball
Who asked for vodka?
It's not a virus
Have you seen this video?
Do you like venison?
Is it really so valuable?
Are you on vacation?
I'm officially on vacation
They're all on vacation
This isn't a vacation
Did you learn anything useful?
Where's the hammer you used?
Where's it used?
Do you think Tom saw us?
Do you worry about us?
Why don't you trust us?
Why did you interrupt us?
Are you still mad at us?
Who's going to do that for us?
How is that good for us?
Who can stop us?
Who would want to help us?
Has Tom promised to help us?
What good is that to us?
Why are they so mean to us?
Why'd they call us?
Why would they attack us?
What do they want with us?
Why can't you go with us?
Would you like to go with us?
Why are they attacking us?
How did you ever find us?
The rain didn't stop us
Tom won't be able to help us
Tom said that you'd help us
I really do wish you'd help us
You said you'd help us
Please don't lie to us
Tom couldn't go with us
Maybe you'd like to go with us
I'll take Tom along with us
Tom didn't come with us
Tom didn't agree with us
I don't think Tom believed us
Why are you still upset?
I know that Tom's upset
They're upset
Would you please shut up?
Why can't you pick me up?
Tom didn't even help Mary up
Here, let me help you up
Let's get up
I've just woken up
I'm just warming up
I definitely won't give up
It's time to wake up
The numbers don't add up
I think it's unnecessary
I'm really unlucky
It doesn't sound so unlikely
Don't be so unkind
You've made me very unhappy
What you've done is unethical
Why can't you understand?
I'll help you to understand
There's nothing to understand
It wasn't hard to understand
It's hard to understand
Of course, I understand
I'm still very undecided
Why did you take my umbrella?
This isn't my umbrella
Here's your umbrella
I didn't take your umbrella
You're very ugly
You aren't ugly
Did you really see a UFO?
Maybe I wasn't Tom's type
I'm not your type
I'm not saying this twice
I think it's my turn
Would you like to try?
I'm willing to try
It's useless to even try
Did Tom tell the truth?
Can Tom be trusted?
Would you open the trunk?
Was it true?
Do you think it's true?
Is it still true?
Are you sure it's all true?
Say it's not true
Say that's not true
What Tom told you isn't true
We hope it's all true
That's all true
What Tom says isn't quite true
It's unlikely to be true
I'm not a trucker
Did you call a tow truck?
We're waiting for a tow truck
Someone's in trouble
Do you play the trombone?
How was the trip?
I'm already tired
I've tried
Do you think it's a trap?
Are you taking the train?
I'll come by train
I've never traveled by train
I'm already on the train
I'll catch the 2:30 train
How long are you in town?
How long will you be in town?
By the way, Tom is in town
We'll see you back in town
Can you hand me a towel?
Did you enjoy your tour?
I know it'll be tough
It'll be tough
Don't change the topic
Do you have a toothache?
I've chipped a tooth
We don't know what Tom took
Did you know that, too?
Did you buy potatoes, too?
Did you win a ribbon, too?
I feel very hungry, too
I want to be happy, too
I feel very sleepy, too
I feel the same way, too
I'll go there on Monday, too
I hate Valentine's Day, too
I miss you, too
We have one for you, too
Tom can help you, too
We missed you, too
You can do it, too

I enjoyed it, too
You're right, too
I saw that, too
I love cats, too
I used to like Boston, too
I'm on vacation, too
My name is Tom, too
I kind of like Tom, too
Next time, I'm coming, too
I want to leave, too
Tom broke that promise, too
You were there, too
It's raining here, too
It bothers me, too
It happens to me, too
It happened to me, too
I feel very tired, too
This time, I'm scared, too
Tom was worried, too
Could I see you tonight?
What'll happen tonight?
Are you open tonight?
Who'll be there tonight?

It'll be very hot tomorrow
I'll do this tomorrow
You'll feel better tomorrow
I'm going to work tomorrow
I'll buy a backpack tomorrow
Are you really Tom?
What don't you like about Tom?
Why don't you just hit Tom?
Did you just hit Tom?
Are you still mad at Tom?
Why don't you just kiss Tom?
How did you guess I was Tom?
What've you been doing to Tom?
Who wrote to Tom?
Why did you poison Tom?
Don't you call him Tom?
Why shouldn't I tell Tom?
Don't you ever call Tom?
What did you ask Tom?
Do you want to go with Tom?
Don't you believe Tom?
Why don't you leave Tom?
Why don't you just fire Tom?
Why don't you call me Tom?
How can you not like Tom?
How did you convince Tom?
Who appointed Tom?
What was it you asked Tom?
Will you stay, Tom?
What's the matter now, Tom?
Is that enough for you, Tom?
How old are you, Tom?
What do you think of it, Tom?
What did you think of it, Tom?
Are you all right, Tom?
What are you smiling at, Tom?
Don't you think so, Tom?
What am I going to do, Tom?
What do you mean, Tom?
How do you feel, Tom?
What's wrong, Tom?
Are you coming, Tom?
What was that you said, Tom?
I'm not going to marry Tom
I'm being harassed by Tom
Don't lie about Tom
I'm sure we can trust Tom
I know that wasn't Tom
I didn't kiss Tom
That's not for Tom
I couldn't wait for Tom
I'll keep it for Tom
I'd never do that for Tom
That's for Tom
I've done what I can for Tom
Sleep's the best thing for Tom
Just don't vote for Tom
Please don't vote for Tom
I'm sorry I couldn't help Tom
I won't be able to help Tom
I promise you I'll help Tom
You said you'd help Tom
I'll mention it to Tom
We'll leave it to Tom
Don't give them to Tom
Don't lie to Tom
I'm married to Tom
I'll have to warn Tom
Don't count on Tom
Don't be too rough on Tom
Here's the letter from Tom
Here's a letter from Tom
Don't get angry with Tom
I'd never do that with Tom
I can't keep up with Tom
I'll try to keep up with Tom
I thought I'd go with Tom
I'll talk with Tom
I wonder what's wrong with Tom
I'm studying with Tom
I'm staying with Tom
I don't agree with Tom
I'm no longer afraid of Tom
I won't be able to promote Tom
Let's congratulate Tom
The truth is I don't like Tom
I hope I don't end up like Tom
I knew you'd like Tom
I'm on my way to see Tom
I wasn't allowed to see Tom
I wasn't permitted to see Tom
I'm sure I can persuade Tom
I'll help you find Tom
I can't understand Tom
We shouldn't have told Tom
Don't get angry, Tom
We know all this already, Tom
I've got it now, Tom
I won't forget you, Tom
I'll do that for you, Tom
I can't help you, Tom
I want to talk to you, Tom
I'm jealous of you, Tom

Come with me, Tom
You don't understand me, Tom
That was what you said, Tom
Here's your tea, Tom
Do you work together?

Who can I sell it to?
Where does this trail go to?
Where does this path go to?
Where's Tom moving to?
Where are you rushing off to?
Where did you move to?
Why have I been lied to?
Tom isn't easy to say no to
I'll do what I have to
Can you hand me a tissue?
I'm now very tired
I'm really, really tired
I don't feel at all tired
I'm sure you're tired
I guess I'm a little tired
What's our arrival time?
Do you still have time?
Do I look like I have time?
Is this not a good time?
Did I come at a bad time?
I'll explain it next time
We'll make it next time
It'll be better next time
Don't talk so much next time
I'll come back some other time
Yesterday, I had no time
I can't get ready in time
Tom didn't come in time
We don't have too much time
Don't waste too much time
I didn't lose much time
Tom must've slept a long time
We don't have any more time
We've lost valuable time
It's not a good time
Now's a bad time
We've sold all the tickets
Where's Tom's ticket?
How much is a ticket?
I'll pay for Tom's ticket
Tom didn't have a ticket
Have you thought this through?
Would you let me through?
I'm just passing through
Do you feel threatened?
Did you feel threatened?
What's wrong with those?
Do you like any of those?
I'll need several of those
Do you want to try this?
Can anyone verify this?
What do you mean by this?
Are you bothered by this?
How could you allow this?
What can I do about this?
Shouldn't we report this?
Why do you want this?
Why would I want this?
Have you looked at this?
Do you have room for this?
Where do we go after this?
What do we do after this?
Where did you hear this?
When did you do this?
Who asked you to do this?
Do we really have to do this?
Can anyone help me do this?
Why shouldn't I do this?
Does Tom know all this?
Are you all right with this?
What can I do with this?
Do we have to watch this?
Why are we discussing this?
Would you mind holding this?
Did you approve of this?
Can I use this?
Why did you get me this?
Are you always like this?
When did we decide this?
Have you tried this?
I know you'll enjoy this
I won't eat this
I'm trying to do this
It's important I do this
It's important that I do this
I don't deserve all this
We don't have to watch this
I'm not getting this
Look, I'm not doing this
You won't regret doing this
You'll regret doing this
You'll love this
I didn't write this
I know you'll appreciate this
I don't want to debate this
Look, I can handle this
You can't live like this
We can't continue like this
You can't die like this
I've never liked this
I knew you'd be thirsty
I'll ask Tom what he thinks
Tom asked me what I'm thinking
Is that what you really think?
Who cares what you think?
Tom, what do you think?
Who cares what I think?
What do you think I think?
You're exaggerating, I think
This is accurate, I think
I'd be happy here, I think
Don't touch my things
We don't like to rush things
Maybe I'm just hearing things
I'm used to these things
How can you say such a thing?
I won't touch a thing
I don't understand a thing
I didn't understand a thing
You haven't changed a thing
They're all thieves
Do you think I'm a thief?
How large were they?
What are they?
How large are they?
What's wrong with these?
Do you like any of these?
Do you like these?
Do I have to read these?
Are you still out there?
Who put it there?
Can you put this over there?
Do we really have to go there?
Are you all right in there?
What's hidden in there?
What did you find in there?
How long was I in there?
Why were you even there?
Do I have to go back there?
What are you doing there?
Is there something there?
How many cops are there?
Could you take me there?
What did you see there?
Has Tom promised to be there?
They're already there
I can't wait to get there
They're always there
Let's go back up there
I've decided to go there
Tom's always been there
We can't leave Tom there
I don't plan on being there

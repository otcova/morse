Why are you acting so strange?
It's not a badge of honor
Why can't I do anything right?
Tom would help us, I think
What time will you get back?
If I could, I'd do that again
I never bothered to do that
I don't like the climate here
I don't like doing that at all
Do you like playing baseball?
Changes are already under way
Mary must be Tom's girlfriend
Don't worry
You'll get credit
Can you do a cartwheel?
Where is the farmers' market?
How is it done?
Don't talk back
I don't have anything at all
We shouldn't press our luck
You shouldn't press your luck
You shouldn't push your luck
I think I've got frostbite
It's very humid today
What is the temperature there?
Which way to the monument?
Do you have any ice tongs?
Do you know the extension?
Do you have an extension?
Can we get a voucher?
We paid, in total, 800 euros
Who is he looking for?
Who did he call?
Tom!
What a nice surprise!
Tom acts as if he's the king
We're selling the house
Stop!
Don't come in!
Where is the next gas station?
Can I get a bag?
How do I get downtown?
When's the baby due?
I'll be there by Monday
She's quite gorgeous
Crying won't help
Stay out of my personal space!
What took you two so long?
Don't feel obligated
Have you ever fainted?
What causes people to faint?
What causes a person to faint?
Help!
Where did you come back from?
That's not the right word
Did you try the cake?
Do you enjoy traveling?
Do you enjoy old movies?
How do you like living here?
How do you like this school?
You'd better make up your mind
What's your mom's name?
There isn't any
It's unthinkable!
Do you like old movies?
Why do you like baseball?
Do you like playing cards?
What fruit do you like best?
When do you like to do that?
Why do you like this school?
Do you enjoy going on picnics?
Do you like to play badminton?
Can Tom play the trumpet?
How is life in Gaza?
Who's your favourite actor?
Is Tom already in Boston?
Are you already in Boston?
Are you on social media?
Are you still the manager now?
She's out of town
Seagulls, pelicans, seals
What else do you need?
There's no order here
I'm hard of hearing in one ear
You want me to close that?
You cleaned up tonight, buddy
Is your kitchen still open?
How's it goin' there, chief?
I've done that quite a bit
I don't know where Boston is
There's no reason to it
Sami's wife is Palestinian
To some, Israel is a democracy
If it doesn't exist, create it
Is this what you talked about?
When did you read them?
Did you respond to them?
What are your memories of Tom?
Tom's dad is cool
Tom's mom is cool
Tom stole Mary's lunch money
When did you read this book?
Where'd you learn to do that?
Well, I don't care!
That's his problem!
It's loose
It's just about to fall off
It's still drivable
Is this your lunch?
There's a spider in the box
Do you have laundry to do?
We're out of pickles
Can you buy some more pickles?
Those fish aren't fit to eat
What's the point here?
I wasn't feeling very hungry
I've bought a car
Tom has a black 'Stang
What about Tom?
What about him?
That's not my responsibility
That isn't my responsibility
No wonder Tom was mad
Tom's a bit of a fanatic
You're getting fat
Tom is a bit old fashioned
It's likely to rain
What did Tom say last night?
Why don't you call Tom again?
It's quite complicated
It's quite spectacular
You can't just let Tom do that
It's really impressive
It's really surprising
It's relatively simple
I can't get this to work
May I offer a suggestion?
Perhaps you've heard of me
You'd better wear a jacket
It's quizzical
Is there any benefit to it?
Where can I buy butter?
Where can I buy gloves?
Where can I buy a lawnmower?
Don't watch the movie first
Where can I buy a hammer?
What are you throwing at me?
Where can I buy cumin?
Where can I buy anchovies?
I'd like to buy some apricots
Tom's horse bit him
Blue isn't my favorite color
I'll add it to my collection
Tom's dog bit him
Tom's mother spanked him
Tom's mother yelled at him
That's not the correct answer
That isn't the correct answer
What's your preference?
I'm going straight to Mexico
I'm good at them
Don't eat that dirty olive
It is so much fun!
It's right up your geek alley
Do you want to do another one?
It's the same life experience
Have you seen the movie?
Have you tried the Batman one?
I'm going to explode
I'm having flashbacks
So it's nice
Keoko, sit!
But that's what I'm saying
We're out of towels
I didn't do anything all day
What an ugly dog!
There's a hole in your shirt
Do you like my pickup truck?
There's an error here
They'll let us know
It's not his
It wasn't his to give
Can you get more figs?
Can you chip in?
I'm a peanut butter vacuum
Do you want another one?
It was Tom's own fault
You'd better buy that book
Thank God, the storm is over
Is your momma a piranha?
I expected to be home by 2:30
What's that horrible sound?
Isn't it too late to do that?
Tom's belly is growing
What time is the show?
I'm too full to move
Where is your letter?
Don't tell me now
What did Mary say?
Why didn't Mary go?
I'm puzzled by your reaction
We don't have fruit
We used to.
What is your new address?
She said, "Just thanks.
Why are you turning red?
It's not even connecting
I can't go home until 2:30
What's your new address?
I can't stand staying indoors
It's addicting
What was your final score?
It smells like popcorn.
You're right!
I'm a bad-ass
You are so full of crap!
You'll have to move
Go!
Where to?
Tuesday evening!
I was day-dreaming.
No, sir; you are mistaken.
Dear me!
Why, I could have sworn to it
It's this way, Watson
What's this, Dawson!" he cried
No gossiping!
Go about your business!
Oh, come in if you wish to.
You have got him!
Where is he, then?
He is here.
Here!
Where?
Where can we talk privately?
I'll keep you safe
“Most preposterous!”
“What is this, Holmes?”
No, I cannot.
Then I will tell you.
You shall have it then.
“Yes, you are quite right
“Ha!
It is the answer!”
“Have you found out anything?”
“I have found out everything!”
You are joking.
Come on, Watson
‘Where’s Mary?’
‘Don’t, Jim, don’t!’ says she
Don't, Tom, don't!
‘Why not?’ says she
‘Because I order it.’
But what end?
She's British
She's English
He's British
Save the theatrics, Tom
Cut the purple prose, Tom
I don't really care
Do you?
Did you end up volunteering?
Did you end up doing that?
Where did you end up eating?
Where did you end up staying?
Where did you end up going?
How were you caught?
Let's talk first thing Monday
There's another solution
Where do you call home?
What are you hauling?
Let's clear the table
What were you there for?
What's the tally?
Tom is doing that, too
Is Tom doing that now?
I'm still a little disoriented
Have you found out anything?
Can you tell me where I am?
Why didn't Tom go?
There's someone in the hall
There's somebody in the hall
Is that true?
Be careful!
Why are you soaking wet?
Can I take a peek?
We've reached the peak
Can I have a kiss and peck?
Six pages in, I lost interest
Really, Tom, really?
We've been exposed
I am thrilled!
What does the majority think?
Can I throw this out?
There are 214 Kangxi radicals
Get off your soapbox, Tom
Big car, little dick
I've just waxed the floor
Tom's silence made Mary angry
Please don't be angry with me
Tom isn't as active as Mary is
Don't tell stories!
What a preposterous question!
Please stop smoking!
Enjoy, dear
You're welcome
I'm starting to get cold
They've been trained
They've supported us
This isn't difficult
This isn't justified
Don't feel embarrassed
It's not unprecedented
That's absolutely true
That's another problem
That's basically right
That's clearly changed
That's fairly alarming
That's incredibly rude
That's probably unfair
That's really shocking
That's still happening
This isn't appropriate
Everyone's feeling good
Everything's been great
It's pretty interesting
Doing that wasn't complicated
They'll try to manipulate you
Tom showed me how it's done
Why aren't you sleepy?
Do we have any schnapps left?
You're a ruthless man
I've lost that ring
I haven't seen him for ages
Why didn't you come for lunch?
I don't feel well, sir
How much is this shirt?
I haven't seen Tom for ages
This is a pro-Israel narrative
What is the nature of Zionism?
What is the logic of Zionism?
Yitzhak is anti-Zionist

Get over yourself, Tom
Everybody's losing money
Everyone's losing money
Everybody's really happy
Everyone's really happy
Everybody's doing something
Everyone's doing something
That isn't mandatory
That's not mandatory
That's not too fun
It's cold in Boston
It's just too risky
We aren't convinced
Everything's perfect
It's still a mystery
That's going to happen
It'll make a difference
That's really important
You're wonderful people
Everything isn't perfect
Experts aren't convinced
It's worth investigating
That's worth investigating
That's basically correct
That's hardly surprising
That's highly improbable
That's perfectly obvious
That's pretty ridiculous
That's standard practice
That's totally justified
Well, that's interesting
Good afternoon, everybody
It's decision-making time
It's their responsibility
That's their responsibility
Tom wasn't intimidated
Tom wasn't intimidated by Mary
That's our responsibility
That's pretty encouraging
That's pretty significant
That's standard procedure
They've stolen everything
Eventually, that'll happen
Is it okay to use this?
At last!
Tom, it doesn't work that way

Are you having a good day?
I'm not feeling too great
She's jeopardizing her career
No, I think it's pretty stupid
Can you leave work early?
Is she normal?
Tom's neck is sore
Good choice!
Nicely done, kid
Really?
Is this newsworthy?
Why?
Is this positive news?
How can you ever be satisfied?
Is it just me?
Or do you concur?
I'm rubber, you're glue
I'm rubber, you're glue
Do you ladies need some help?
Do you girls need some help?
Tom wore flip-flops
Happy Canada Day," tweeted Tom
I'm not helpless, you know
This is a limited-time offer
I'd pay to see that
I'm so clumsy
It wasn't fun anymore
I doubt that it's possible
Are they laughing at me?
Will Tom be here today?
What is your e-mail address?
Has this gentleman gone, then?
How long did he wait?
Those were his very words, sir

Honestly you can't find it?
That's an issue
How many laps?
What was your time?
Tom was court-martialed
I know nothing!
How's life in Gaza
I'm shorter than she
Her name then was Mrs. Hebron
Tom, where are you?
I'm dying here
Where have you been?
I asked, more sternly
Do you have a Syrian passport?
You are not angry with me?
What do you mean?" she cried
Trust me, Jack!" she cried
I told Tom we're friends
Suddenly, my back seized up
Don't shoot till I tell you to
It is all surmise.
You have never seen this open.
I'll have the fish and chips
I'll have garlic fries
You're an idiot
Don't come back
How do you want your steak?
Do you want chicken fingers?
Can we get both?
That's because they're vicious

I've cut my shin open
How much have we spent?
It'll cost two hundred dollars

Why would I ever do that?
Who knew Tom would do that?
Why would I let Tom do that?
Why should I let Tom do that?
Have you had enough to eat?
Did you get enough to eat?
I'm going on the potato diet

It's first come, first served
What is a boutique hotel?
How long ago did he leave?
How long ago did she leave?
How did you get the job?
Let's take a selfie together
I didn't know he was married
Has anyone ever faced an ogre?
Tom's prayer was answered
She'll forgive you
I'm grateful for what I have
It wasn't there the last time
It's a touchy subject
Don't pay any attention to it
Italy's currency is the euro
What's in that dish?
What's the local specialty?
There's talk of an heir
I can't speak
He didn't respond
Why don't you sit down?
Get out, shabby!

You've got my word on it
You've been very kind
You're too good to me
You've made a mistake
You're very close now
You've found the problem
You've got that right
You've just been shot
You've got a point there
You're still not well
You've got to go to work
Don't do anything silly
Are you calling me fat?
You'd better stand back
Tom's goal was disallowed
Good morning, Tom
This is all I've got left
You've done well here
You've done very well
You're trying too hard
You're not helping me
You don't work for me
Do you think I'm kidding?
Are you sure you're ready?
Do you want me to try it?
You'll thank me later
Can you teach me to fight?
Can you teach me how to fight?
You can't touch the paintings
Can someone check this?
Did I cook for nothing?
You're such a pessimist
What are you up to with Mary?
What are you and Tom up to?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom doesn't get enough sleep
He's too cute for words!
You're Tom, aren't you?
You know Tom can't win
You've come a long way
You're just not trying
You're a lot like Tom
You can't go anywhere today
You don't have much time
You shouldn't do this
You'll never find them
You can't make me do that
You'd better get ready
You aren't fooling me
You shouldn't move it
You're going to have fun
You'd better get dressed
You'll get your chance
You can't go anywhere
You can't do anything
You're too aggressive
I'm the youngest child
Take the room's measurements
I'm sorry for my late response
We can't start today
Do you want to go shopping?
Do you think they noticed?
Do you think that'll work?
Do you think it's possible?
Do you still believe that?
Do you know how to use it?
Are you going to wait for me?
Are you a tax evader?
They're in ecstasy
I'm in ecstasy
I swear, I saw an alien!
You should've taken his advice
We don't say that anymore
That isn't said anymore
I don't feel well at all
My car isn't powerful enough
It's getting worse and worse
Dear, don't worry
You've made that clear
You've let yourself go
You've got two choices
You've got to move out
You're taking too much
You're making no sense
You aren't making sense
You're making it worse
You're going to prison
You're freaking me out
You're driving me nuts
You're doing very well
You're doing just fine
You're doing all right
You're being very rude
You've got paint on you
You've got to trust us
You've got to come see this
You've got to get rid of this
You've got to help them
You've got my word on that
You've got to believe that
You've got paint on your shirt
You've got a car, right?
You've got to do it now
You've been avoiding me
You've got to come with me
You've done a good job
You've got to get rid of it
You've got to come home
You've done your duty
You've got a bus to catch
You've done all you can
You've been pretty busy
You've lost too much blood
You've lost some blood
You've got to do better
You've got it backwards
You're a mean old woman
You own a car, don't you?
Tom's phone is huge
Did you buy some flowers?
You'll never catch me
You'll have to get help
You'll change your mind
You'll be taken care of
You'll be all right now
You'd look good in that dress
You'd better take it easy
You'd better get out of here
You'd better come with me
We don't repair PCs here
Okay, I'll drop it
Okay, I give up
He's shy and dreamy
We'll work this out amicably
Who are you, friend?
Don't take it wrong
What did he do here?
I can't take it for long
I can't stand it for long
Have you seen Tom's phone?
You're all under arrest
You're a smart guy
This is all that's left
I've never been to Tom's
I've been pretty busy
Have you made an appointment?
Have you been here all night?
Do you want to watch a movie?
Do you want to try it again?
Do you want to look at this?
Do you want to go to prison?
Do you want to go right now?
Do you want me to go home?
Do you think we were wrong?
Do you think Tom will say yes?
Do you think Tom will help us?
Do you think Tom is still up?
Do you think this is crazy?
Do you think this can work?
Do you think they heard us?
Do you think that's enough?
Do you still feel that way?
Do you really think I care?
Do you plan on using that?
Do you know what's in here?
Do you have anything for me?
Do you have anything better?
Did you see any footprints?
Did you follow any of that?
Could you explain that?
Can you handle all this?
Can you check it out for me?
Are you throwing me out?
Are you sure you're all right?
Are you sure nobody's hurt?
Are you still seeing Tom?
I'm old, but I'm not that old
I'll be back at 2:30
Are you here to see Tom?
Are you here to see Mary?
I'm busy with homework
You'd better leave it
Do you speak Inuktitut?
Where do you study?
It's OK to get angry with God
Tom now uses Windows 8.1
Maybe so.
I will!
I do!
Where's the burger patty?
What colour is the cloud?
I'm a translator
What happened, Tom?
What did you expect?
Your skin looks nice.
Oh?
First the immigrants, then you
First the immigrants, then you
First the immigrants, next you
You're here, aren't you?
You're old, aren't you?
You're shy, aren't you?
You're making me uneasy
You're making me uncomfortable
You're sure taking your time
You're going to love this
You're right about this
You're going to need these
You're just being silly
You're not making sense
You're going to be all right
You're kidding me, right?
You're getting old
You're not missing much
You're being too modest
You're going to miss me
You're a mean old man
You're the woman I love
You're doing a good job
You're going to love it
You're going to make it
You're going to need it
You're not hard to find
You're not going to die
You're better than I am
She's getting old
I think I'm the only one awake
Are you offering me a job?
You've left me no choice
You've got to reconsider
You've got to protect me
You've got to fight back
You've got to be kidding me
You've got three minutes
You've done what you can
You've done a superb job
You've been very nice to me
You've already done that
You sure are lazy, aren't you?
You're parked in my space
You've parked in my space
You're rich, aren't you?
You're not strong enough
You're not finished here
You're not even sweating
You're making me nervous
You're lying to me again
You're in over your head
You're home pretty early
You're good, aren't you?
You're going to do great
You're driving way too fast
You're doing all you can
You're doing a great job
You're being very unfair
You shouldn't lie to Tom
You shouldn't lie to me
You shouldn't have run
You shouldn't feel bad
You shouldn't do drugs
You should've taken it
You should've seen Tom dance
You should've done it
You should've called Tom
Do you want to watch football?
Do you want to know who he is?
Do you want to hear some more?
Do you want to have some fun?
Do you think we should do it?
Do you think Tom might say no?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
Do you think that was funny?
Do you think that scares me?
Do you think that could work?
Do you think that bugged Tom?
Do you think it's important?
Do you think I went too far?
Do you think I enjoyed that?
Tom's French is really good
Fuji?
What brought you to Korea?
Why use it?
Have you ever played poker?
Have you changed your mind?
Did you finish your homework?
Are you sure everything's OK?
Are you still looking for Tom?
Are you going to help us?
Are you going to go with Tom?
Are you all set to leave?
Are you afraid to go home?
She's a real witch!
Arabic isn't complicated
Arabic isn't hard
Why are you being mean to me?
You would've done the same
You'd have done the same
You'd better take a look
You'd better get started
You'd better get over here
You'd better get out here
You'd better get on with it
You'd better get here soon
You'd better get down here
You'd better get back here
You'd better check again
You'd better call Tom up
Are you guys OK?
That's not cool
That's hyper-cool!
'E' is not a Spanish word.
Yes, it is
You're mistaken.
You're a hard person to find
You're angry, aren't you?
You're bossy, aren't you?
You're crazy, aren't you?
You're getting close now
You're getting off track
You're going to wait, right?
You're looking real good
You're lucky, aren't you?
You're short, aren't you?
You've got to check this out
You've got to do this for me
You've got to face your fears
You've got to help me out
You've got to let me do this
You've got to snap out of it
You've got to think this out
Have you read the manual?
Did you read the instructions?
You don't look like Tom
You weren't kidding, were you?
You guys can't leave yet
You don't have to yell
You'd better rest a while
You'd better lead the way
You'll just have to wait
You'd better check it twice
You know it's not true
You know that's not true
You'd better look at this
You'll get through this
You know I can't do that
You know, I might just do that
You'll be seeing Tom soon
You don't have to shout
You'll do whatever I say
You used to teach, right?
You'll wait for me, right?
You couldn't be reached
You shouldn't go outside
You'd better check this out
You'll have to leave now
You're free to go for now
You're in trouble now
You shouldn't be nervous
You're right on the money
You don't even know me
You don't have to beg me
You've got to listen to me
You guys can't scare me
You said you'd help me
You should've woken me
You'll be fine without me
You're not even listening
You shouldn't be jealous
You didn't have to do it
You don't have to do it
You just can't ignore it
You know it's worth it
You know we can't do it
You'll have to handle it
You said it didn't hurt
You know why we're here
You'll have to come here
You're not even a student here
You guys aren't helping
You know it's not good
You're just not very good
You know it'll be fine
You know this isn't fair
You'll find someone else
You'll meet someone else
You know what I'm doing
You know I'm different
You couldn't be contacted
You'll get another chance
You said I'd get better
You'll have to handle it alone
You don't know me at all
I'm sorry I woke you up
I don't like riding the subway
You're not going to find Tom
You'll be hearing from us
You're going to need this
You're not going in there
You're too smart for that
You've got thirty seconds
You're trying my patience
You've got to hear me out
I'll never ever see you again
You've got a great memory
You'll be hearing from me
You've been so kind to me
You've got to be joking
You've been quite helpful
You're going to need help
You're acting like a fool
You've got to calm down
You'll never see me again
Does that taste good?
You think you're so smart
You think you're so funny
You don't need to do this
You don't need to come in
You don't look like a doctor
You don't like me, do you?
You don't have to be here
You don't have a name tag
You could've walked away
You could've run away
You could've just called
You could've come with me
You could've come over
You could've been killed
You could've been hurt
They could've run away
They could've walked away
You can read, can't you?
You can't just leave us
You can't do that to Tom
You can't win this
You can't throw me out
You can't turn back now
You can't do that to me
You can't get rid of me
You can't possibly leave
You can't just ignore it
You can't prove anything
You haven't changed a bit
You just don't get it, Tom
You'd better come out here
You're not even thirty yet
You're in a lot of trouble
You're pretty good at this
You've done enough already
You've already done enough
You're taking quite a risk
You're standing on my foot
You don't need to thank us
You don't have to thank us
You know that's impossible
You know we didn't do this
You didn't have to say yes
You're going to hurt yourself
You can fix it, can't you?
You can manage, can't you?
You can't take that with you
You didn't do it, did you?
You don't know Tom, do you?
You don't like Tom, do you?
You're nervous, aren't you?
You're scared, aren't you?
You can't go in there yet
You haven't even tried yet
You haven't met my family yet
You weren't here last year
You couldn't be more wrong
You can't possibly win
You don't know what I want
You should've kissed Tom
You're not going to catch Tom
You haven't got much time
You're running out of time
You don't need me for this
You're not going to like this
You've got to trust me on this
You don't have to say that
You shouldn't forget that
You're pretty good at that
You guys can't be serious
You know why I'm here, right?
You'd better get some rest
You'll be held responsible
You're far too pessimistic
You're just being paranoid
You're not being objective
You can't go right now
You shouldn't be here now
You'd better get moving
You're starting to bore me
You haven't been listening
You're going to lose your job
You're just doing your job
You know I didn't mean it
You're never going to make it
You'd better get back inside
You'd better take Tom home
You're going to be just fine
You're going to be exhausted
You've got to take it easy
You've got yourself a deal
You think you're so clever
You've been a very bad boy
You're going to love Boston
You're looking a bit bored
You're going to make me blush
You've lost a lot of blood
You can't leave Tom behind
Do you expect me to help you?
Were you surprised to see Tom?
Do you think I should do this?
Do you want me to count these?
Do you want me to go up there?
Are you sure this is the spot?
I've got two kids in school
Did you hear what I just said?
We've got too many rules
Do you really think I'm ready?
Do you want some help or not?
Why are you being so negative?
Do you think that's necessary?
Were you surprised to see me?
Do you think I should go home?
Are you almost done here?
I don't think you should drive
We're almost halfway done
We've got a lot in common
Are you backing out already?
Do you want me to do it again?
Do you want me to start again?
Do you want to try that again?
Do you want some free advice?
You're not just my wife
You're my best friend
I've become smarter
I've got get back to work
I've got to get me some work
Do you think I look like Tom?
I honestly can't remember
Stop doing that, please
Are you sure this is OK?
Don't leave the house
Did you walk all the way here?
I don't want to work here
We've got a good team here
I've got to get some shut eye
We've been disqualified
Are you sure Tom isn't busy?
You're a sight for sore eyes
I wish she'd stop smoking
You're going to get in trouble
You're a hard person to refuse
You said you'd be here by 2:30
You'd be crazy not to do that
You said you wouldn't do that
You're the best singer I know
Are you sure we can trust Tom?
You've had too much to drink
You've got to sign your name
You've got three months left
You've been so understanding
You've been a great audience
You're not going fast enough
You're just like your sister
You're just being ridiculous
You'll just have to trust me
You'll find this interesting
You'd better take care of it
You'd better come right away
You should've studied harder
You didn't know Tom, did you?
You could've all been killed
You can't have both of those
You've made me look foolish
You've got to stop this now
You've got a sharp eye, Tom
You've got a lot of enemies
You've done so much already
You've done a good job here
You've come a long way, Tom
You've been very kind to me
You've been a good audience
You're welcome to wait here
You're welcome back anytime
You're putting me on, right?
You're not saying very much
You're not missing anything
You're not doing this right
You're just like the others
You'll see me in 30 minutes
You'll have to come with us
You'll have to come with me
You'll get a kick out of it
You'll find this intriguing
You'll do as you're ordered
You shouldn't listen to Tom
You shouldn't be out of bed
You should've seen the fire
You said you'd do it for me
You need to do what's right
You know I won't lie to you
You know I don't have a car
You know I didn't mean that
You knew I wouldn't do that
You haven't lost your touch
You haven't lifted a finger
You haven't learned a thing
You hate to lose, don't you?
You don't need to know that
You don't need that, do you?
You don't live here, do you?
You don't know us very well
You don't know me very well
You don't have to go inside
You don't have to be afraid
You didn't say yes, did you?
You didn't find it, did you?
You can't have both of them
You can't be here right now
You're way too good for Tom
You've dropped your wallet
You're winning, aren't you?
You're wealthy, aren't you?
You're way too good for me
You're unhappy, aren't you?
You're kidding, aren't you?
You'd better call a lawyer
You shouldn't even be here
You shouldn't be back here
You and I aren't like that
You'll help me, won't you?
You'll enjoy working here
I'm not going to be there
You know I won't do that
You can't just walk away
You've dropped your pen
You've done a great job
You're making a mistake
You're doing great work
You know I didn't do it
You didn't have to come
You can't intimidate me
I'll never ever forget Tom
You aren't even trying
You've made Tom angry
You've made me angry
You've let me down
You'll lose
That's none of our business
You can do it, Tom
You've seen what we can do
We've done all we can do
You can do it, Tom
You're difficult to work with
You haven't worked in months
You're doing good work here
You've been working too hard
You're a pleasure to work for
You're not working hard enough
You've done a remarkable job
There's no guard
Should we try it?
I can't find my umbrella
Do you want help?
Did they find it?
Did Tom call you?
Did Tom see that?
Tom isn't strong
Tom isn't sneaky
Tom isn't skinny
Tom isn't polite
Does Tom like me?
Is Tom still mad?
Who did Tom kiss?
Did Tom enjoy it?
Has Tom tried it?
Tom isn't honest
Tom isn't greedy
Is Tom that good?
Tom isn't famous
How old were you then?
Does Tom need me?
Do you mean that?
Do you hear that?
Did you bring it?
Come on, help me
Tom won't beat me
Do you know Brian?
Yes, I know him well.
Really?
Since when do you know him?
I've known him for six years.
I've been here since June.
We haven't been here for long
We got here at 10:40
When did they leave?
They left twenty minutes ago.
He hasn't phoned for a month.
When did they start working?
Brian's all muddy
Do you live in Rome now?
Where's Mary?
She's in her room
She's studying
What horrible weather!
It's been raining all day
You're going to like this
Could you drop me off?
Why her and not me?
Why him and not me?
Let's forget this happened
You'll need it
You'll get used to the weather
I'm a friend of the princess
Have you got another plan?
I baked 20 cookies, not 19
I'm not mad at you anymore
You always pick his side!
I'm not going to school today!
Does this thing embarrass you?
We're used to staying up late
Never mind, come on!
What is the name of your dog?
Is it time to end it?
I do not feel free!
Why don't you implement it?
From now on, they'll be better
Warriors never complain!
Let's abolish football!
Let's abolish soccer!
He's another poor fool
I'm going to visit a friend
Isn't it scary?
It wasn't me who insulted you
What's the name of your dog?
Maybe it wasn't so obvious
You're fanning yourself
It's the height of luxury
It's the pinnacle of luxury
Do you have another plan?
We can't do without you
You've hurt me
What's up there?
What's all this?
We're waiting
They're here
There's no cure for that
That's my purse
Should I do it?
It's still hot
It's only me
It's just a toy
I'm disgusted
Hey, wait up
Tomorrow is the day!
I'm worried about the future
I'm thrilled with my purchase
He doesn't even know Mary
Why would Tom lie?
Did Tom do anything?
When is Tom due back?
When does Tom get back?
Does Tom like cats?
Has Tom been crying?
Does Tom disagree?
What else does Tom do?
What did Tom expect?
Who did Tom vote for?
What room is Tom in?
Why can't Tom do it?
Where did Tom buy it?
Does Tom enjoy it?
Will I see Tom later?
Why did Tom kiss me?
How will Tom stop me?
What'll Tom do now?
Does Tom have a pet?
Does Tom have any pets?
Will Tom be ready?
What if Tom is right?
Does Tom like swimming?
How does Tom do this?
Why did you fire Tom?
Hey, you're not Tom
Hey, where's Tom?
Hey look, it's Tom
Did somebody hit Tom?
Did I wake Tom up?
What if Tom is wrong?
What did Tom get you?
I don't love her.
Yes, you do.
I don't love him.
Yes, you do.
Would you shut up?
What's wrong now?
What should we do now?
What did you get?
We're way behind
We're very sorry
We're not dating
They're a couple
That's my jacket
It's a simple job
It's a conspiracy
It's a compliment
What is this about?
We're at the bank
That's pretty old
I'm not persuaded
I'm not lying now
I'm a little shy
How would I know?
Have you been there before?
Do you have anything else?
Can I go outside?
I want to have a sword!
I'll roast meat
I'll roast him some meat
I'll make some peanut butter
We'll buy some paraffin
They can't work
We'll work for them
You can't go to town
He'll go to town
He'll go to town for you
They'll build a house
They'll build you a house
I hope you'll be my friend
I don't even want you here
How do you stay up to date?
How do you get up to date?
Squeak", said the mouse
Tom, why are you doing this?
No, it wasn't her
No, it wasn't him
That was a misunderstanding!
Wait, who told you?
Is that weird?
You don't remember me, do you?
Did you really say that?
What's going to happen to you?
Do you have an extra blanket?
I don't mind
Do you need an extra blanket?
Can I get another blanket?
Are you okay?
No, I'm not.
I love Tom's Restaurant!
Who the hell are you anyway?
I don't mind
Were you mean to her?
It's time to call it a night
How many?
Actually, I have 4.
Whaat?
I didn't get his autograph
I didn't get her autograph
I wasn't trying to trick you
Should I be jealous?
Is Tom here?
No, he just left.
Really?
Why are you doing this?
Is Tom here?
No, he just left.
Really?
Did you really do that?
Did Tom get my message?
Did Tom seem OK to you?
Did Tom take Mary home?
Does Tom go to church?
Does Tom know my name?
Does Tom like it there?
Does Tom wear glasses?
How can I reach Tom?
How much does Tom weigh?
Is Tom very mad at me?
What did Tom get me?
What did you decide to do?
What more does Tom need?
What page is Tom on?
What took Tom so long?
Where did you decide to go?
Why did Tom leave you?
Why did Tom lie to me?
Why did you attack Tom?
Why did you let Tom go?
Why did you shoot Tom?
Why is Tom mad at me?
Why is Tom still here?
Your name is Tom, right?
Your name is Tom, isn't it?
I'm sorry
That's all I really remember
Bravo!
You're in the good spot
It's very humid, isn't it?
It's hard to surprise Tom
It could've been Tom
I'm sure Tom misses you
I've already considered that
I'll never go back to Boston
What do you propose we do?
What should I have done?
Do you mind if I sleep here?
I'll sleep on the floor
I couldn't say
Are you angry at me?
Who else knows about this?
I'm aware of the danger
Mary isn't all that cute
I'll see you in hell
I don't think your name's Tom
Hey, Tom, open up
Get over here, Tom
It's me again, Tom
Come over here, Tom
Do you need me, Tom?
Get used to it, Tom
Say good night, Tom
That's no good, Tom
Glad to see you, Tom
Have a nice day, Tom
I love you, too, Tom
Look around you, Tom
Nice to see you, Tom
Try to be brave, Tom
Is Tom there already?
Aren't you going to miss Tom?
Where can we find Tom?
See you next week, Tom
Where was Tom yesterday?
What do you do here, Tom?
We're almost home now, Tom
If Tom is happy, I'm happy
Are you positive it was Tom?
You're just as crazy as Tom
How did Tom feel about that?
You're confusing me with Tom
You're just as stupid as Tom
I'm not sharing this with Tom
I get up and read my email.
Well, almost
I like the movie "Me
Mary is used to Tom's moods
She doesn't wash the dishes
How do you know Tom?
Mary dated him.
Oooh, I see.
How do you know Tom?
It's a long story.
We're friends, nothing more
I don't believe you!
I swear!
Were you ever good at sports?
That's not very nice
That's not very original
Do you want to come?
I guess we're even now
I thought you didn't drink
Ooh, you don't know?
Breaking up wasn't enough
What will my parents think?
Why are you always here?
Mary isn't that pretty
Don't lie about your age
You're making too much noise
You're on the wrong road
You're running short of time
Please don't change anything
You didn't eat very much
You think I did it, don't you?
You know you don't mean that
You know who I am, don't you?
You know I don't believe you
You know his name, don't you?
You don't seem afraid at all
You don't seem tired at all
You don't scare easy, do you?
You don't need to be nervous
You know that's not possible
You aren't thinking straight
You haven't convinced me yet
You shouldn't have called me
You should've called the cops
You should've let me help you
You don't know how bad it is
You don't know that for sure
You don't know all the facts
You don't have to yell at me
You don't have to go, do you?
May I take a look at it?
You'll land on your feet
You don't look like a cop
I don't do stuff like that
You don't even know my name

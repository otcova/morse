There's a lot of traffic today
That's not what I meant to say
That isn't what I meant to say
It's too hot to work right now
It's not always cold in Boston
It's likely to be hot tomorrow
It's likely that Tom will come
I'm writing this letter to Tom
I'm worried about Tom's health
I'm really disappointed in you
I'm not sure, but Tom may come
I'm getting married next month
I'm fed up with Tom's behavior
I'll wait for you in the lobby
I'll meet you at 2:30 tomorrow
I'll do anything within reason
I'll ask Tom about it tomorrow
I shouldn't have gone anywhere
I can't speak French very well
You're better off without Tom
You're a really bad bartender
You'll never get Tom to agree
You guys will be there, right?
What's the title of that book?
We're three hours from Boston
We're on the same team, right?
We're not leaving without you
We're not certain of that yet
We're going to leave tomorrow
We'll be there in three hours
Tom must've forgotten his key
Tom isn't a young guy anymore
They're both wearing uniforms
There's a time for everything
That's my umbrella, not Tom's
It's never too late to change
It was Tom's fault, not yours
Is that really what you think?
I'm used to this cold weather
I'm sorry I can't go with you
I'm seeing Tom this afternoon
I'm not the least bit worried
I'm afraid Tom might get hurt
I'm about the same age as you
I'll leave when Tom gets here
I'll keep your advice in mind
I'll come back this afternoon
I don't like what you've done
I can't get in touch with Tom
I can't bear the pain anymore
Do you know what Tom is up to?
Are you traveling by yourself?
You're very rich, aren't you?
You're usually so optimistic
You're twice as strong as me
You're about my age, I think
You're a really bad listener
You'll miss me when I'm gone
You can't swim well, can you?
We're prepared for the worst
We're not ready to order yet
We're happy to see you again
We're crazy about each other
We're both in the same class
We'll get married in October
We'll accept your conditions
Tom isn't as young as we are
Tom is from Boston, isn't he?
Tom didn't really understand
Tom can't be older than Mary
They're talking about sports
There's no question about it
There's a park near my house
It's rude to stare at people
It's rude to point at people
It's really hot this morning
It's not like Tom to be late
It's no use trying to escape
It's likely to rain tomorrow
It's a privilege to meet you
Is this absolutely necessary?
I'm the tallest in our class
I'm pleased with the results
I'm going to major in French
I'm going abroad next summer
I'm a teacher, not a student
I'll give Tom another chance
I won't allow you to do that
I can't read without glasses
Do you actually believe that?
Are you guys having problems?
You're stronger than Tom is
You're no younger than I am
You're busy now, aren't you?
You're better than they are
You're a really good kisser
You'd be crazy to leave now
Whatever you do, don't move
What's Tom's brother's name?
What's Tom so curious about?
What Tom said can't be true
What really happened to Tom?
We're running short of food
We're not selling our house
We're both on the same side
They're not my real parents
They're both older than you
They aren't my real parents
There's something in my eye
There's not much paper left
There's no one in the house
That's not possible anymore
That's not important, is it?
That was my idea, not Tom's
It's too late to go out now
It's cheaper to go by train
I'm meeting Tom next Monday
I'm in Boston all this week
I'm having a very hard time
I'm going to leave tomorrow
I'll do it as soon as I can
I'll be with you right away
I'll be free this afternoon
I'll be busy this afternoon
Do you have a favorite song?
Do you guys know each other?
Did you really believe that?
Are you guys really cousins?
Are you absolutely positive?
You're wanted on the phone
You're the reason I'm here
You're safer where you are
You're really good at this
You're really good at that
You're not coming, are you?
You're mistaken about that
You're an interesting girl
You're a little overweight
You should've known better
What's the meaning of this?
We're going to have a baby
We're better than they are
Tom can't be older than me
They're willing to help us
There's nothing to do here
There's a leak in the roof
That's out of the question
It's windy today, isn't it?
It's not worth the trouble
It's not that weird, is it?
It's nice to see you again
It's kind of hot, isn't it?
It's impossible to do that
It's a pity you can't come
It was my fault, not Tom's
It was my error, not Tom's
It isn't worth the trouble
I'm sorry I can't help you
I'm running short of money
I'm not very good at chess
I'm not interested in this
I'm not certain about that
I'm going to see Tom today
I'm going out this evening
I'll be busy all afternoon
I can't run as fast as Tom
I can't eat anything today
Do you really believe this?
Do you guys need some help?
You're safe here with me
You're on the wrong train
You're from Boston, right?
You're deceiving yourself
You're absolutely correct
You're a very sick person
You're a very pretty girl
You're a very good singer
You're a very good artist
What's Tom so happy about?
What's Tom so angry about?
What's all the fuss about?
We've known Tom for years
We've actually met before
We're really good friends
We're next-door neighbors
We'll meet in three hours
We'll continue this later
We are short of time, Tom
This door can't be locked
There's a message for you
There's a map on the wall
That's not unusual, is it?
That's no longer possible
That wasn't our agreement
Surely that's unnecessary
Mary isn't really my type
It's not that interesting
It's not Christmas, is it?
It's getting dark outside
I'm sure Tom will succeed
I'm really good at my job
I'm not much of a swimmer
I'm not happy with my job
I'm not carrying any cash
I'm never free on Mondays
I'm at home every evening
I'm almost as tall as Tom
I'm a fairly fast swimmer
I'll tell Tom what I know
I'll never change my mind
I'll look into the matter
I'll do what I need to do
I'll do anything but that
I can't fix this computer
Do you guys need anything?
You're stronger than Tom
You're a really bad liar
You're a really bad cook
What's Tom worried about?
We'll discuss that later
Tom can't ride a bicycle
Tom can't be over thirty
They're willing to do it
They're not coming today
They're building a house
They aren't coming today
That's worth considering
That's not your decision
That's not a coincidence
It's still light outside
It's not that ridiculous
It's not that noticeable
It's not that bad, is it?
It's not our anniversary
It's not my fault, is it?
It's nice and warm today
It's nice and cool today
It's likely to rain soon
It's hard to lose weight
Is Tom really a Canadian?
Is this really necessary?
I'm bored out of my mind
I'll do anything you ask
I'll be at home tomorrow
I won't be free tomorrow
I won't be busy tomorrow
I won't attend the party
I can't get this lid off
Are you really not going?
You're such a hypocrite
You're really very good
You're on the wrong bus
You're lost, aren't you?
You're completely wrong
You're absolutely wrong
You're a true gentleman
You'll be busy tomorrow
What's your nationality?
We're worried about Tom
We're sick of your lies
We're moving next month
We're in the same class
We'll have a lot of fun
We won't be intimidated
Tom, is that really you?
They're both very smart
There's plenty of water
There's no time to lose
There's no school today
That's really good news
That's not my signature
So what really happened?
It's wrong to tell lies
It's still dark outside
It's not that difficult
I'm the same age as Tom
I'm taking tomorrow off
I'm really disappointed
I'm now learning French
I'm not as young as Tom
I'm free this afternoon
Have you ever had a pet?
Have we ever met before?
Do you really need that?
Are you really a doctor?
Are you having problems?
Are you absolutely sure?
You're very courageous
You're such a bad liar
You're quicker than me
You're probably right
You're both very lucky
You're as tall as I am
You're a good customer
You'll never defeat us
You'll never defeat me
You'll help, won't you?
You'll be safe with me
You'd be crazy to stay
What's Tom's wife like?
What's Tom's nationality?
What's Tom angry about?
We're both out of luck
We're all in agreement
We're all going to die
We'll be together soon
We'll be there shortly
We can't both be right
We both can't be right
Tom can't be relied on
They're both unmarried
They won't believe you
There's plenty of food
There's a page missing
That's not my decision
That's not fair, is it?
It's pretty warm today
It's pretty cold today
It's not so cold today
It's a serious problem
It isn't so cold today
It doesn't matter, Tom
I'm not good at sports
I'm not as tall as Tom
I'm not as busy as Tom
I'll try to do my best
I'll see Tom next week
I'll help Tom tomorrow
I'll explain it to Tom
Have you guys ever met?
Do you need assistance?
Did you really like it?
Are you guys really OK?
You'll be better soon
We're not through yet
We're not really sure
We're better than you
We're a perfect match
We'll be back by 2:30
Tom can't drive a car
They're my classmates
That's very expensive
That's Tom's umbrella
That's quite possible
That's not my opinion
That's almost correct
Let's travel together
Let's sing some songs
It's quite warm today
It's not that strange
It's not so hot today
It's not an emergency
It isn't so hot today
I'm too tired to help
I'm in charge of that
I'm aware of the fact
I'm afraid it'll rain
I'll pay you tomorrow
I'll be here tomorrow
I'll ask Tom tomorrow
I can't come tomorrow
Have you ever met Tom?
You're such an idiot
You're really clumsy
You're a true friend
What's Tom up to now?
What's this used for?
What's the next stop?
What's our situation?
They're the same age
They're both artists
They'll be here soon
There's no salt left
There's no milk left
There's no food left
It's under the chair
It's too cold for me
It's not my decision
It's not my birthday
It's me that's wrong
It isn't raining now
I'm totally confused
I'm shorter than you
I'm not good at math
I'm not coming today
I'm glad to help you
I'm as strong as you
I'll miss this place
I'll call back later
I'll be back by 2:30
You're very patient
You're really weird
You're confusing me
You're always wrong
What's your address?
What's this made of?
What's it all about?
What else can we do?
We're out of danger
We're not criminals
We'll come together
They're vegetarians
That's not your job
It's wrong to steal
It's very cold here
It's too hot for me
It's not on the map
It's not my concern
It's not cold today
It's in the kitchen
I'm willing to help
I'm taller than Tom
I'm not from Boston
I'm leaving at 2:30
I'm glad I met you
I'm free until 2:30
I'm extremely tired
I'll never hurt you
I'll find it myself
Don't be frightened
You're such a snob
You're such a brat
You're so immature
You're really fast
You're really cute
You're always late
You're a true hero
You're a good cook
You'll regret this
What's your number?
What's our problem?
What's for dessert?
We're through here
We won't surrender
They're all hungry
It's under the bed
It's not that nice
I'm a teacher, too
I can't lie to Tom
You're my friends
What's Tom eating?
We're not worried
We'll do our best
They're all happy
They're all alike
They aren't happy
That's surprising
That's intriguing
It's cold outside
I'm in Boston now
Are you really OK?
Are you bored yet?
Tom, hurry it up
They're well off
They're teachers
It's windy today
It's snowing now
It's raining now
It's clearing up
It can't be done
Is Tom really OK?
I'm very unhappy
I'm right-handed
I'm coming today
I'm a lonely man
You're blushing
What's our plan?
Tom can't drive
That's not safe
That isn't safe
It's very short
I'm out of work
I'm out of time
I'm on duty now
I'm now on duty
I'm getting fat
It's not blood
I'm busy today
I'm a bachelor
Tom, hurry up
That's my dog
You're early
I'm homesick
It's warm
I'm warm
Let's listen to some Chopin
You're getting worse
Yes, the apple is red
Do you speak Irish?
Thanks and good night!
Yes, you need glasses
Please don't do it
Thanks!
I'll see you soon!
I'm Irish
I don't speak Irish
Agreed, see you later
Count me out!
I'm a bad person
It's three o'clock
It's four o'clock
It's six o'clock
It's eight o'clock
It's nine o'clock
It's eleven o'clock
It's twelve o'clock
I'm under the tree
I miss you guys so much!
I'm fine, and you?
We've painted the walls white
I didn't want to annoy you
Have you vomited yet?
Yes, I have a stomach ache
Will I need a prescription?
Can I go to school?
What was all the shooting?
What did they reply?
What did you reply?
What did he reply?
What did she reply?
I didn't catch the last word
Say it again, please
That's where the trouble lies
What is the matter?
What did Tom reply?
How did Tom reply?
I've never been skiing
I've never been skiing before
Are you on the road again?
Hello, I'm Halil
Can he do whatever he wants?
I'd rather not go out today
That's nice
I'm able to speak Spanish
We're doing fine so far
We're doing OK so far
You've been right so far
You've been lucky so far
You've done good work so far
You're doing a good job so far
I like what I've seen so far
Kill him!
How many squares can you see?
What is Tom eating?
I'm eating a pineapple
Come on, give me a kiss
I don't understand
No, I don't!
I'm Thai
I'm not going to kiss you, Tom
Why did you kiss him?
Should I let him kiss me?
Please stop singing!
I'm trying to be happy
Sorry, I have to study
They didn't pay me
Not everybody wins!
Everybody wins!
December 24th is Christmas Eve
Come on, tell him!
Come on, tell her!
Come on, tell me!
Do we have time?
We should've planned for this
You should've never interfered
You should've phoned
We should've both stayed awake
Tom should've listened to you
We should've stayed with Tom
Tom should've protected Mary
You should've said yes
Tom should've said no
You should've notified us
You should've come with us
You should've trusted me
You should've warned me
I'm sorry
You should've never come here
You should've phoned me
You should've called me
You should've done it yourself
I shouldn't have kissed him
Don't get us confused
Don't get me confused
Don't get her confused
Don't get him confused
Don't get them confused
Don't get everybody confused
You should've been with us
You should've been a farmer
Tom should've been back by now
We should've left earlier
You should've been there
You should've come by train
Is Brigitte your friend?
I should've worn a coat
They'll make a new mistake
It's always a pleasure
You should've told the truth
I should've told you sooner
Happy birthday, Aiba!
I'm Nancy
My mother wasn't a good mother
What is a good life?
Is this edible?
It's a peacock
He's watching TV
You never should've done that
You should've heard Tom sing
You should've heard me
Tom, you look very sleepy
It's time the kids went to bed
It's cold
Could you close the window?
Tom?
Did something happen?
Why is he busy?
Then I'll see what I can do!
What's that, a love square?
It's a good cure for hangovers
How much do you take?
How many do you take?
How much are you taking?
How many are you taking?
Oh, look
Tursun's here
I've never seen one
Here's my phone number
I can't find it anywhere
It's driving me mad!
We couldn't agree on anything
I'm going right now
He'll be here right away
There's his bag
There's the plane from Urumqi
Do you want to do it again?
It's the perfect opportunity!
Oh, there you go
See?
What are "kulasy"?
How about a kick in the ass?
No?
You're a pain in the ass
He'll piss on everything
What do you say to that?
Tom isn't photogenic
What do you need a baby for?
Now listen, sir
You won't find a better price
This I promise you!
You may not!
Don't!
Who are you going to believe?
Her or me?
He's been blacklisted
I don't want to offend Tom
The enemy is weakened!
You bring me to life..
Big deal!
I'm eating a yogurt
She's in a bad mood
What's happening next week?
What's happening in Italy?
Welcome to Dublin!
What on earth has happened?
I'd like a cup of tea, please
Wouldn't you like to know?
I'm upstairs
He isn't so tall
Such a small world!
You're in for a real surprise
Tom isn't his real name
He's great in bed
He's good in the sack
Do you know Tom's real name?
Do you know Tom's full name?
Take a chance!
We both know this isn't real
I'm happy that I was born
I'm loving it
Fine, have it your way
You'll like it
Will you be ready?
When Tom talks, people listen
Must I go on?
What happens here, stays here
Where do you want to go today?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
No, I can't hear you!
There's a waterfall nearby.
I don't have any illusions
You'll regret it someday
You'll regret it one day
He didn't like that very much
He's terrible in bed
He's bad in bed
She's terrible in bed
She's bad in bed
I'm not impersonating you
Don't impersonate me
He doesn't want to get married
He always thinks he's right
Why don't you leave him then?
She always thinks she's right
It's not a toy
What do you seek, human?
I'm sorry, sir
I'm sorry, madam
I want pizza!
She's nasty and mean
Shut up, bitch!
OK, you win
I drink too much!
I don't drink a lot
That's sad for you
I'm not stupid
I'm just bad at math
My, how you've grown!
Do you know Tom's secret?
It's a family secret
How is your host family?
Do you want to know a secret?
Do not hit me so hard!
He's a professional diver
Give me back my wig!
Will you give it to me?
He's a valiant soldier
I'm a klutz
How can you do this to me?
How could you do this to me?
She's sexually frustrated
It was mind-numbingly boring
Is he cute?
What do you know about pandas?
They're on our side
He's on our side
Pinocchio, you wicked boy!
I'll live in Cambodia
Please, be patient with me!
That sounds awesome!
It seems we're sick
She's not sick
I'm fine and I'm not sick
I'm eating bread
You didn't dress yourself
You don't dress yourselves
You can't drive
He can't drive
I'm not bad!
They're not bad!
I won't come because I'm sick
They're not bad at all!
I'm not bad at all!
With kindness, comes naivété
It's so racist
He's so racist
She's so racist
Which one will you get?
Do you like the colors?
I don't regret it at all
He can't afford to retire
This doesn't seem normal
It wasn't always this way
Catch him!
Catch him!
Catch her!
Catch her!
And what can that be?
Careful, ugly Cricket!
Why?
What is Freedom Flotilla?
Do you wear shoes indoors?
That's just an old wives' tale
I'm glad it works for you
I'm in the post office
Where's the water?
It evaporated.
He's tall and muscular
She's just so fake
How cold is Canada?
Open!
How did you burn your feet?
Bad, very bad!
I don't like them
But I am not like other boys!
Close your eyes and sleep!
Where's your coat, Father?
I have sold it.
Why did you sell your coat?
It was too warm.
Tomorrow I'll go to school
What is that house?
Read the sign and you'll know.
Enough!
Be quiet!
I'll take care of you later
Father, save me!
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!
Look at me," said the Fox
Look at me," said the Cat
Why did you kill him?
What do you mean?
We work only to enrich others.
I am with you.
Who are you?" he asked
Your money or your life!
No, no, no, not my Father!
I also am dead.
Dead?
He is rude, lazy, a runaway
Drink it!
I don't like anything bitter.
Do you promise?
Yes.
I won't drink this awful water
I won't
I won't!
No, no, no, no!
Aren't you afraid of death?
Give me that glass!
Quick, please!
I don't want to die!
It's the best feeling
Why do you laugh?
I am laughing at your lies.
How do you know I'm lying?
I'm sad now
I won't do it again.
There's no going back
What are you guys doing?
Poor Pinocchio!
Can't you see?
I'm crying.
I'll save him!
I'll save my father!
He's always nice to everyone
This is no place for me!
Hey boys, what's up?
Hey guys, what's up?
Hey girls, what's up?
I hate my friends!
Aren't you ashamed?
I'm not a good beachcomber
It's not likely but possible
Tom wasn't waiting for me
Tom wasn't awaiting me
Where else do you want to go?
That is just silly!
I'm on call.
What is that book about?
Do you still have a headache?
It's almost like magic
I didn't lose
I just couldn't win
He's a hired gun
Mary's cat is a nasty beast
I'm not his type
Not a word to Tom!
What kind of apes are those?
He'll leave by plane tomorrow
He works well, just as usual
He wears black-rimmed glasses
It's true that he said that
Could you carry it to the car?
I didn't believe him at all
I'm allergic to pollen
I'm at ease in English
I'm comfortable in English
I'm at home in English
Do you know who I am?
He's dead?
I think of you, and I smile
I've got some suggestions
Is your headache gone?
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Don't apologize
Let's win this duel
What happened to Megan Fox?
No, it's not normal
I'm ruining my clothing
You're ruining your clothing
They're ruining their clothing
We're not ruining our clothing
You'll ruin your clothing
He'll ruin his clothing
She'll ruin her clothing
That's a secret!
Woe betide the lazy fellow!
Take care, Pinocchio!
Have you heard the news?
No!
What do you care about school?
And what will the teacher say?
Poor boy!
Hey there, boys!
Where's that shark?
The joke's on you
What do you want me to do?
We'll whip you soundly!
Stop fighting, you rascals!
Oh, Mother, help!
I'm dying!
Eugene!
My poor Eugene!
Open your eyes and look at me!
Why don't you answer?
Are you not frightened?
In which city are you?
In which town are you?
Which one did you choose?
Which game did you choose?
I can't make up my mind
He can't make up his mind
She can't make up her mind
Mary can't make up her mind
We can't make up our mind
They can't make up their mind
He doesn't know his neighbors
She doesn't know her neighbors
You just left, didn't you?
I prefer whole-grain cereals
He prefers whole-grain cereals
We prefer whole-grain cereals
What mistake was that?
You didn't pass the test?
What a nitpicker!
Do you really love Tom?
I'm not a pervert
Yeah, yeah, give me a break.
She's an all-American girl
Why does she call me cute?
I'm not a rabbit
Of course I love her!
I'll need to think about it
Can you take me?
Go by yourself!
Where is my diary?
Do you all learn Esperanto?
What are the positives?
What are the positive aspects?
I can't read lips
Should I learn Esperanto?
Her boyfriend's a nice lad
I, too, am worried about Tom
I've been waiting an hour
You don’t have to be on time
Please stand back!
She's cleaning the book
I'd like to have a spoon
I'd like to have a knife
Thanks, bud!
Thanks, buddy!
Do they do that often?
Tom's been blacklisted
It's a very simple idea
What's worrying you, Tom?
It's a bottomless glass
I'll heat up the soup for you
How much interest does it pay?
Why do you insist on going?
I insist that I'm innocent
Sorry, it can't be helped
Let's wait till high tide
Is that too heavy for you?
Have you hidden anything?
What do you want instead?
The light hit Tom's eyes
Don't turn it inside out
Is this intended for me?
How did you hit on that?
Tom's field is history
Does this interest you?
Can't you take a hint?
Come here, young man
You're an awful hog
Don't hog the road
Don't be insulted
Are you insured?
I don't have enough friends
He doesn't have enough friends
We don't have enough friends
They don't have enough friends
I haven't called
You haven't called, have you?
He hasn't called
She hasn't called
Mary hasn't called
We haven't called
They haven't called
Is the park open today?
He's drinking water
He's so cute when he does that
I come home at 2:30
He's a Pisces
She's a Pisces
Nice to meet you!
Glad to meet you!
Was she always that fat?

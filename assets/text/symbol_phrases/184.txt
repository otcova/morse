That's undeniable
They're a bunch of gun nuts
What else you got going on ?
Alright, Sir
Don't be a moron
The dead ones won't be here
I'll put my foot down
Are you in acceptable health?
At work it’s like a holiday
Let’s join hands, friends!
Such a stud!
You’re buff!
Could it be worse ?
What is the difference?
How old are your parents?

Are you willing to help Tom?
What kind of rope is this?
What kind of jewel is this?
Tom isn't cut out for this
Tom isn't in the mood for this
Here, drink this
So let's do this
They can't do this
I've got to do this

I'll arrive on 23 May
I don't think like you
Have you brushed your teeth?
Police state!
You're not a lawyer
Where did you hide it?
What is the secret of success?
Life's too short
That's what you get!
I work here, I'm not a guest
Got any baccy?
Don't be so choosy
Any clues?
Let's hit the road
Tom's hooked on cigarettes
What hype!
Is he always like that?
Is she always like that?
He's always like that
She's always like that
What's your name?
Tatoeba.
Is that your real name?
No.
Why didn't I think of that?
Because you're an idiot.
East or West, home is best
Who's that there?
Who's ill?
Who invited you to the party?
How're they doing that?
I've gotta go
Thanks!
You'll work it off.
She won't get scared
That's impressive
But you're not a Jedi yet
I've got a visual on a hostile
We're heading north
I'll look into this issue more
Repent, the end is nigh!
I don't know what went wrong
We don't know what went wrong
Don't move a muscle
They double-crossed us
I'm between jobs at the moment
I know I'm not a likable guy
I'm not taking any orders
Do you do charity?
I've betrayed my husband
But now it's too late
Show, don't tell
Who can speak Japanese?
I don't want to learn French
Who wants to learn Japanese?
You're lying to me now
Have you seen the film before?
Emily's eating crisps
Relax, you're doing fine
War doesn't pay

I'm not your date!
You don't have a girlfriend?

No.
What about a boyfriend?
Mary is Tom's only daughter
Tom Jr. is Tom's only son
Where's Tom?
Oh, there you are!
That's what they all say
I think I'll just go home.
You're doing fine
Did you and Tom have a fight?
Did you and Mary have a fight?
Tom's feet are really big
These headphones don't work
I'll tell them what I think
So, she's English
When are you coming to Boston?
You don't need to be afraid
Life?
Don't tell me about life
It's endless
Dad, buy me a gun!
At home, we only use French
At home, we only speak French
At home, we speak only French
Where did you do time?
Finally," replied Maria
Is Lojban ambiguous?
Squadala, we're off!
What does 'squadala' mean?
Squadala!
Fuck yeah!
No, I was here last year.
She's reading a book
I can't make out what Tom says
Is the examiner French?
Are you still awake?
You're still awake?
Could you hang up the laundry?
I'm sorry
Sorry!
You waited?
Thank you!
Sorry!

She's a real character
Who wants a hot chocolate?
Does this not please you?
Let's get the hell out of here

What would your mother think?
She's never going to find out.
So, please do so
The money's on the table
And it worked!
I'm not guilty of anything
No, you can't use my car!
Why do you drink a lot?
You don't have to be a victim
You're glowing
Who could not love you?
Who else could you be?
Never lose hope!
Where the hell were you?
Now my life will be better!
Francis, is this yours?
The kind who love me.
That's hard!
Was that always there?
No!
It's just a figure of speech
You're a dead man
Tom's death was an accident
Tom's death was an accident.
Are you sure?
What a tawdry dress!
What is all this rumpus about?
I'd like to forget Marika
What do you wanna eat?
What?!
Tom's speaking Dutch!
He can't wait to see you
It's nice of you to come
Hey, what's up?
Oh, not much.
Hey, what are you doing today?
Oh, not much.
Yes," replied Mary decisively
No," replied Tom decisively
Sir, have you been drinking?
Where do dreams come from?
I've paid my debt to society
You can't keep doing this, Tom
Is this about the other night?
Can we meet tomorrow?
Why are you so secretive?
Do you have psychic powers?
Bite me!
Tell her I'm on my way
Tell him I'm on my way
I've changed
I'm not comfortable with this
I'm sure you'll do very well
I don't have a lot of time
What is this cat doing?
What is that cat doing?
How did you know?
Do you have a cell phone, Tom?
Do you have a mobile, Tom?
Who told you that?
Why are you doing that?
You're getting my shirt wet!
I'm heading to London
No one would have guessed it!
How does that sound to you?
I don't need a tutor!
It was more than 10 years ago
I should've stayed in bed
Tom moved to Boston in 2013
Tom left the house about 2:30
Tom probably went to Mary's
I'm sorry
I can't let you in
Did Tom ever ask about Mary?
Tom isn't worried about Mary
Did Tom ask Mary about me?
Did Tom ever ask about me?
Tom must've done it yesterday
Tom makes over $300,000 a year
Thank you!
It was my pleasure.
It's very improbable
I'm now fairly certain
Tom must've gone another way
That's completely unfair
Do you have a pen I could use?
Did Tom say anything about us?
He's not my friend.
I've removed the comma
Tom must've missed the train
Let me see that again, Tom
Do you want my email address?
So, what's it gonna be?
Tom never would've done this
Do I really have to do this?
Tom said my plan wouldn't work
Tom said he'd be here tonight
Tom said he'd call tomorrow
Tom said he wasn't tired
Tom said he didn't like this
Tom said he wasn't surprised

Tom said you'd be coming by
Tom said he wasn't busy
Tom said he couldn't breathe
Tom said he'd be right back
Tom said he'd call me back
Tom is his name, I think
Tom never would've said that
They'd better fix it soon
Tom must've been scared
I'm like a stone in your shoe
That isn't what I said
It's not a snake
It's only a piece of rope
Tom isn't too bright
Tom offered you a job, right?
Maybe that's the reason
I don't want it to change
I don't want to change it
I don't want it changed
Tom looks as if he's in pain
I just can't keep my eyes open
Tom realizes what's going on
What a temperament!
That's really bad news
Tom must've been nervous
Tom knew he'd said too much
Tom must've made some mistakes
I'm leaving in ten minutes
Dogs can't distinguish colors
Don't move!
You take a step and you die!
Was the victim male or female?
It's not my fault
That's a pretty name
What's your name?
Mary.
That's a pretty name.
I don't expect to be gone long
Let's go and take a look
Tom lost his driver's license
Can you slow down a little?
Tom's fingers are really long
He retired at the age of 71
Dammit, Tom, not again!
Why don't you get a job?
It's Tom
What's he doing out here?
It's Mary
What is she doing out here?
But he's so cute!
What's he doing out here?
What is she doing out here?
Don't worry, Tom
Tom promised me he'd do it
I don't know.
Why are you interested in me?
Do you like my T-shirt?
Let's get back inside
Tom doesn't like the idea
People could've been hurt
I'll be at home
Can you lengthen it?
Nobody knows you're here
Tom probably forgot it's here
Tom might know that we're here
O Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou Romeo?
It must've been love
Tom looks busy, doesn't he?
Tom looks sleepy, doesn't he?
Tom looks tired, doesn't he?
Tom must've worked very hard
Perhaps you're trying too hard
Shit!
That's so fucking awesome!
Popov is a traitor?
How?
Hell knows.
It's manna from heaven
What is high sensitivity?
Tom must've heard us enter
I think you've eaten enough
I think you've drunk enough
There's nothing up here
What is it this time?
What's the problem this time?
I'm walking in the park
Tom promised me that he'd come
I'll keep my eyes closed
Tom promised me he'd come back
We'll decide later
The infinite!
What's this flower called?
That's not an answer
I'm pretty good at first aid
You're older than Tom
Could you wait a little while?
Tom says he's busy today
When pigs fly!
Tom shouldn't have been there
Tom shouldn't even be there
Oh, bother
How about filming in Siberia?
Impossible!

Can both of us stay here?
If I could stay, I would
You'll stay here tonight
You've got to stay awake
Are you asking me to stay?
I should've stayed longer
I'm going to have to stay
It's a pity we can't stay
I'll go get it
This stays between us, OK?
We've got to stay focused
Why did you stay with Tom?
Why don't I stay with Tom?
Why don't we just stay in?
Would you like me to stay?
Capitalism can’t run backwards
You stay out of this, Tom
Are you staying for dinner?
Can I stay a little longer?
Can't I stay here with you?
Could you stay out of this?
Do you mind if I stay here?
I think I'll stay in today
Stay away from Tom's house
Stay where you are, please
That's why I stayed behind
Tom isn't planning to stay
We'll stay out of your way
We've got to stay together
Why couldn't Tom stay here?
Would you rather stay here?
Would you stay right there?
Are you really here to stay?
Are you sure you can't stay?
Can't you stay here with us?
Did you stay here all night?
Do you have a place to stay?
I should've stayed with Tom
I'll stay close to the door
Let's try and stay calm, OK?
Maybe you can stay at Tom's
Tom, you'd better stay here
We'll stay out of their way
Why is Tom staying with you?
You stay where you are, Tom
You'll die if you stay here
Do you and Tom stay in touch?
Should I stay or should I go?
We'll just stay where we are
We'll stay as long as we can
Are you going to stay with us?
Is Tom still staying with you?
It was Tom's decision to stay
Tom is staying at his uncle's
Well, you're not staying here
What hotel are you staying in?
Does Tom need a place to stay?
We hope you'll enjoy your stay
We'll stay as long as possible
You can't stay here any longer
I'm sick of it
How sick is Tom?
Tell Tom I'm sick
Tom can't be sick
Are you sick of me?
I'm sick of school
I'm sick of waiting
We know you're sick
I'm not sick anymore
I'm sick of meetings
I'm sick of studying
Tell Tom you're sick
I'm sick of hospitals
Tom must've been sick
You make me sick, Tom
You're making me sick
I'm sick of this place
You're sick, aren't you?
Are you sure you're sick?
Do you think Tom is sick?
Who told you Tom was sick?
Are you still feeling sick?
The smell's making me sick
Why don't you call in sick?
Did you really call in sick?
That'll really make me sick
It's enough to make you sick
That's what's making me sick
Who paid for it?
Is it all paid for?
Do I still get paid?
Tom didn't get paid
What's the pay like?
You'll pay for that
You'll pay for this
Who pays your salary?
Has Tom paid the rent?
I've paid you already
Who paid your tuition?
You've been well paid
I still get paid, right?
You haven't paid me yet
Can Tom pay for all this?
Have you paid your taxes?
How did Tom pay the rent?
You'll pay for this, Tom
Can you pay half the bill?
Do I have to pay you back?
Haven't I paid you enough?
How will you pay for that?
I can't afford to pay you
That's what I pay you for
That's what they paid for
Have you paid the bill yet?
You will pay for this, Tom
Do I need to pay in advance?
How are you going to pay me?
Who's going to pay for that?
Who's going to pay for this?
Why didn't you just pay Tom?
Why don't I pay Tom a visit?
How did Tom pay for all this?
That's what they pay me for
Tom hasn't paid the bill yet
Are you getting paid for this?
Can you pay attention, please?
Have you paid your phone bill?
That's what Tom gets paid for
There's a pay phone over there
We've come to pay our respects
It's already almost ten p.m
It's time for bed
Yes, I believe so
He can only get better!
That's my boy!
You did well, my son
It's outstanding
You're gonna be famous one day
This kid is fuckin' badass!
Well done, son
That was kickass!
He's better than us
She's better than us
I'll take you home in the car
Look at this picture, please
The wall is 27.5 meters long
Let's learn English
What do you need that for?
I can't read the letter
The book isn't new
Take this!
I have a short-sleeved shirt
I'm homeschooled
Did you forget to bring money?
I'll go if the weather's good
Tom's gun misfired
There's a gas leak
Is that the plan?
Do you hate me?
It's impossible for me
I've never told this to anyone
I'll do anything to help
Are you trying to scare me?
I don't have so many skills
OK, how can I help you?
Why is it so quiet here?
Is that all you want to know?
Is that all you want to eat?
How can we contact you?
How can I contact you?
Exactly how does this work?
Can you at least try?
It's impossible to me
It's not funny!
Let's talk soon
Tom probably could've helped
It won't be easy to do that
I won't be home for dinner
Tom would never do that!
We've always done it this way
What are your symptoms?
Do you like gummy bears?
I didn't mean that to happen
I don't know where Mary lives
Have you been busy?
Tom, you look kind of green.
Do I?
Is something wrong?
There's nothing wrong.
He counted to 100
Looks like work's been tough
Tom's gluttony knows no bounds
My wife is so happy!
Tom's missed at work
I'm not about to judge you
How's that possible?
I don't like cheese
Do you think Tom is reliable?
I think Tom wouldn't mind
Do you resent my being here?
What was your other choice?
What do you use this for?
Dammit..
Hey!
I'm going to sue you, King!
For what?!
Dot, dot, dot..?
What now? ..Hey, Edgeworth
Nice to see you.
Likewise.
What brings you here?
What's up with his voice?
Look down.
HELLO.
He texts with his mouth.
Uh-huh.
Let me get my attorney.
Then get me one!
No.
WHAT?!" "...Fine.
Stick 'em up!
This is a robbery!

Tom wants to go, too
Why is he here?
He didn't mind telling me
He'd have done it anyway
What is his job?
What's her job?
What is her job?
How did she get there?
I'm counting on your presence

He's wrapped up in his studies
Don't text and drive
How much did you eat?
This is my best friend, Tom
Do you see a person or a wolf?
A love letter from Gray?

I won't examine you
I'm not here just to look good
Moreover, I can fly
In addition, I can fly
I'll certainly miss him
I'll certainly miss her
I don't want to go back alone
Thank you, anyway
Why do you give him money?
I'm in love with Jean Reno
Where is she working now?
Tom's obviously drunk
Tom's a drunk
Tom's quite drunk
Can you look here please?
What does this even mean?
Don't spread yourself too thin
Be passionate!
How much are the oranges?
What do the oranges cost?

How far did it go?
I'm dreading the exam
He's not special
She's not special
It's not special
I'm leaving town
I'm leaving the city
He's a financial wizard
I'll never part with it
It's time to wind up
Whom do you work for?
What is plausible?
It's a genuine question
It's a social problem
Is it a social problem?
It's a medical service
Have you ever read the Koran?
Jørgen is learning Greek
Mette is Jørgen's wife
You didn't hear anything..
In fact you weren't even here
Okay?
Excuse me, how much is it?
We're meant for each other
He doesn't even know your name
He doesn't even know my name
She doesn't even know my name
He doesn't even notice me
She doesn't even notice me
Put me down, Tom
Is that so much to ask?
Can I have one too?
Thanks, Tom
You're a real friend
I'm very hungry
I won't say it again
Keep practicing, Tom
I don't smoke them
What is philosophy?
Waiter!
Why would he say no?
Why would she say no?
Don't open your mouth!
I'm happy that I am not a man
What will we eat?
Which one would you take?
He is the teacher's pet
How high is this mountain?
I like to sleep-in on weekends
I don't like who you've become
Don't forget your phone
Is Tom going to die?
My mother knows Tom's mother
Tom, what are you saying?
Do I look like your maid?
An RPG where you cut cookies?
How silly is that?
Hear!
Hear!
Do you wonder that?
Okay then.

I've done this too
I've done the same thing, too
Are you still in the office?
Are you still at the office?
You need a haircut, Tom
Tom, you need a haircut
Hey man!
I'm overdressed
I hope I'm not overdressed
I'm going to kill Tom!
What were you two up to?
What are you two up to?
How could you be so stupid?
Are you still afraid?
I don't remember well
Is this your first convention?
Tom thinks I'm stupid
That's a stupid policy
It's your own stupid fault
Are you really that stupid?
We've made a stupid mistake
I think that's a stupid idea
I know that Tom isn't stupid
You're making a stupid mistake
Tom didn't want to look stupid
Don't wander from the subject
I'm getting bad vibes from him
What did you write?
You don't know the truth
Do you love your children?
I've been stung by a hornet
Tom has a dancer's body
Mary has a dancer's body
Where's Tom?
I don't know
I can't find him.
Please don't drive so fast
Tom is playing with Mary's cat
What are the neighbors doing?
Why did you tell her that?
Why did you tell him that?
I'm sorry
You shouldn't call him that
You shouldn't call her that
I don't know why I said that
I'm sorry for what I said
Why were you spying on them?
I wasn't spying.
Why are you so scared?
It's just a movie
She's rude and selfish
Promise you won't be mad at me
Tom has low self-esteem
Mary has low self-esteem
You're in love, aren't you?
Where do I sit?
Here, sit down
Can you sit up?
Let's sit tight
Go on, sit down
Come, sit by me
Can we sit here?
Shall we sit here?
Shall we sit down?
That's where I sit
Let's sit up front
Just sit down, Tom
Can I sit with Tom?
You can't sit there
Come, sit on my lap
Can I sit there?
Who was sitting here?
Let's sit over there
Do you mind if I sit?
You'd better sit down
Sit back down, please
I can't just sit here
Come sit with us, Tom
Come sit with me, Tom
Can I sit on your lap?
Can I sit next to Tom?
Tom couldn't sit still
Is this where Tom sits?
Why are we sitting here?
What are you sitting on?
Tom, sit down right now
Why don't we go sit down?
Could you sit over there?
Can we at least sit down?
Why don't we all sit down?
I can sit anywhere, right?
Do you mind if I sit down?
You're sitting in my chair
You'd better sit down, Tom
Would you mind if I sit in?
Would you like to sit down?
Would you care to sit down?
Where am I supposed to sit?

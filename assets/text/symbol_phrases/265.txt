It's too expensive
Can you help him?

I'm thinking of buying a house
I'm taking an umbrella with me
I'm ready to go, but Tom isn't
I'm not sure what Tom is doing
I'm just learning how to drive
I'm going to a concert tonight
I'm a little under the weather
I'll probably see you tomorrow

I'd like to stay home tonight
I'd like to send this airmail
I'd like orange juice, please

I've got to brush my teeth
I'm not waiting any longer
I'm going to eat some cake
I'd recommend taking a bus
I'd like to buy a used car

I'm getting by
I'll go by bus
I do that, too
Is this spicy?
I can't relax
I'm well now
Who paid?
That's wet
I'm happy there
Mozart died in 1791
Who's going to eat all that?
But, what do you do there?
Have you always lived here?
Are you crazy?
You're gonna get killed!
It was Sami's blood
Sami doesn't remember Layla
Sami is my first-born son
Why did Sami convert to Islam?
Layla hopped on Sami's bike
Tom is having fun, right?
Tom is having fun, isn't he?
I didn't expect you to help
Do you know Sami?
Sami was well-mannered
Sami is Layla's new boyfriend
Let's dance.
No, thank you.
Come on, just a few steps.
Why is Sami dressed like that?
Mary's sighing
Can plants talk?
Now you're exaggerating
That's bonkers
That's daft
What do you think?
It's alright now
If you come, I'll also go!
Caution!
Fragile!
You needn't count on me
Who told you all this?
You're surprisingly sensitive
Do you want to see something?
Sponges are filter-feeders
Will you invite me inside?
I'll text you
I saw him hold Mary's hand
I hope he's not her boyfriend
I've got my hands full
Did she invite you to dinner?
Did he invite you to dinner?
Should I go out with him?
What's wrong?
Uh, nothing.
So how was your date?
She's something else
He's something else
Who said I had a date?
I'm not mad
I'm just disappointed
Your T-shirt's inside out
How was your date?
Horrible.
Do you mind if I take a look?
How was your date with Tom?
It wasn't a date.
I've got my hands full here
I'll lay the table
Tom's dog licked his face
It's good that you were there
Don't let Tom sleep
The streets were chock-a-block
I need the loo!
Tom, you're as thin as a rake
I'm in Spain right now
It is three o'clock right now
Will you be here on Wednesday?
When do you get up on Sundays?
When do you got to sleep?
Are they all in Spain?
How old are they?
He eats at twelve o'clock
Did you do something fun?
Wait for it...here it comes
What could you say?
Do you drink?
Never.
That's the way Sami wants it
Fuck him.
Shut up, racist motherfucker!
Fuck off!
Fuck off!
Say that again, asshole?
I'll be expecting you
What can I say?
And my broadband won't work
Quickly!
It's hard to breathe
I'm glad you brought it up
Don't leave the toilet seat up
We're inviting you
He's the oldest
She didn't argue
He didn't argue
Tom didn't argue
I'm the youngest
Shouldn't we invite him too?
What about Tom?
Shouldn't we invite him too?
What about Mary?
Shouldn't we invite her too?
Shouldn't we invite Tom, too?
I'll do what I've gotta do
You're fat, terrible, ugly,..
Do you want me to go on?
Sami is ruining Layla's life
Sami can't take chances
You're under arrest.
For what?
For the murder of Sami Bakir.
Sami's life was very ordinary
He's probably just scared
She's probably just scared
Don't be naive
He doesn't care about you
I know what you're thinking.
What am I thinking?
Work smarter, not harder
You don't know who's out there
Sami didn't get caught
Sami's luck ran out
Sami's eyes were swollen shut
Sami's day turned to horror
I've got a question for Sami
Sami disposed of Layla's body
For Sami, life goes on
Is Sami still out there?
Sami doesn't want to be on TV
Sami didn't stop for lunch
Don't wait for tomorrow
Do it now, not later
A man walks into a bar..
Tom's study faces the backyard
This shirt's got to be ironed
Do you see that fox?
See that fox?
The room's nice
I've changed my plans
They'll do anything to win
They haven't told us anything
They didn't tell us anything
I'm really glad I did it
Tom's job is very stressful
Mary's job is very stressful
You go first, then
Let's bury the hatchet
Could you hand me a towel?
You probably shouldn't do this
We probably shouldn't do this
Mary's face reddened
What a cheek!
Don't mess everything up!
Do you have your own flat?
What's so special about him?
What's so special about her?
What is Tom trying to prove?
I'm so excited to be here
What are you most scared of?
You're heartless
Tom has a 9-to-5 job
Do you love your husband?
You're my only love
What do I love most?
Are you seeing my husband?
Sami shouldn't be doing that
Sami doesn't deserve that
You're doing it wrong again
You've hit me
You're going to jail
I didn't hit you
How dare you hit me?
Sami's life was in danger

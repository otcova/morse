It's your decision entirely
It's entirely your decision
How big is this screen?
Tom's got magical powers
Mary's buying a new percolator
That's not quite my style
It's not quite my style
Come and see us more often!
Can you pass me that book?
Let's hope our team is ready
Palestinians won't surrender
That's not a threat
It's a warning
Yanni shared Skura's video
It's good to see Yanni again
Don't get me wrong, Yanni
Welcome to Algiers, Yanni
Skura loves Nuja's earrings
Yanni loved Skura's necklace
I'm Yanni, by the way.
Nice to meet you.
Skura's husband just died
Where did you get the watch?
Where did you get the watch?
I stole it.
Hi, I'm Yanni
Yanni read Skrua's resume
That's what Yanni means
Please to meet you, Yanni
Yanni can't let this happen
Yanni doesn't believe Skura
I'll see you in Algiers
Yanni knew, didn't he?
That's Yanni's business
I owe you one, Yanni
Breakfast is on me, Yanni
When does the flight leave?
When does Yanni leave?
Yanni's car has leather seats
Yanni saw Skura's car
Yanni can't come along
That works for me, too
Yanni's van exploded
That's a Kabyle accent
Happy?
Sure!
What's Yanni eating?
Yanni drove Skura's van
What the hell is Yanni doing?
Here's your coffee, Yanni
Will Yanni stop in Boumerdes.
This is really nice, Yanni
The break is over, Yanni
Yanni's eye started to twitch
Yanni won't stop
Yanni can't stop
Yanni can't stop now
Yanni doesn't want this
We've got time on our hands
Where did Yanni do that?
When did Yanni do that?
How is Yanni going to go home?
Yanni isn't rich at all
I'm Yanni and this is Skura
Yanni's cookies are delicious
Yanni broke Skura's heart
It's not gonna work out
Yanni got a job in Algiers.
Yanni doesn't want anything
Yanni won't have a nickel
Yanni won't have a penny
Yanni won't have a dime
Yanni needs Skura's cash
Yanni doesn't believe it
Yanni's r's sound like l's
Yanni can't resist
I wouldn't mess with Yanni
I'm getting out of here, Yanni
Yanni says he's bored
Who's the fool now?
Let's settle this outside
That isn't a horse
It's a donkey
Yanni sat on Skura's lap
Yanni.
Excuse me, do I know you?
Don't let Yanni fool you
Yanni doesn't mess with that
How was school today, Yanni?
Where are people's manners?
Where did Yanni get that?
Yanni can't go to that game
Yanni doesn't feel well
Is that you, Yanni?
Yanni says he's seeing double
Yanni was singing Skura's song
Yanni hasn't seen Skura either
Who's there?
It's Yanni.
Yanni says he's Muslim
Yanni hasn't been baptized
Yanni's father is in jail
What does the Lord say?
Does the Lord say that, too?
Yanni didn't touch anything
Yanni isn't going to hell
Yanni's dad was sent to prison
Yanni's nickname is "Dido.
What is all this screaming?
Yanni's parents have a point
Yanni didn't have a choice
Yanni ruined Skura's life
We missed you, Yanni
Forty dollars?
Make it a hundred.
OK.
Let's keep this friendly
What was Yanni thinking?
What's the score, Yanni?
Yanni in jail.
Here's your money, Yanni
What's Yanni's favorite band?
Is Yanni coming with us?
What's so funny, Yanni?
Yanni is my neighbor's stepson
I'll see you around, Yanni
See you around, Yanni
Oh yes, thank you!
Yanni's kids were released
That was really nice, Yanni
Why did you marry me, Yanni?
Is "F" a Greek letter?
Δ" is a Greek letter
How do you say "owl" in Greek?
Is she Russian?
Are they Russian?
I'm not afraid of Russians
She's a Russian beauty
Are they Russian?
Yes.
Are you Russian?
Yes.
Do you like Russian food?
Do you like Russian cuisine?
What on earth is an adjunct?
Speak Russian correctly!
Russian isn't spoken here
It shouldn't bother Tom
That's our castle
We're Greeks
I'd like you to go
Don’t do it Garfielf
Garfield, you lazy cat
I’m hungry
Grub time!
Where are the 3-cheese pizzas?
Where are the taco shells?
On Monday, we went to the pool
We don't like our neighbors
That's not so hard, is it?
What is this cacophony?
I didn't make my meaning clear
That isn't what we had in mind
What are your expectations?
Enough, Link
We must get shitfaced.
Great!
I'll grab the booze.
We'll do our best to stop it
You killed me!
Good.
(He waves the magic wand.)
Cool!
How do I look now?
You look like a queer.
Great!
Could you keep it down?
I'm trying to be boring
Tom didn't do that for long
Can you hear the music?
No, I am your father
You've never heard of soap?
I literally don't know, okay?
I stand corrected.
Tom doesn't exist
Tom saw Mary's face
Hey, everyone!
Got that?
No breathing in class!
You always lie!
You're smart.
Okay, you sometimes lie.
We've done this all our lives
That isn't all that happened
That isn't easy
Tom wasn't wearing his boots
That isn't what I have to buy
Could you keep it down?
I'm trying to study
Could you please be quiet?
I'm trying to study
I'm a vegetarian!
I didn't feel comfortable
We've done our best
We don't like doing this
We don't like doing that
We don't enjoy doing this
Tom saw Mary's reaction
I wonder whether it'll snow
I wonder if it'll snow
Stupid questions don't exist.
I take back what I said.
Well, well
Okay... good..
That's just dark
That's deep, man
That's deep
That isn't helping
Do you like Kazan?
I'm from Siberia
August has thirty-one days
Tom didn't give Mary a reason
Where's my pancake?
I'm from Switzerland
I'm from Mexico City
I'm from Moscow
I'm from Zimbabwe
I'm from Berlin
I'm from Paris
I'm from Madrid
I'm from Prague
I'm from Kurdistan
I'm from another city
I'm from a different city
What city are you from?
I'm from Rome.
We hope this time it'll work
That's not the truth!
Palestinians aren't terrorists
Palestinians aren't aliens
Palestinians are human, too
Palestinians won't forget
Kabyles!
It's in Kabylia
Kabyles, write in Kabyle
I'm a Kabyle citizen
In Kabylia, Kabyle is spoken
What's it called in Kabyle?
What's this called in Kabyle?
That isn't what I need to buy
Yanni's skin was ghostly pale
Yanni's wife suddenly died
I wasn't at school that day
Let's see if Tom can do it
Tom didn't like Mary's dog
Well, that’s just super
That isn't at all funny
We've done our part
Why is Yanni crying?
Yanni hasn't met Skura yet
Does Yanni have any family?
Why is Yanni so skinny?
Do you see that?
Yanni is Skura's father
Where does Yanni go to school?
Algiers?
Yanni doesn't eat carbs
Yanni doesn't eat potatoes
Yanni doesn't drink soda
Yanni doesn't smoke
Yanni doesn't have cable
Where does Yanni sleep?
Is Yanni's car nearby?
Is Yanni nearby?
Is this Yanni's apartment?
What does Yanni sleep?
Yanni hates Skura's parents
Yanni's true name is Ziri
We're going to sell our car
What is Yanni doing here?
Do I know this Yanni?
Where does Yanni live?
Where should we pick Yanni up?
Yanni is Skura's destiny
Yanni was at Skura's place
Don't thank me
What time can we expect Yanni?
Yanni can't come today
Yanni isn't ashamed
Yanni is open-minded
Yanni can't find his loofah
Yanni took Skura's loofah
Yanni used Skura's loofah
Yanni ruined Skura's loofah
Yanni uses Skura's loofah
Yanni's cousin is from Algiers
Who's the young man?
That's Yanni.
How's Yanni?
Yanni is a friend of Skura's
Yanni won't even talk to Skura
Yanni doesn't know who he is
Yanni follows Skura's rules
Yanni loves Skura's kids
Yanni knows who's boss
Is that Yanni?
How's Algiers?
What's Yanni trying to say?
What can Yanni do?
Is this Yanni?
Yanni loves Skura's car
Yanni loves Skrua's new car
Yanni won't believe that
Yanni can't believe that
Yanni isn't serious
Yanni isn't crazy
Be cool, Yanni
Don't embarrass me, Yanni
What are you and Yanni doing?
Yanni's job is classified
Yanni is a mama's boy
Who would say that?
Yanni.
Yanni's mother save his life
That feels good, Yanni
Do you mind if I sat with you?
Is Yanni on drugs?
Yanni got Skura a T-shirt
Yanni's father never told him
Yanni was very, very sick
You saved my life?
Yes, my dear.
Bless you!
Is that true, Yanni?
Tom wasn't being honest
Yanni was about Skura's age
Yanni did save Skura's life
Yanni won't go to the concert
Is that what Yanni wants?
Yanni isn't a mama's boy
How does it feel, Yanni?
Yanni's last name is Ziri
Yanni says it's important
Yanni's mom got a heart attack
Yanni's test came back normal
I'll find me a new wife
It was Yanni's fault
He's OK
Please leave me alone!
Yanni is painting Skura's room
Yanni doesn't know what it is
Yanni is Skura's new guy
That isn't a secret
Why was Yanni pulled over?
Yanni can't do this
Yanni can't live like this
Palestinians don't feel safe
It's not easy to fool Tom
Yanni's dad passed in 2004
Yanni's idea is terrible
I'm Skura
Don't do that, Yanni
Yanni doesn't want any of that
Yanni played with Ziri's toys
Yanni found Skura's hamster
Yanni found Skura's turtle
He's the groom
I'm true to my wife
Is Yanni a friend of yours?
Yanni likes Skura's friends
Yanni doesn't call that theft
Who was that?
Yanni.
Yanni stole Skura's heart
Yanni is new to Skura's school
What does Yanni like?
How dare you, Yanni?
We're closing, Yanni
Yanni is family.
No, he's not.
Is Yanni right?
Yanni won't do that
Here he comes.
Who?
Yanni.
Yanni took Skura's purse
Yanni stole his mom's purse
Tom didn't consult us
That isn't helpful
I'm not gay; I'm bi
I'm bi, not gay
I'm queer
Hi, Satan!
Yanni shouldn't mess with that
Yanni doesn't worry
Yanni's cab is late
Yanni remembers Skura's name
I'll see you later, Yanni
Don't trust Tom
He's a cop
Yanni's eyes are twitching
Don't touch Yanni's stuff
Wear a mask, Tom
We're dead
That's not Tom
It's a ghost
That's not how that works
That's not how anything works
Yanni was texting a co-worker
Yanni is Skura's office spouse
Did it work for Yanni?
Yanni isn't OK
Yanni didn't threaten anyone
Yanni shouldn't go there
Yanni checked Skura's emails
It's in Yanni's brain
Yanni has feelings, you know
Yanni has needs, you know
Yanni felt that, too
Yanni has that feeling, too
Yanni doesn't have kids
What justifies that?
Yanni couldn't find the term
This isn't necessarily bad
Is Yanni seeking approval?
Is Yanni seeking acceptance?
Yanni knows that, you know
Tom didn't wash Mary's car
We'll be on our way now
Tom didn't bring his phone
That isn't important right now
I'm afraid of my wife
How do you know my wife?
You remind me of my ex-wife
That's not the point here
Does anything really exist?
Is anything real?
Uh-huh, suuuuure
I'm going to the place
Does anyone know the answer?
Really?
No one knows the answer?
Really?
I didn't know that
Did I do any damage to it?
Tom didn't see anyone moving
The window doesn't open
I'm opening the window
Did I hurt it?
That isn't why I did that
That hasn't been made yet
Isn’t it sad?
He can’t dance, poor tomato
But he can’t dance
We're painting our garage
That isn't our problem now
That isn't love
Come on, Karen!
Just wear the mask already!
You'll never catch me, copper!
It's not who you think
Let's paint the wagon
Did that make sense?
I don't think that's French
I don't think that's Yiddish
It's fine; it's just voseo
Thou speakest sooth.
That is absolutely stunning!
What's your favorite idea?
I'm a human
That's a lot of pages!
It's a lot of ads.
That isn't the system
Tom wasn't able to handle it
He doesn't know how to relax
She doesn't know how to relax
That's a bad opinion
Good night!
How can your cat tweet?
That isn't my goal
We've finished our work
That isn't my bike
Tom didn't go to work today
We've both hurt our ankles
This show is so self-aware!
Tom saw Mary's car
Tom has been invited, too
How did you do on the test?
That isn't the dog Tom wants
That isn't a word I'd ever use
I didn't see Tom last night
That isn't a bad guess
We didn't have our shoes on
Let's discuss it later
That isn't even an issue
What did you see then?
Buy now, pay later
I'll order it later
I'll order this later
I'm yawning because I'm tired
I'll speak with Tom later
That isn't a good idea
Tom didn't trust Mary one bit
That isn't a mistake
We aren't like Tom and Mary
We won't waste your time
That isn't good at all
That isn't very close
Tom didn't try to help Mary
That isn't very polite
In the sea, waves are heaving
You find that amusing?
Hurrah!
Huzzah!
I'm always wary of such people
We're wary of them
That isn't the main issue
That isn't the only problem
Tom didn't give Mary any money
That isn't smart
We'll make our stand here
That isn't acceptable to me
That isn't a cat
That's a dog
How did you know Tom?
Ah, it's a long story.
Let's hope we get to do that
Tom wasn't accepted yet
I've just seen your post
Tom still hasn't been accepted
Tom couldn't have heard that
He's read every Thor comic
Tom didn't tell us anything
Is the airport far?
They're at the airport
Mary's at the airport
We're going to the airport
Which airport are you at?
You're at the airport
We're at the airport
I'm not going to the airport
I won't go to the airport
That isn't why you're here
Tom didn't know it
How would Tom know that?
What country is New Mexico in?
You'd better hope nobody comes
What's your French class like?
Help!
My phone is smarter than me!
Do you want me to invite you?
What are your cats' names?
What's new?
I wish I could say the same.
We've painted the door green
That book's funny
Tom whispers in Mary's ear
I didn't feel great
Tom didn't really like us
Tom was invited, too
It's raining hard now
Look at the size of that!
I don't need it
I don't need it
I definitely don't need it
I definitely don't need that
We'll give it our best shot
That isn't something I need
That's not something I need
That isn't entirely correct
I'm not going to hide
Where is Samuel?
Okay, okay, I'm going now
I'm going to scold you!
Tom didn't really say much
She's not photogenic
That isn't why I do this
That's not too much, is it?
We're doing our duty
Tom took his T-shirt off
That isn't normal
We're washing our hands
That isn't my call
That isn't all Tom wanted
Tom didn't do anything at all
That isn't what we have to do
I didn't say you were stupid
That isn't a pencil
It's a pen
That's not fun
That isn't why Tom wants that
Tom didn't know us
Tom wasn't wearing his glasses
That shouldn't bother Tom
We've spent all our money
I'll visit Tom some other time
You're never right
I'm not going to bite you
I didn't know that then
That isn't too hard
Tom didn't take his medication
That's not my intention
That's not true, is it?
That isn't what I've heard
That's not Tom's real accent
We're going to lose our jobs
That isn't original
Do you like olive oil?
We could've lost our jobs
You can't see Tom
It's fun to ski
Today, I was at work with Tom
Tom wasn't used to that
That isn't good enough for you
That isn't so long
Tom didn't say he'd do that
That isn't advisable
We didn't do that on our own
The heart doesn't lie
Trust your heart!
That isn't unusual, is it?
What broke your heart?
She's got a heart of stone
I would like to see Mr. Kosugi
You can't build anything here
Don't take it so personally
It's just a game
Do you know HTML?
Do you know her last name?
Do you know your name?
Do you know this manga?
Do you know his address?
Do you know her address?
You know we're here
You know that we're here
Do you know where he is now?
Do you know where she is now?
Do you know who lives here?
What French words do you know?
What German words do you know?
They've got a large apartment
Hello, my name is Maite
We didn't wash our hands
Get up, Tom
Could you change me?
That's a one-way street
We're playing in that park
That doesn't relate to me!
Is this from France?
He's a Chinese citizen
We're from Columbia
We didn't keep our promises
That isn't important
That isn't documented anywhere
I'll be back by seven or eight
Could you give me some change?
She wasn't looking for you
Tom wasn't the one who shot me
I hope you're wrong about that
That isn't so
That isn't completely accurate
We didn't finish our dinner
That isn't so hard, is it?
Tom didn't offer Mary a ride
That'll happen soon
At least, I sure hope it does
We're on our way to see Tom
Tom didn't write anything down
Tom didn't know what that was
That isn't a choice you have
Tom didn't stop to help
That's not the intent
That isn't my intent
I didn't want to miss that
That isn't where I have to go
We didn't take our shoes off
That isn't unusual
That isn't very romantic
It's got to be done right away
Tom saw the gun in Mary's hand
Will there be life on Mars?
Two o'clock came
I'm sorry, sir
We're here to get our dog
I can't make him stay
I can't make her stay
I can't make you stay
Tom didn't eat his soup
I don't know his motives
I don't know her motives
Wow, that was amazi—" "I know.
We're enjoying our time here
Tom saw blood on Mary's hands
That's not wine
It's just grape juice
Tom didn't move to Boston
Tom wasn't far away
That isn't hard to do
Does Tom still love his wife?
Tom didn't turn any lights on
Tom and Mary haven't seen this
We're really good at our jobs
Tom said he didn't see anyone
That isn't why I like Tom
It was too good!
You amuse me!
Enter, Juan
Do you eat fried eggs?
That isn't for you
That's not too hard
Tom didn't want to invite Mary
Who goes here?
I actually don't know yet
Why did you insult me?
That's not why I love Tom
We haven't made up our minds
That isn't even an option
Tom didn't give the badge back
Where's the lid?
What did he do with you?
She's very tall!
Is she really there?
Where's the box?
We're sticking with our plan
Tom said he hadn't seen anyone
That isn't a very funny story
We're on our lunch break
We'll never change our minds
That isn't surprising at all
Don't argue with Yanni
Don't even try, Yanni
Yanni doesn't have time
Yanni is so good-looking
Yanni knows that, Skura
Yanni's room is up there
What do you take Yanni for?
This is Yanni's mother
Where are your manners, Skura?
Are you hungry, Yanni?
Yanni's dad is an electrician
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
Yanni is an electrician.
Isn't that nice?
An electrician.
Stop thinking, Yanni
Stop talking, Yanni
Stop doing that, Yanni
Yanni isn't getting my message
Yanni was a mama's boy
Yanni doesn't understand it
I'll see you here later, Yanni
Is everything OK, Yanni?
Everything is fine, Yanni
That's not good for Yanni
Where were you?
And where were you?
Yanni isn't running for office
Do I make myself clear, Yanni?
What time is it, Yanni?
Is this the library?
How did the test go?
Yanni wouldn't worry
Goodnight, Yanni
Good luck, Yanni
Yanni doesn't mind doing that
Take him to Yanni, Skura
Did Yanni see that happen?
Are you OK, Yanni?
Is Yanni mad?
Sometimes, it frightens me
Yanni wasn't very good
Yanni doesn't know about this
Yanni shouldn't worry
Yanni's table is clean
Yanni liked Skura's story
Do it again, Yanni
Tom didn't notice the changes
We've got plans of our own
Is German easy to learn?
That isn't going to be easy
We can't do this on our own
We'll send you our bill
That isn't very original
You don’t have the guts!
That isn't very fair, is it?
We're very proud of our son
We're locked out of our room
That isn't realistic
Tom saw that, too
We're considering our options
We'll do it our own way
Tom didn't do his job
We've finished our homework
Tom didn't tell us his surname
Tom saw Mary's lips move
We like our son-in-law
Don't do a half-assed job
Whoa, are you serious?
Woah, are you serious?
That isn't a real secret
Can't I do it tomorrow?
We've finished all our work
Did someone ask you something?
Rocío is improving her Turkish
That isn't why I took it
I'm full of bites
Tom didn't elaborate on that
Give my book back, please!
Let's hope Tom will be there
Tom wasn't helping us
We're looking at our options
We don't usually do that here
That isn't my idea
We're on our way to work
We've kept our promise
Meet your new roommate!
Shut up and be quiet!
It's nice to meet you!
I don't speak English.
But you said that in English.
That's all I know how to say
Strike three!
You're out!
I'm alive because I live
Okay, that was bad timing
You've just made a big mistake
Why do I keep doing that?
Why do you keep doing that?
Why does Tom keep doing that?
I'm confused
We like our daughter-in-law
Are you sorry?
Are you guys sorry?
That sounds like a threat.
That's not necessary, is it?
We don't change the world
How did you know I'm German?
I already miss you!
But I haven't even left yet!
Is this the meaning of life?
To be there for someone?
It's just a joke.
I don't see how Tom can win
That isn't working
Sensual" is not "sexual.
You know—the five senses
That isn't what that means
Tom's living in the past
Is the train delayed?
I can't find my tie
What does your company make?
Bricks.
Do you know where it is, Tom?
Oh, I ate it not long ago
I thought it was for me.
That isn't hard
Tom wasn't mad at all
How fast can a rowing boat go?
Where can I charge my mobile?
We've done that all our lives
Tom was very young in 2013
I can't see Tom either
That isn't a bad decision
We're on our way now
I've never seen Tom in jeans
Tom didn't want the present
That's not exactly my plan
We didn't take our shirts off
Where are you from?
I'm from Algiers, why?
Yanni wants to eat couscous.
Couscous?
What's that?
What's for lunch?
Couscous.
I'm vegetarian.
You can eat it without meat.
Yanni doesn't eat couscous
Is Yanni from Algiers, too?
That isn't bad
Is this milk?
Mary's drinking milk
What's his name?
Yanni.
Yanni?
It's such an unusual name.
That isn't a question
Tom wasn't allowed in
We're living with our uncle
Why is milk white?
Did you drink milk today?
Tom didn't do as he was told
That isn't important to Tom
That isn't important now
We’ll be there tomorrow
Tom wasn't allowed to see Mary
We've talked about it before
That isn't the deal
That isn't what I asked you
We'll see what Tom wants
We can't find our jackets
Tom was in the A&E
Tom was in the A&E department
Tom didn't show up that night
That isn't a solution
It's too expensive for me
That isn't what I wrote
Do you speak Esperanto?
Let's see if you can do it
You're very dejected
That isn't how we think
That isn't what I'm here for
They don't realise the danger
We've lost our jobs
Where is the nearest bathroom?
Don't duplicate sentences
I can't buy a new bike
You'll have a new sister
I wasn't able to do it
Did you already hear about it?
Tom didn't come to our party
They're hypothetical data
Tom wasn't in the library
I called my Senator's office
That isn't illegal
Tom didn't offer me anything
Tom didn't ask why
That isn't what I was thinking
That isn't very nice of you
This isn't exactly what I want
Tom didn't ring the bell
Don't come dressed like a bum
That isn't completely wrong
That's not Tom's, is it?
Ahh!
What was that, Mommy?
Don't be scared
It's just the wind.
That isn't a museum
We'll get there on our own
Here's an idea
That isn't my thing
That isn't healthy
Tom didn't lock his doors
I don't think this is French
That isn't half bad
Tom doesn't trust Mary one bit
Is everything OK in there?
Is your office near here?
Was that necessary?
Yanni wasn't directly informed
The Bible doesn't say so.
Yanni's goat was grazing
This dish doesn't hold water
No one likes you!
Why is Tom so heartless?
She's ugly
Don't let Tom spoil your life
I haven't checked myself
Don't marry Tom
I'm kidding, buddy, calm down
I'm overdue
Soon I'll be speaking Korean
Can I stop eating this bread?
They didn't sing
We don't know, Your Excellency
Spend less, smile more
I don't like chocolate
He's calling you
Tom won't hurt us anymore
She didn't answer me anymore
She's not in
Mary's not at home
Mary's not in
Have you gone abroad?
Your hat is nice!
It's unseasonably warm
She was at the doctor's today
How many days till New Year?
We hope he'll get well soon
I'm glad you remembered me
No one.
We've got to move house
Where are you all?
Tom's son is pulling faces
You've got to write something
How about we go watch a movie?
You're you
If only!
You're just asking for trouble
That's just asking for trouble
Is it bad that I like this?
But what will be tomorrow?
The beginning or the end?
Where's Yanni?
We ate him.
Glory to God!
Yanni's gums were bleeding
Forgive me.

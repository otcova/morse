Mary looks like she's homeless
Mary looks like she's hesitant
Mary looks as if she's in pain
Mary isn't wearing her glasses
Mary isn't used to her new job
Mary isn't sure if she's right
Mary isn't here
Mary isn't as bad as she looks
Mary is staying at her uncle's
Mary is playing with her yo-yo
Mary is in her office, working
Mary is hoping she'll be hired
Mary is afraid that she'll die
Mary hasn't yet sold her house
Mary hasn't sold her house yet
Mary hasn't learned her lesson
Mary dyed her old T-shirt blue
Mary doesn't keep her promises
Mary does what's right for her
Mary didn't tell me her secret
Mary didn't take off her shoes
Mary didn't take her shoes off
Mary didn't let me in her room
Mary didn't give her real name
Mary didn't do this by herself
Mary couldn't restrain herself
Mary couldn't put her socks on
Mary couldn't make up her mind
Mary couldn't keep her balance
Mary couldn't find her glasses
Mary couldn't believe her luck
Mary couldn't believe her eyes
Mary couldn't believe her ears
Mary can't walk on her own yet
Mary can't keep her mouth shut
Mary can't get her car started
Mary admitted she'd lied to me
Mary admitted she'd been wrong
Mary admitted she wasn't ready
Mary admitted she wasn't brave
Mary wouldn't let us help her

Could you translate for me?
Turn the radio up, please
Tom is a non-smoker
Are these events connected?
What's Mary's dog called?
Tom didn't see the street sign
Tom didn't see the road sign
What's that thing there?
Is what he's telling us true?
Mary is very single-minded
That's no reason to be sad
She's a late riser
Tom isn't a good coach, is he?
Are you coming?
Are you coming?
Are you coming?
He's rather a home bird
He's something of a home bird
They're hungry this morning
The course doesn't end today
But who is the author?
Stop, stop!
You're Mr Miller?
Pleased to meet you!
The waste-paper basket is full
30 years have gone by
It was in the year 1989
We've just watched a film
We've just seen a film
Do you recall that?
This isn't the newest of bikes
Yanni whispered Skura's name
Let's sing a song in French
Let's sing a French song
Tom isn't always early, is he?
I'm going to be up all night
You're a soldier, Tom
Tom isn't already here, is he?
Tom isn't used to that, is he?
Tom isn't in Australia, is he?
Tom isn't sleeping now, is he?
Can I help you do something?
I'm in Berber class again
It was so easy to be happy!
Women don't like creeps
I'm going to do what I can
I'm spiraling in the void
Don't you have class now?
I couldn't see what it was
Stopping prohibited!
Tom isn't eating lunch, is he?
I'm going out tonight!
I'm lit!
Tom isn't over thirty, is he?
We're hurt
Keep yappin', man
Tom wasn't on the pier
Don't jump yet
Tom wouldn't tell me about it
Mary wouldn't tell me about it
Tom isn't still scared, is he?
They don't need to be here
Who will row?
Tom isn't going to win, is he?
Tom got promoted.
We're faster than you guys
Tom isn't following us, is he?
Tom's door is never locked
That mutt bit me!
Tom isn't an alcoholic, is he?
I'm going out tonight
I'll be going out tonight
I won't be going out tonight
I didn't go out last night
Don't laugh yet
Tom isn't taking a nap, is he?
I'm going to have to change
Tom isn't watching TV, is he?
I've forgotten to register
Who's teaching you English?
Mrs Yamada.
Tom isn't a good skier, is he?
Tom isn't an architect, is he?
Does she drink coffee?
I'm not leaving any time soon
Tom isn't helping Mary, is he?
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy
The Lord gave, the Lord took
I don't know it here
I'm not from here
Does this hairstyle suit me?
I feel alone, you know
Tom isn't back in jail, is he?
We're an Algerian family
That's all we need to know
When will Yanni be in Algiers?
Where has he parked his truck?
Have you been up a long time?
Yanni is from Bejaia, Algeria
Tom isn't the youngest, is he?
Sorry, I have to run
We're drunk
You aren't the chosen ones
Tom isn't your nephew, is he?
Tom isn't studying now, is he?
I'm currently living in Moscow
How do I become a cat?
Tom isn't still in bed, is he?
It doesn't matter in this case
Yanni didn't hear Skura flush
Have some more chicken.
I'm full, thanks.
Have some more chicken.
No, thanks.
Are you full?
Yes.
Tom isn't still upset, is he?
Is this too short?
Tom isn't good at math, is he?
Everyone says they're innocent
I see the boy's mother
A little work won't hurt you
He's Acadian
You've just seen him
You've just seen it
There's fish
There's some fish
Our money's being spent
The film wasn't that great
The movie wasn't that great
Pleased to meet you, ma'am!
Load the cannons!
They weren't sure of it
He's still a minor
I've gotten much better
I can't stand your father
Have you found your book?
We've amassed a fortune
What a shame you couldn't come
I'm going to Paris next Friday
Thomas, go wash your face
Give me a piece, please
Tom's given me something
Tom's leaning on his elbows
I'm having trouble reading it
I can't read it very well
You haven't opened your mouth
It's sad to forget a friend
Tom isn't already back, is he?
We didn't need to see that
We won't go
I'll talk it over with Tom
Tom isn't drinking tea, is he?
We're poets
Will you give me a sip?
Look, you need to calm down
Tom isn't wearing blue, is he?
Is Tom really worried?
We're thirsty
Next week, he'll be in Chicago
May I close the door?
I'll be in Boston Monday night
May I smoke in here?
Do you think I'm scary?
Tom isn't a typical teenager
Mary's dress was cheap
You'll need your ID cards
Did you put oil in the pan?
Why were you screaming?
Why were you shouting?
What's on Tom's plate?
We'll stay
Tom isn't in the park, is he?
We don't eat meat
That's all I really needed
Tom isn't your teacher, is he?
Tom isn't making lunch, is he?
Tom isn't in the attic, is he?
Yanni can't live in Algiers
We're nurses
It didn't need to be this way
Tom isn't still eating, is he?
I'm in Algiers.
Who cares?
Yanni's Berber is really poor
Tom isn't wearing red, is he?
Tom can't see anything
Tom isn't still afraid, is he?
We're deaf
It's illegible
I don't know where to hide
I don't think he's happy
Tom isn't a vegetarian, is he?
Why are you always depressed?
Don't be a people pleaser
We're rested
I can't share this with you
Yanni didn't know Berber
Why aren't you scared?
I can handle myself.
Tom isn't on the list, is he?
Yanni's phone started ringing
Yanni said Skura wasn't there
The man didn't say anything
Yanni didn't answer the call
Yanni doesn't know that man
Yanni's neighbor came home
Yanni's legs began to tremble
Yanni wasn't in the car
Yanni's headlights were on
Yanni is outside Skura's door
Tom isn't on vacation, is he?
What's the temperature here?
What time does the sun set?
I don't drive anywhere anymore
Tom isn't good at that, is he?
You're scared of death
Tom isn't exaggerating, is he?
Were you invited, too?
I read Tom's poems
Did you read them, too?
Get out of my life!
How should I know!
Could you call back later?
Then do it yourself!
Please don't touch the fruit!
I'm concerned about her safety
How long do you want to live?
I can't help her
Is Trump dead yet?
My father is busy, as always
The elevator won't move
Can we hang out?
We'll talk it over
It seemed strange to me, too
Did Tom ask you?
Do you hear that, too?
If you do it, I'll do it, too
Do you love me, too?
I can't sew
Let Tom come, too
We can do this tomorrow, too
Tom got Mary's attention
Can you see it, too?
Tom's phone is new
Do you remember the Y2K bug?
Don't worry about me!
Christ has risen!
He won't forgive himself
We're pitchers
I can't buy a new car
That's when Yanni freaked out
Yanni never, ever left Algeria
We're homicide detectives
I'll go home soon
We're good cooks
Will Tom do it, too?
We're a little apprehensive
Tom shouldn't do it
Why are you here in Paris?
We're parents now
Who's Yanni?
Skura is a 24 year old female
Yanni's house is very rundown
Yanni's house is unlivable
Yanni's hay is gray
We're taxi drivers, too
We don't know those men
We're therapists
Let's have Tom do it
Of course I love you!
We're patriots
You're pulling my chain
Tom didn't want Mary to be sad
Mary didn't want Tom to be sad
We're mature adults
Tom stole Mary's phone
We're pretty good skaters
Is it OK if I go, too?
If you need anything, I'm here
Tom's door is always locked
We're bartenders
I want the room back.
What are they doing?
How should I know?
Don't they ever get tired?
Apparently not.
It didn't impress them
That's more than I dared dream
They're greeting the guests
They're welcoming the guests
She's too quick
How many more stops?
I'm leaving again
No, we haven't
No, we haven't
No, it's not
We chucked it when we moved.
No chance!
It's his fault!
He's repaired them all
He's mended them all
You're very careless
Do you have a fountain pen?
Have you got a fountain pen?
How many pens have you got?
How many biros have you got?
How many biros do you have?
There's no loo roll left
There's no loo paper left
We've still got some loo roll
We've still got some loo paper
What's in the drawer?
What is in the drawer?
They're like chalk and cheese
This was built 500 years ago
It's just pure coincidence
We've failed
Did you like it there?
Yanni cat-sitted for Skura
I'm tired of it all
He didn't answer yet
She didn't answer yet
Can I have an apple?
Yanni was there, peering in
They didn't answer yet
We're juniors
Tom tried to grab Mary's arm
Tom's parents are very old
Dementia ran in Yanni's family
I told Tom I'd do it
Why is this necessary at all?
Could you forgive me?
Yanni's body was dug up
All right then!
Algeria is Yanni's homeland
Do you like cats, too?
We're stumped
Use the opportunity!
Who has objections?
Is your wife coming, too?
We're careful drivers
Do you know French, too?
Do you think so, too?
Don't give it to Tom yet
Did you find it strange, too?
I don't have my stuff.
The police couldn't find Tom
Tom will do it, too
We're Capricorns
It hurts me, too
I can't betray Tom
We're dog trainers
Did Tom do it for you?
Don't you like it here?
I'd better get some sleep
Great job, Tom
I can't do without this
We're graduate students
The mask hid Tom's face
The mask hid Mary's face
Let me use it, too
I'll report the error
Can I have an apple, too?
We've won
Is it too short?
Who lives with you?
We were Tom's mentors
We're mechanics
I miss you, baby
Did you think so, too?
That isn't what I did
I think I'll have a drink
Tom doesn't visit Mary anymore
We're a bit old-fashioned
I'm going to join Tom
I bet Tom won't do it
We're good shots
Yanni looked around wild-eyed
Was I invited, too?
The garage door wasn't locked
We're plumbers
We're stamp collectors
I'm a civil servant
We're terrible singers
Stop that!
Don't you see he's scared?
Yanni's house was locked up
Yanni's house is dark and cold
We're ministers
Do you guys live here?
Yes, we don
Why?
We're handymen
Yanni's house was pitch black
We're good drivers
Where is the shopping area?
We're a bit short on cash
We're reporters
I should've refused
I'm sure that this isn't Tom
Even you, Brutus?
We're simple men
We're veterans
We're a little crazy
We're members
I didn't let Tom in
Why did Tom get divorced?
When did Tom get divorced?
We're fighters
Tom's got roid rage
Is the spoon small?
Tom's life is a sitcom
Tom's life is a reality show
Yanni's bus will be here soon
We're law students
Tom's got road rage
We're cab drivers
We're happy men
We're fast walkers
Tom crashed into Mary's car
We're crusaders
I could be wrong, too
I'm French and she's American
I've finished showering
We're married men
I said, shut up!
We're problem solvers
Are you right-handed?
Are you toying with me, Stef?
Are you playing with me, Stef?
What does Tom plan to do?
It's ten past one
He's wearing a bathing suit
Close that curtain!
Apologies, I'm very sad
I didn't see Stefan
Where are they walking to?
We're pediatricians
We're not liars
I'm going to go to Boston next
We're very careful people
I like Tom's pictures
I'm the organist
I thought it was Tom's turn
We're photographers
I'm an inspector
Tom isn't good at golf, is he?
In a group, we are strong
We're social workers
Don't think about the past
We're hopeless romantics
We're a little taller than you
We're rich men
I'm sure I can defeat Tom
I think I've got an idea
What did Tom plan to do?
We're lousy cooks
It'll be colder tomorrow
When was this tree planted?
They've gotten lazy
I'll meet you back at the car
We'll meet you back at the car
Time travel isn't possible
A ball hit Tom's right leg
The ball hit Tom's right leg
I wish I'd married Mary
Did you have any problems?
Are you having any problems?
Any problems?
Yanni's accent sounded Kabyle
I'm French and he's American
Can you come over?
Not tonight.
Yanni's alarm bells went off
Yanni's car had a flat tire
You want another one?
Don't fawn over him!
Will the noise ever end?
It's as good as new
I'm back!
It's Tony
Daniël thanked the policeman
I don't like French cuisine
I'm just a little boy
They still don't understand
He's strong and brave
I've got to go on a diet
It's really nothing new
Shut up and listen to him!
I don't eat apples anymore
Where's my phone?
It's on the dresser!
How often does Tom snore?
Every night!
I'm totally desperate
How often does Tom snore?
Every night!
I'm at my wit's end
What if I want to?
We've got a cat
Why didn't she say anything?
Will you pick me up?
I can scarcely believe it!
It's for the best
I'd better watch out then
Donald Trump's a piece of shit
The man is just play-acting
How should I go about it?
It's more purple than blue
No peeking!
How can I get through this?
Do not touch!
No touching!
How dare he!
Could you please just hurry?
Get going!
How come you're not done yet?
It's from desperation
I've eaten like a pig
Drink water!
This doesn't depend on me
Can you call me a cab?
I've turned into a robot
She'll never forget that day
She'll never forget this day
We're bachelors
You're Mr Miller?
That's me
Pleased to meet you!
The pleasure is all yours.
I think it's a terrible thing
That's a French word
She's a good singer
I'm going in the lift
I'm going to take the lift
He's a walking encyclopedia
He's clicking his tongue
We've all got our troubles
It's a bit worrying
It's a bit alarming
Let's have a bit more light
You can't see anything here
We're fugitives
It's easy to miss the junction
I'll tell Tom everything
I've run a bath
Won't you just open the door?
Just open the door!
I'm going to take my chances
I'm sure that I can defeat Tom
We've got less snow than usual
That'll do me good
We're translators
Tom, go wash your face
I'm losing my temper
We're foreigners
That isn't what I do
That isn't what I want to do
We're all cheerleaders
We're lousy singers
We're sculptors
I'd like Tom to stay with us
We're good swimmers
What should Tom do about Mary?
I'm tying my shoes
We're policemen
Will Tom ever do this?
We're light sleepers
I want to eat, too
We're terrible swimmers
What hopelessness!
We're truckers
I hope you die!
They're beautiful memories
My turn!
it's my turn!
Turn off the stove!
We're bloggers
What did Tom ask Mary to buy?
We're beekeepers
We're lousy swimmers
I'm a radiologist
We're school teachers
I don't know what Tom means
We're very shy people
Racism is a serious issue?
We're bank clerks
One false move and you're dead
We're widowers
Can Tom do it for Mary?
We're secretaries
I'm better today
We're very busy people
Spring is finally here!
Spring has finally arrived!
You're in trouble!
It's made out of pure cotton
No, that can't be true
No, that cannot be true
I'm not taking this!
You're quite shameless
You're great!
You are great!
It's cold out
We'll teach Tom some manners
Forgive each other!
My darling!
My love!
My precious!
My dear!
Do people live here?
He's blackmailing you
I didn't see you fall
He stayed at his aunt's
We're studying
He's friendly towards me
You're bullshitting me
You're full of it
Now it's all gone to shit
If you dare!
What an acrobat!
Wait here until I'm back
He's independent
He's got no pride
He hasn't got any pride
He's discouraged
I'm her friend
Don't brake so suddenly
What?
It's already eight o'clock?
God!
Time flies when I play chess!
What?
It's already eight o'clock?
God!
We're unarmed
It seems they're having fun
Don't cry outside
Is there grass on that road?
May I please see your licence?
May I please see your license?
Do you have a pen for me?
Have you got a pen for me?
I'm trying to do my job
I'm up for that
He'll do the dishes
Is that tasty?
Don't drink a lot of wine!
Do not drink a lot of wine!
Speak up, I can't hear well
Ah, Superintendent Chalmers!
That was Tom's boat
The cat's stuck in the tree
I'm glad to hear you
Climb up slowly, Tom!
They're babbling
Are you alright?
Yes, I am.
Summer's about to end
I hope Tom doesn't come back
Where can I put the bike?
Where can I put my bike?
The train's here
Slow down or you'll get a fine
We're all music majors
Nature's balance is fragile
This can't go on like this
This can't go on like this
Be quiet!
Quiet!
Tom's thinking
What is even going on?
Father, I have sinned
About to fish, he goes
How is your day going?
Lord, have mercy!
I got you!
We're runners
Did Tom say he'd do it?
So disgusting!
Books are entertaining!
Look on the bright side!
We're cheerleaders
We're a lot happier now
Did you help Tom do it?
We're magicians
Did Tom really do this?
We're government workers
I can't run as fast as Tom can
We're biologists
Will Tom do it for us?
Is Tom really married?
We're very lucky men
Who's the idiot who did this?
We're good guys
We're house painters
Why can't Tom do this?
We're financial experts
Tom won't be invited
Who'll do it now?
Who's going to do that now?
We're housewives
We're a lot like you
I'm sure that this isn't Tom's
We're a little tired today
We're retired
I'm not ticklish
We're up next
We're a bit disorientated
We're coaches
Tom didn't answer Mary's texts
Today, Tom is cooking
Yanni wasn't actually Algerian
We're refugees
I'll drop by tonight
I'm one one to hold a grudge
We're witnesses
We're liberals
We're a little busy now
Why did Tom do that to Mary?
We're a bit shy
I'll be like that someday
Yanni can't return to work
Yanni's brother was napping
We're a little worried
Yanni's garage door was closed
Yanni didn't move a muscle
Yanni remembers Skura's smile
I'm with him at the door
Who's the idiot who did that?
What idiot did that?
I think about ten dollars.
We're race car drivers
You guys don't need to die
She doesn't read
He's smart but poor
Will she like it?
We're all looking for them
Neptune was Jupiter's brother
There's room for everyone
We're all Brazilians
You're a sensational person
Can we do this tomorrow?
We're realists
Is your name Smith?
We can't do anything
Will he like it?
Tom won't do it today
I think it's a piece of cake
It's time to eat something
Could I have a coffee?
Put your back into it!
Spare the rod, spoil the child
We're big fans of yours
It's bone dry in Death Valley
How do you make holy water?
I'm done with my schoolwork
I can't eat rice
We're a bit anxious
We're tour guides
I'm still a bit woozy
We're adopted
Honestly, you look like an ass
We're pretty good swimmers
Look at this mess!
It's too loud I can't hear you
I'm building a house
Yanni watered Skura's flowers
Yanni's parents called him
Yanni shouldn't have friends
We're beginners
Yanni shook Skura's hand
Yanni's stomach twisted
Yanni doesn't have a roommate
Yanni is Skura's ex-boyfriend
I think I'll apply
From which wilaya?
I don't know
We're quick learners
We're a bit nervous right now
Tom didn't seem tired to me
Stop talking!
We're a little behind schedule
His problem is that he's lazy
We're both from Tampa
Good, thank you
And you?
Who broke your heart?
Do you see a horse or a wolf?
How many baskets does he have?
We're football players
They're a perfect couple
Check, please!
This bridge isn't big
We're visitors
I've never denied it
We're members here
We're fussy eaters
I'm glad that no one died
We're lousy dancers
We're beginners, too
We're serious people
We're gym teachers
Tom isn't always like that
Tom wasn't excited about it
We're a little busy
Maybe, I should stay here
There's no reason to stay
If you get sick, stay home
If you're sick, stay home
If you want to stay, that's OK
It's better if I stay home
I don't like staying in hotels
We're salesmen
For now, we have to stay
You can't stay up too late
Tom didn't answer Mary's calls
We're bankers
We're non-smokers
I don't need the details
We're bad students
We're a little out of practice
I don't feel my age
We're very lucky people
This is God's plan
Was her name Skura?
How did you know that?
Yanni's jaw dropped
We're potters
I'm a cyclist
I'm still working for Tom
My dog’s legs started to give
It's irrelevant.
Can I have your number?
Why?
Can I have your number?
I don't really text a lot.
Can I have your number?
We're gymnasts
You're mine
Are you heading to work now?
I don't need advice
We're drifters
We're creatures of habit
Tom is Mary's opponent
We're Harvard graduates
We're seniors
We're teenagers
It was already 3 a.m
I'm sure this isn't Tom
Congratulations, Russians!
Benefitting who?
We're health nuts
She wasn't wailing anymore..
Where can I hide?
I'm cleaning the house
Do you hear it?
I'm sure that someone hid it
They're protestants
Did you upload the video?
We're new students
Look, it's stopped raining
We're stuntmen
I'm starting to hate Tom
So how did it get there?
We're waiters
I'll do as agreed
Do we tell him?
We're late risers
I'll leave a note for Tom
Who hid it?
Do you know what to look for?
Do you know where to look?
We're volleyball players
We're a little tired
I haven't seen her around here
I'm well aware of it
It doesn't sound good
I'll need someone to help me
We're a bit freaked out
I'm not proud of myself
We're cat people
There's no one apart from you
He's twenty years old
Please wait for me!
He's a teacher at our school
I'll buy three pillows
Fortunately, he didn't die
We'll meet here tomorrow
We're surgeons
We're yodelers
I'll contact my bank
We're psychiatrists
We're tennis players
I know you're very busy
We're a little skeptical
They've come to kill me
We're not shy
Where did he kill them?
We're geologists
What did Tom ask Mary?
We're bad golfers
Tom's motorcycle is noisy
Tom knew he'd never call Mary
It's cold out there
If they go, I will, too
May I have a look?
We're a bit worried
Tom's house is near a river
Tom's house is by the river
I'll fight to the death
Didn't you like it there?
Say what's in your heart
When will Tom do it?
I don't need it yet
I don't need you yet
Do you like it here, too?
We're teachers, too
We'll use it
The movie was over at 4:00 pm
Now you're exaggerating a bit
Yanni's dad is coming soon
Yanni hated Skura's boyfriend
Mary's dress was a cheap one
Yanni is Skura's ex
Has he given a reason?
Did he give a reason?
He's easily distracted
It's best if you don't smoke
Hello?
Is that Yanni?
Yes, Skura, it's me.
Yanni..
Hello?
Is that Yanni?
Yes, Skura, it's me.
Yanni..
I'm sorry..
Dad didn't make it
It's just a façade
It's just a sham
It's just a pretence
We're consultants
Bring your parents, as well
He's on the loo all day
There's a bit of milk left
She's gathering nuts
She's just as old as he is
She's watering the flowers
What's that rumbling?
I hear you're a doctor now
I think I'm good at driving
I'll watch a documentary
If I were you, I'd ask Tom
Here's one of my pictures
Yanni begged Skura to call 911
Yanni attended Skura's funeral
I'd rather do this later
Hello.
Yeah, who's that?
We're fast eaters
Couldn't Tom do this?
Tom's parents lived in Boston
Mary's lived in Chicago
Can I come with you, too?
Yanni didn't speak in Berber
I'd like to go to Gaborone
Where did you learn it?
I hope Tom doesn't come
I'm busy, as always
I'll eat later
Do you want to learn French?
I'm already learning it.
Have a great week, my friends!
They don't like this
They're in the store
It'll be a while!
I'll go with you to her house
We're hunters
Tom's business is underwater
No can do!
He's lying through his teeth
Don't knock it till you try it
Tom hasn't the faintest clue
Don't you want to play?
Do you not want to play?
Don't you like ice cream?
Do you not like ice cream?
Borat" is a mockumentary
Thy will be done, not mine
I won't eat cake
Why won't Tom do it?
No one is good, except God
Tom couldn't wait to meet Mary
Why don't we go to the park?
We're writers
I can't come this week
What are you eating?
I'll order the same thing

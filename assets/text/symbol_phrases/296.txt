Betrayed, not conquered
What were you reading?
I'm telling you your dream
Can we talk about it tomorrow?
Maybe he didn't hear you
Maybe she didn't hear you
How will it be done?
Why are you laughing alone?
What business is it of yours?
I'll do that; take care.
You take care as well.
Because you're mean.
Tom hung on Mary's every word
Eight days from now.
Where is your brother?
He just went home.
What's he doing there?
Getting food for us.
Why do you need food now?
It's for a late lunch.
No.
Why not?
How are we gluttons?
I've got some unpleasant news
How is he deceiving him?
I'll text you later
How do you know the day?
My father wrote to me himself.
How about joining us?

You're killing it
Don't switch the subject
Tom's here, right?
Tom's here, isn't he?
Tom is here, right?
That's the right thing to do
Tom had a five o'clock shadow
I don't like smiling
I'm looking for an ATM
I'm looking for a cashpoint
I'm looking for a cash machine
Upsy-daisy!
Mary's mouth went dry
Mary's heart fluttered
That's what mothers are for
That's what brothers are for
That's what sisters are for
Tom can't stay mad for long
Why did you leave early?
How is it going?
Do you still trust her?
Do you still trust him?
What job did you do for her?
I often read to her.
I had to stay at home.
What for?
How old are you?
Why do you want to know?
How?
I will lend you money in turn.
What else did you do for him?
How money do you have?
Not as much.
How much then?
One penny.
Will you lend it to me?
I need it?
For what?
To buy paper.
I will give it back today.
Get used to it.
You give me good advice.
As you would give me.
So what then?
Why are you laughing at me?
I think it's time I went home
I can't sleep now
But wait!
Didn't you do anything else?
Come on, you're pulling my leg
Can I be of help at all?
Can you hear me well enough?

We're growing
We didn't worry
Where's your cat?
Tom isn't insane
Where's your son?
That's a nice car
Why does she think I did that?

I'm sorry for being so stupid
Tom's computer froze
Tom sprung to Mary's defense
Mary's eyes flashed angrily
Tom's eyes flashed angrily

Please don't freak out
Promise you won't freak out
I'm learning Arabic
I'm determined to learn
Do you have another solution?
What do you fear the most?

I've never won anything
These are Tom's boots

Checkers?
Chess?
Once upon a time..
I don't like playing baseball
Sami kissed the Hajar al-Aswad
You can't beat entropy, Tom
It's a lost cause
Don't make that a habit
Are those your daughters?
I couldn't hear anything
Why do you want a horse?
Why do you want my help?
Why don't you just try it?
What were you doing today?
What was Tom doing today?
Thank you for your answer!
He won't need money
Tom couldn't help but notice
Mary couldn't help but notice
Tom liked Mary's story
Tom stole Mary's money
I'll do all of the talking
Tom won't inherit much
Tom won't remember you
Tom's window was open
We'll have a lot of help
We'll need a lot of help
Where are your daughters?
Where are your grandsons?
Where are your umbrellas?
Where's your grandfather?
Why did Tom accuse you?
Why did Tom have to go?
It's easy to get lost
It's a minor problem
It's not a major problem
It's not a serious error
It isn't a major problem
It isn't a serious error
It isn't a serious mistake
It's not a serious mistake
Where's your grandmother?
Why did Tom need to go?
Why did you need a knife?
Why do you need a hammer?
Tom couldn't be stopped
Why do you want all that?
Tom didn't want trouble
Why do you want all this?
Tom doesn't like sports
Were you at work?
I'm waiting for his answer
I'm waiting for her answer
We're coming!
How did she get that?
I'll take my chances with him
Is it necessary?
You don't have to
How can I help it?
Thanks, but I'll pass
We're heading up north
How do I know which one?
Did you tell him yet?
What keeps you motivated?
It's a rather elegant system
I'm Kabyle
How much time did it take up?
We're waiting on you
Hang in there!
Where should I get started?
That's the focal point
It's about five
It's about five o'clock
Here's my ticket
She didn't like it one bit
Tom didn't like it one bit
I don't want to look weak
We're not geniuses either
Why did you need a hammer?
Why do you want all these?
All of my ex-wives hate me
I didn't cheat on the test
Who is knocking at my door?
I didn't remember anything
I don't want to play chess
Tom's apartment is tiny
I've rung the bell already
Why did Tom ask me that?
We don't care what happens
Why did Tom ask us that?
Do you like literature?
Why did you believe Tom?
Where's your granddaughter?
Why does Tom need to go?

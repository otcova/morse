He's not a girl
She is a girl and I'm a boy
He even called me "ugly
I'm going to say everything
Where are my crisps?
Where are my potato chips?
I'm feeling gassy
We're having a picnic tomorrow
There's a piece missing
He's doing better
Why isn't she sleeping?
We'll meet him tomorrow
Today I'm paying
It's hard to be honest
It's far away
Didn't you notice?
We don't understand
We don't understand it
That coat's mine, not Tom's
That's what I call smart
Did you ask Tom the reason?
Are we on the right road?
It's about time for bed
It's almost time to eat
Sami married Dr. Layla Bakir
Tom's not home right now
Such extravagance!
Release the hounds!
We've reason to be afraid
It's water
Don't try to guilt-trip me
I'll put it on my calendar
She's sitting on a gold mine
I'll have the frog legs
I'll have one frog leg to go
There's a lot more to learn
You've paid too much
Is this pencil not yours?
Aging doesn't cost anything
Don't throw rocks!
I haven't even packed yet
Where are your shoes?
Which of us runs faster?
No you didn't.
Sami didn't know where to go
Sami needed Layla's support
Sami died in June, 2006
Sami isn't taking any visitors
Sami didn't press charges
Sami looked at Layla's tattoo
Sami wasn't entirely isolated
Sami shouldn't be drinking
Sami was only 26
Sami wasn't driving
Sami's odd behavior persisted
Sami was upset, too
Sami doesn't deserve this
Sami didn't treat Layla well
I'm the only one that did that
I'm the only one who does that
Tom was very, very lucky
I'm too old to do that anymore
Tom was wrong, wasn't he?
Tom was serious, wasn't he?
I'm very sure I should do that
Tom was unlucky, wasn't he?
Tom was unfriendly, wasn't he?
Tom's eyesight isn't very good
Tom was very late, wasn't he?

Tom said he'd be willing to go
Sami's body was found
What helps with a cough?
Do you want a T-shirt?
We'll get there soon
There's no traffic jam
What helps cure a cough?
Tell him, asshole!
Tell her, asshole!
What you said isn't true
I'm trying to study
I'm trying to study
There's no relief?
You like music, don't you?
We'll meet Tom tomorrow
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
We've blown a fuse
This hat isn't new
Sami's mother has passed away
Sami checked Layla's room
Sami couldn't bathe himself
Sami couldn't feed himself
Sami couldn't handle it
Sami found Layla's ring
Sami can't lift this box
Sami's needs escalated
Sami and Layla's eyes met
Sami didn't see that coming
Sami can't stay there
Sami found Layla's shotgun
Sami story doesn't ring true
Sami didn't miss
Sami can't manage this
Sami's birthday has passed
Sami was released in 2006
Sami didn't see it coming
Sami's heart hit the floor
Did you understand?
I'd rather not eat out tonight
I'd rather not sing
I'd rather not give a speech
Tom's wife is about my age
You don't have to be so cold
Sami's testimony was powerful
Sami doesn't doubt that
Sami didn't challenge that
It's in the microwave
Sami didn't want that baby
Sami's alibi wasn't airtight
Come in, please
Sami's defense strategy worked
I've started keeping a journal
Sami left Farid's cult
Did you visit any museums?
How is your foot healing?
I'm getting a blister
That's pretty good pizza
How about some pizza?
It's been paid in full
Do we tip here?
Sami is 36 years old
Should I tip?
Sami's life was in shambles
Sami wasn't certain
What happened to my new cap?
Sami didn't say that to Layla
I'm craving fruit
What happened two pages ago?
Sami inspected Layla's car
Sami's story checked out
Sami left Layla's car there
Sami didn't want to go
Sami broke into Layla's house
Sami got rid of Layla's body
Sami married Layla in 1976
Sami was cross-dressing
Sami was a cross-dresser
Sami didn't expect to see that
Sami didn't mean to do it
Sami didn't witness the crime
Sami didn't even have a car
Some things don't change
Sami was money-hungry mechanic
Sami was a double-amputee
Sami doesn't want to miss this
Sami's demons have taken over
Why is the ocean blue?
Sami cleaned Layla's engine
Sami's theory was questioned
Sami paid that 160 dollars
Sami's wife is Asian
Sami didn't test this product
Sami stole Layla's purse
Why wouldn't he?
Sami's house collapsed
Sami's ship sank in a storm
He's a great guy
Sami's leg had to be amputated
Sami's plane crashed
I'm going to make coffee
Sami's skin began to peel off
Sami fell 26 storeys
Sami weighed 46 kilos
Sami's ship capsized
What happened last night?
Nothing.
Tom couldn't hide his smile
Mary couldn't hide her smile
Sami had stroke-like symptoms
Sami can't prove it
Sami trained Layla's poneys
Sami began his shift at 6 pm
Sami didn't just attract Layla
Sami maintains he's innocent
Sami was super-intelligent
Sami still mourns Layla's loss
Ten stars spicy!
Sami didn't touch Layla's body
Sami shouldn't be fooled
What a weird earth!
Mary's hairdresser is Dutch
Sami didn't know that himself
Sami couldn't do it
Sami weighed 160 pounds
Sami killed Layla's husband
Sami didn't make that comment
Sami wasn't interested in that
Sami couldn't have the kids
Sami wasn't a truthful person
Sami discovered Layla's body
Sami can't go in that bedroom
What did I just drink?
Have a good day, hon
I don't
Does that make it an issue?
What is he writing?
Let's forget I said anything
Do you like the opera?
Do you listen to classical?
I don't know, Tom
We'll try another time
There's a lot to learn
Don't create dust!
Don't throw dirt clods!
It's not really practical
It's this year's new model
I don't like the styling
He's a refusenik
He's stubborn
The lovers walked arm-in-arm
It's too slow
OK, let's take a break
So you're one of those people
You think you're so smart..
He's a playwright
Why do I write?
When do you stop thinking?
They won't let me in
It's all said and down
It's mostly manual labor
Tom remodeled Mary's home
She'll pick it up at noon
Is it too soon to swing by?
I'm banned from the theater
I'm a big deal around here
What's on your playlist?
Well, it's about time
Is there someone following me?
Did you find out who?
Why are you pestering me?
Is there nothing better to do?
Well, that settles it
There's no law against it
Don't leave us alone here
We're not taking charity cases
How is the tea?
Gee willikers!
He's dying of lung cancer
Why is this such a big deal?
Let's stop and rest
Don't fart so much
Why not get some sleep?
Let's drive to Vegas
He's a prophet
What shall I bring?
Here's how I see it
I can't stop crying
We're all behind you
Can this be eaten raw?
This fork isn't clean
Come on!
You can do it!
How did you manage this?
Is it OK to eat this raw?
Let's do this again soon
I asked Tom if he'd do that
Are you sure that's right?
I'm having a senior moment
That's still up in the air
Is that really what Tom said?
Could you check this for me?
Do you really have to leave?
How long will you be at Tom's?
I asked Tom if he'd done that
I bet Tom he couldn't do that
I've convinced Tom to do that
I hear you're very talented
Can you stay a little longer?
I asked Tom why he'd done that
I assured Tom that I'd do that
It's not worth talking about
Let's go get a cup of coffee
How can you be so insensitive?
How hard can it be to do that?
How long do you want to sleep?
What're we supposed to do now?
I can do that for you, I think
I hear you're a good violinist
I'm not the best person to ask
That's not what I meant at all
I'm a colleague of Tom's
Hold on!
I'm coming!
Our train leaves at 2:30
Sami's house erupted in flames
Sami doubled Layla's salary

Tom, go rake the leaves
This won't be good
I haven't practiced today

Don't give the dog any
It's none of her business
That'll teach 'em
She's agitated
I'm getting hungry again
I wasn't so busy today
I've hurt myself again
I did that without Tom's help
I wasn't much busier than Tom
Tom couldn't wait to see Mary
I purposely didn't do that
I wasn't ready to leave
I didn't permit Tom to do that
I wasn't as careful as Tom was
I didn't do that in 2013
I wasn't as nervous as Tom was
I don't enjoy being here
I've known Tom for a few years
Tom doesn't even know I'm here
I wasn't enjoying myself
I wasn't very busy today
I wasn't willing to help
Let's relax a little bit
I don't expect to be paid
I wasn't as busy as usual
I wasn't eager to do that
I've injured myself again
What do you think she'll say?
Why didn't they know?
Where is Tom's paperwork?
Was that really gluten free?
Don't steal honey from bees!
How do you use this?
Won't you be lonely?
Hello, my treasure
It's a treasure
Snowy is Tintin's dog
It's getting dark
Let's set up the camp
Do you want to see my kitten?
Do you want a cup of milk?
Could I have a glass of milk?
Oh, I forgot to buy milk
Where were you, Tom?
Tom can't move his right arm
Tom can't change anything
Tom finally arrived at 2:30
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
We shouldn't help Tom anymore
We shouldn't have helped Tom
That's why he didn't buy it
Tom knows I can't come today
How did Tom guess the answer?
Tom went to Mary's place
Tom is at Mary's
They're playing badminton
I was at Tom's place yesterday
What happened yesterday?
Sami didn't resist arrest

We aren't on the list
Tom didn't do that alone
Was it fun to do that?
Was it fun doing that?
Tom could've been afraid
That's not all we did
Should I study French?
Should I speak French?
Tom can't do that either
Should I go to Boston?
Tom believes that's true
Our ordeal isn't over
My room's a real mess
My name's on the list
Losing isn't much fun
Let's reconsider that
Tom and I aren't related
Let's not do that now
Tom and I aren't married
Tom and I aren't enemies
It's really very easy
It's a very good idea
Is it safe to do that?
Is it easy to do that?
Is it OK if I do that?
Is doing that illegal?
I've worked in Boston
I've done that enough

How come you did that?
Don't speak so loudly
Tom's office is next to Mary's
Do you work in Boston?
Do you read the Bible?
Tom won't do that without Mary
Do you know that lady?
Did you pass the test?
Did you know about it?
Did you bring the key?
Are you really hungry?
Your voice isn't bad
Tom doesn't seem hungry
Tom doesn't like winter
You've helped us all

You're a good artist
Tom could've been tired
You're a fast runner
You're a born leader

You don't smile much
Tom and I weren't alone
You did that in 2013
Why will you do that?
Why go to Boston now?
Whose jacket is this?
Whose cats are these?
Who's that gentleman?
Tom should tell Mary he's busy
Who's in the kitchen?
Who's doing that now?
Who should I contact?
Who needs to do that?
Who brought the cake?
Who bought this food?
Tom and I don't do that

Tom didn't see Mary doing that
Tom speaks French, too
Tom couldn't make Mary do that
Tom should've been mad
Tom and I've helped Mary a lot
Mary and Alice are Tom's aunts
Let's try to do that
I thought Tom didn't like Mary
Let's buy some roses
I thought Tom didn't know Mary
It's wise to do that
It's too hot in here
I know Tom's in love with Mary

I've quit doing that
Tom said he'd be there
I've often done that
I've been doing that

I've already ordered
I'm too weak to work
I'm the team manager
I'm the only witness

I know it's his call
Tom doesn't think Mary is shy
Tom didn't think Mary was shy
Tom didn't know Mary did that
Tom doesn't like pizza
Tom did that, but Mary didn't

Will you sing today?
Why did that matter?
Tom said Mary didn't do that
Whose candy is this?
Who wants ice cream?
Who drank my coffee?
Who chose this gift?
Who broke the swing?
Where can I do that?
Tom must've been cold
When do you do that?
We'll leave at 2:30

My French isn't bad
Tom and I are Mary's cousins
May I do that today?
Do you know how Tom met Mary?
Let's switch places
Let's go downstairs
Tom's answer surprised Mary
Let's do that today

Is doing that legal?

Here's the solution
Don't lose this key
Doing that's my job
Tom must've seen Mary there
Do you teach French?
Didn't anybody come?
Tom still isn't here
You're a weird guy
You're a tough kid
You're a tough guy
Tom forged Mary's signature
You're a smart kid

I've been forgiven
I'm really unhappy
I'm not an athlete
I'm getting drowsy
I'm all rested now
Tom said Mary isn't scared
I'm afraid of mice

I can't stand rap
I can't cook well
How late were you?
Did you draw this?
Tom got up at 6:30
Tom doesn't gamble
Who spoke French?
When did you eat?
Is this your bag?
I'm still afraid

I'll do that now
Tom said Mary isn't mad
Tom and I'll be OK
I do as I'm told

Where can I sit?
Tom's dog is cute
Tom won't be here
They're reading
It's impressive

Can I wait here?
We'll buy that
Tom said he's shy
May I buy that?
Tom and I'll help Mary
I wasn't tired
Tom isn't my boss
I didn't reply
Can I buy that?
Nobody's here
I'm skeptical
Has Tom forgiven Mary?
They're lazy
I can't come
Don't eat it
Do you drive?
Who drove?
There's a storm brewing
Did he survive the fall?
When do you think he'll stop?
That's probably not the case
Is that how it is?
You're reading it wrong
Can anyone corroborate?
Strength isn't everything
You wanna throw down?
Go ahead, see if I care
It's not strictly necessary
You'd better get used to it
Let's walk around the pond
There's a ghost in the mirror
How much money?
Waiter, check please
Where is this road?
Is this a library?
How much are entrance tickets?
Where can you buy this?
Do you have big ones?
Do you have small ones?
Do you have other types?
Where can I take a taxi?
May I use it?

How long were you out?
Are you one of them?
Where are you going next?
Do you like these colors?
I like these colors!
It's a custom job
Queue up!
Can we get there in time?
Is there still a chance?
Does anyone remember that?
Was this ever a thing?
Why is this even a thing?
That's the funny thing
You lucky thing, you
It's the thing to do!
You have to believe!
I'm really interested in it
We have a living-room
I don't feel old
Tom didn't have any money
My dreams don't make sense
You're a big liar
It's too late for that.
I'll text you when I get home
You can't control me
You can't run my life
Why didn't you tell me?
I know we're not rich
What's with the long face?
We're going shopping tomorrow
Do you want me beg?
Do you remember his last name?
I do not need that, Grandpa
We are not afraid of you.
But you should be!
Did you like it here?
Were you staring at my legs?
I'm sorry
I'll pay for the dry cleaning
Is this even legal?
What the devil were you doing?
Do you remember her last name?
If you can't fly, then run
If you can't run, then walk
Has it already arrived to you?
Tom's shirt is wrinkled
Tom wears a clip-on tie
Seriously, Tom
We're just friends
It's an expensive hobby
Mary's locker is next to Tom's
Angels are God's messengers
He confronted unequivocal me!
She was a money-grubber
Can you get me with you?
People don't know own rights
Tom stopped by Mary's house
He tries to rip off us!
How do I get to the museum?
Don't be so hard on her
Don't be so hard on him
Tom went on a fly-fishing trip
Money can't buy taste
Where does money come from?
I'm not sure if this is legal
Is this Chinese or Japanese?
You look terrible!
Mary's gold iPhone looks tacky
The cops are behind us!
What are you up to now?
By Jove!
Ask mom!
I don't think of the past
Yes?
Is this supposed to be a car?
This is a pile of junk!
What is wrong now?
Just another moment!
What's done, is done
They have no self-criticism
You have no self-criticism
I'll try to be home early
I'm not trashy
Do you play football?
No, but I play tennis.
I don't like hurricanes
Do not be so resentful!
Do not be so vindictive!
Do not be so unforgiving!
Do not be so vengeful!
Be a little more clement!
Be a little more lenient!
Be a little more patient!
Be a little more indulgent!
Be a little more forbearing!

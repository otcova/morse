Strike?!
I sure can, butthead!
Enough!

Why?
No!
Screw that.
Go to Gamelon, will you?
No!
Please laugh!
I'm not wearing that dress
I won't go to school tomorrow

Who made up these rules?
Yes, I certainly agree
I'm angry with you
I've already tried

I'm having so much fun
Don't hesitate
What have I got myself into?
Do you have a son named Tom?
He's single.
Who's single?
What?
Did I hear you right?
Oh my God!
He's hiding something
She's hiding something
Tom is going to pay for this!
You're going to pay for this!
Is the computer for me?
Construction began in 2013
It's a really complicated job
Is it "God" or "god"?
Don't be afraid, Tom
There's no need to worry
We're in an open war
Ganon've seized Koridai.
Great!
I'll grab my stuff!
Your sword is enough.
You sure?
Go get your sword.
It doesn't come in my mind
Your Majesty, open the door
I don't care.
It's an X-Wing.
Oh, let me see!
Hmm, looks very nice...
Only I can — fuck!

I am a student, and you?
I won't ask why you want it
I'll have none of it
I'll have none of that
I'm a nerd
I'm a geek
Hello again!
Well, why not?
Mary's not always like that
It's all you can really do
It's impossible to fix
Are you hungry?
No, not really.
You agree with Tom, right?
Mary doesn't drink
You agree with Tom, don't you?
We don't drink
They don't drink
It's really annoying

I'm interested in bouldering
If I were you, I'd buy it.
But you aren't me!
You're the one I need now
I'd suggest you buy it
Why do we have to do it?
Water and oil don't mix
My brother's in Australia now
I'll get there before you
Is this too tight?
Did you find what you needed?
Oh, it's snowing!
She won't stop sobbing
What are my choices?
She won't stop beating me
How long has it been going on?
Are you sleeping with him?

You're different with Tom
It's a good compromise
I don't speak Bengali
I don't speak Albanian

I'll never forget tonight
Would you like a seat?
I'm a real cop
You're not going to shoot me
If anything happens, call me
I'm doing what's necessary

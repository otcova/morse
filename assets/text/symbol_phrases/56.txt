How rude!
I can't believe it
I'll give you a gift
I'll give you ten dollars
How much.
A thousand.
I hope you're talking dinar.
Let me see your hands.
Like you care!
I don't dare to overtake
Don't suppress your feelings
He acts like he's a king
Do you have a new car?
Tom isn't here
He's already gone home
Tom can't leave until tomorrow
Tom's dog was born in October
Tom can't remember what to do
Tom can't stay home all day
Tom can't do it without you
Tom can't take the pressure
Tom can't harm you anymore
One says "Hm!
I wasn't too impressed
Don’t lead me on
I wasn't aware I wasn't loved
You're asking for it
Be quiet or I'll be real mean
Have you changed Tom's nappy?
I'll talk as long as I'll live
I'm your manager
I'm your superior
Don't touch that dress
Let me just talk to them.
Next time, don't get married
We're sick of all the noise
Tom didn't die for that
Tom's died for your sins
Treat me as you've always done
Can you fix me it?
You're making too much noise
I'm trying to watch TV
What's the price tagged on it?
Stop being such a prude!
Don't chicken out
Tom's house is on the market
You've made her cry
You've made him cry
Aren't you going for a walk?
Let's do it!
Are these Tom's pencils?
You're looking beautiful!
We don't want her
Don't insult her
Tomás is self-conscious
She wouldn't stop whining
I haven't heard of it yet
I've heard
So I've heard
How did you learn about it?
Aww, Tom is unbelievably cute
Aww, Mary is unbelievably cute
Do you even skate?
Come on, do a kickflip!
What's the B for?
Berber.
Do we have olive oil?
Take this.
What is it?
We're here on holiday
Tom, you're an utter twat
Every month, I buy a book
I hope Tom doesn't get ill
Do penguins live in Denmark?
We're from Sicily
We've been here a long time
Why are you sad right now?
Why are you sad now?
Tell me where were you born?
Where do you live like that?
Tom met Mary's parents

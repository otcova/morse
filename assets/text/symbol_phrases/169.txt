Was that just my imagination?
Were you waiting just for me?
What a hassle!
What are they doing out here?
What are they doing out there?
What are you doing out of bed?
What are you doing out there?
What are you laughing about?
What are you smiling about?
What did Tom go outside for?
What did Tom just say?
What did we just do?
What did you just do?
What did you just say to me?
What do you guys want?
What do you think I should do?
What do you think will happen?
What do you think's out there?
What does this remind you of?
What should we do?
What was Boston like?
What was that you just did?
What was that you just said?
What was Tom doing out there?
What were you doing out here?
What were you just doing?
What were you just thinking?
What're you two doing?
What's gotten into you anyway?
What's gotten into you lately?
What's this book about?
What's Tom doing out of jail?
When did you get out of jail?
When did you graduate?
When does the concert begin?
When will breakfast be ready?
When will dinner be ready?
When will lunch be ready?
Who do you think I should ask?
Who does Tom remind you of?
Who's Tom arguing with?
Who's your guidance counselor?
Who's your primary physician?
Why are you guys here?
Why did you just say that?
Why didn't you just say no?
Why didn't you just say so?
Why didn't you just say that?
Why didn't you just stay home?
Why do you want to leave?
Why don't we get out of here?
Why don't we go out to eat?
Why don't we go outside?
Why don't we go swimming?
Why not just quit?
Why not just stay?
Why should we do what you ask?
Why should we trust you?
Will you do that for me?
Would you buy this for me?
Would you just get on with it?
Would you just listen?
Would you mind helping me?
I'm not a fangirl
I'm not a fanboy
How drunk were you last night?
You aren't in any danger
You aren't like the other kids
You aren't like the others
You can't do this to Tom
You complain a lot, don't you?
You could've warned me
You don't need to worry
You dye your hair, don't you?
You have a brother, don't you?
You have an assistant, right?
You've exceeded your authority
What do you recommend we do?
You like tennis, don't you?
You never learn, do you?
You ruined everyone's fun
We didn't have much fun
You should be there, too
You should be worried, too
You should leave, Tom
You should probably go, Tom
You should've stayed away
You shouldn't be drinking
You shouldn't be here
You shouldn't have come
You trust me, right?
You won't be allowed to leave
You won't like it here
You won't need a gun
You'd better do as Tom says
You'd better go inside
You'd better go now
You'd better go with Tom
You'd better go without me
You'd better not do that
You'd hire me, wouldn't you?
You'd probably be disappointed
You'll be punished for this
You'll do better next time
You'll do fine, Tom
You'll do no such thing
You'll do nothing of the kind
You'll do what you have to do
You'll have to do it yourself
You'll have to trust me
You'll like it, believe me
You'll never regret this
You're a bad influence on me

You're a good role model, Tom
You're as stubborn as ever
You're as stubborn as Tom
You're awfully quiet today
You're awfully quiet, Tom
You're both awfully quiet
You're bothering us
You're confusing Tom
You're entitled to the truth
You're in a restricted area
You're incredibly naive
You're like a brother to me
You're like a father to me
You're like Tom in many ways
You're not allowed in there
You're not allowed to do that
You're not anything like Tom
You're not as dumb as you look
You're not fooling anyone, Tom
You're not invited to lunch
You're not my boss anymore
You're not scaring me, Tom
You're not supposed to do that
You're not the only woman here
You're not usually like this
You're only deceiving yourself
You're out of toilet paper
You're probably bored stiff
You're probably hungry
You're probably right, Tom
You're really confusing me
You're really scaring me
You're repeating yourself
You're risking your career
You're ruining everything
You're scaring the kids
You're starting to bother me
You're starting to scare me
You're ten minutes late
You're the computer expert
You're the expert here, Tom

You're the one who lied
You're the one who quit
You're the remarkable one
You're the responsible one
You're the strategy expert
You're the weird one
You're totally useless
You're twisting my words
You're twisting the truth
You're very different from us
You're very wise, Tom
You're wasting our time
You're wasting precious time
You're wasting your breath
You're welcome to accompany us
You've betrayed us again
You've betrayed us all
You've brightened my day
You've earned a break
You've earned a good rest
You've earned a rest
You've got to read this
You've got to stop doing that
You've got to study harder
You've had plenty of chances
You've never complained before
You've violated our trust
Why are you so clumsy?
Did you need a laundry basket?

Tom's room is messy
Tom's strategy is working
Tom's strategy isn't working
Tom's stuff is everywhere
You'll find a rake in the shed
We'll bring up the rear
Would you rather come with us?
Why was this news released?
Who represents the defendant?
Tom's speech quieted the crowd
This is third-rate tobacco
That's not quite what I wanted
You'll see I'm right
Quit it!
Let's not quarrel about this
It's rather cold on deck
It's a regular madhouse here
Is this seat reserved?
Is this real silk?
In what respect is that true?
I've been tormented by regret
I'm sure Tom will reform
I'm ready to forgive Tom
I'll try to reason it out
I'll remember you in my will
I'd rather have ice cream
I don't have much ready money
I didn't know you were related
Here's your money
Now we're quits
Have you signed the register?
Have you read your mail yet?
Don't worry
Do you require a deposit?
Do you like your steak rare?
Do you know the real facts?
Do you have many jazz records?
Do you have a radio here?
Can you solve these puzzles?
You've spent time with Marie
What if something went wrong?
I won't leave without you
Party time!
He's not an unreasonable man
He's prideful and arrogant
You're not afraid of me
Do you think there's a hell?
Oh, it's cool
Where will they take us?
She's a fine looking woman
Yes, I can break up with you
What a bad film!
Did you let him kiss you?
Don't be so petty
Do you have any proof?
He's a marine biologist
How could you do this to us?
Do not deny it!
Get my horse ready at once!
Why won't you talk to me, Tom?
Tom has lived here since 2003
Tom hasn't been charged
Is that normal?
I'm addicted to what I do
They don't have to wrap it up
I'm stronger than yesterday
Does it rain there very often?
I don't have much time for TV
How often do you watch TV?
Do you like spicy food?
I love it.
Tom lived from 1963 to 2013
Tom didn't live a long life
How hard is learning to fly?
Why did he buy another car?
Now I've got some time
I'm sure Tom can speak French
Are you nuts or what?
How will I scour with a fork?
Where's the key?
Ah, you have it
Why aren't you going?
Because I don't want.
How dashing!
It's getting beyond a joke!
There's plenty of time
It's my secret garden
When will his wedding be held?
It's a small burg
I'll take care of the horses
There's not much to tell
He's clever and resourceful
Beware of frostbite!
He's manipulating you!
He's not quite satisfied
He's having dinner now
Does your wife know?
There's only one explanation
I've got very bad genes
Construct additional pylons!
There is not enough minerals.
Can he swim?
Sure!
For instance, kaput
He's keen on sports
Don't listen to him, Mary
She wasn't your sister
How often does it rain here?
Unfortunately, I'm late
Alas, I was late
Who's the tallest of the five?
I've had a coffee
Let's play quidditch
Why is it so?
It's snowing on the streets
Thanks for the offer, though
Tom, you're a genius!
There's nothing to be proud of
That's nothing to be proud of
Could you take a photo of me?
I'm a cheerful and nice guy
I don't salute their flag
I don't salute your flag
I'm not training your officers
I don't want to let you go
How much did you get for it?
The result doesn't change
I'm not wiping your tables
Take a chance on me!
Where's the key?
Ah, you found it
He's a typical workhorse
What happened to your leg?
I was skiing and I fell.
Did it hurt when you fell?
You bet.
Where was skiing invented?
Let's go together please
You are so tall!
I don't like this tie
How much does this tie cost?
Did Tom have any enemies?
Did you let Tom kiss you?
Mary is a good-looking woman
Tom is a good-looking man
I've never heard of him before
Who the hell is Tom?
Who is this Tom?
Which way did he go?
Which way did she go?
She's too picky
Okay, you caught me
Tom!
Can I get some privacy?
What are you sorry about?
Let's get dancing
I'll never come
Let's get ready for Saturday
She's a good kisser
They're indecisive
They don't know what they want
You're a teacher
I've had a good time so far
Men are cruel, but Man is kind
What is this treachery?
Are you deaf or stupid?
I won't get in the way
He started it!
She started it!
No, you did!
The prisoners are escaping!
He's very secretive
Are you listening closely?
I didn't want to humiliate you
I don't want him to see it
I don't want her to see it
He's so good looking!
Is there some sort of catch?
There's been a change of plans
He's a good judge of character
Do you like my new clothes?
Tell me what's on your mind
I know how you really feel.
No, you don't!
I know you're in there
Tom!
Answer me!
It's very pretty.
I bought it in Japan.
She's obsessed with books
Did you come here to argue?
Tom didn't want to get married
What has caused this tumult?
I didn't dare to look
Hello all!
Support Tatoeba!
I don't want to mess around
The new album's ready?
Why the hell would he do that?
We're in Italy
What about Portugal?
I didn't know it existed
What about your cousin?
Can she come, too?
Can he come too?
I'll write a letter to Mary
I'm writing a letter to Mary
Would you really recommend it?
How long have I been asleep?
It's nice and warm in here
Who's the photographer?
Who is the photographer?
Who's excited?
How do you like your job, Tom?
How do you like my new hat?
I'm too old
You'll take care of that
Will you be quiet?
Where's the beard?
I'm still crying
It's raining hard outside
Are your parents home?
Only my dad.
Are we going to stay here?
I don't see why not.
You're sure it's impossible?
Are you sure it's impossible?
It's so bitter
Tom?
Do you mind if I join in?
Tatoeba is so fast!
I can't believe it!
It doesn't even make sense
What's not to like?
Why are you siding with her?
Why are you siding with him?
Why are you siding with Tom?
I told you it wasn't him
I told you it wasn't her
Are we really in 2014?
He doesn't shave his legs
Where's Dublin?
Have you already eaten?
Where is Tehran?
Tonight it's your turn
We are all so fucking pumped!
Tomorrow I'll come to Tehran
Where's Tehran?
Thank God this week is over!
Are you in the square?
Have a safe trip to China!
What beer are you drinking?
I know it's bad
We are only people, not gods
You won?
Is that the station?
I don't speak Arabic very well
I don't speak French fluently
Where is a kosher restaurant?
Where is a halal restaurant?
So where are you girls going?
So where are you guys going?
How are you feeling now?
I know you like to travel, Tom
How afraid I was!
I'll go to Ireland
You'll go to Ireland
He'll go to Ireland
She'll go to Ireland
We'll go to Ireland
They'll go to Ireland
You're learning Irish
I love the genuine smiles!
How I have missed you!
Let's get started then!
I don't have a lot of time
Can you take care of it?
Well done, my friends
Well done, my friend
Tom's eyes widened in surprise
It's pretty cold outside
I'm not lost
I'm just not sure where I am
I thought we had an agreement.
I've had plenty to eat
I've had enough to eat
I don't feel so happy
I don't feel all that hungry
We aren't prepared
Who's been drinking my wine?
Thank you, Einstein
Please don't cut yourself
I'm desperate and confused
I'm in love and I'm confused
I hate myself because I'm ugly
Heroes don't die
How was the wind yesterday?
Leave, you deer!
Are we agreed?
She's got two teeth?
It was six o'clock
I'm not a great swimmer
I've been evicted
We don't deserve all of this
Does anyone want a new house?
I'm sorry, but I can't resist
We have some great news!
I can't wait to get a copy
I guess we'll never know
There's a dog barking there
Where are you guys going?
Silence!
I'm hungry
What about you?
Why do you think Tom is late?
Aliens?
Who knows?
I love him, but he's gay
You'll need some money
I'm not too keen on it
I think that he's an idiot
Do you like to exercise?
Can you toss the salad?
He's such a sweet guy
I'm average-looking
You're like a sister to me
I asked Tom what he'd advise
I asked Tom what he'd suggest
I asked Tom what he'd do
I asked Tom how he'd do it
Do you like the taste of beer?
Do you like horror movies?
Have you ever travelled alone?
Is God important in your life?
Should gay marriage be legal?
He's as stupid as a rock
He's super hot
You're pretty cute too
I'm a little bit insecure
He's quite a catch
He's quite the catch
I didn't say that
That's your interpretation
I'll try to answer them all
That's part of my job
I simply don't trust Tom
I simply don't love Tom
He doesn't need any money!
There are no more cakes?
I ate both of them.
Debbie!
Do you hear me?
Do I have to stay in hospital?
Air out those shoes!
Are you smiling?
You know what?
Are they sleeping together?
Did you find a solution?
It's for hot summer days
Bye!
Let's do this again!
It's a rented car
It's freezing here!
We are doomed!
He grabbed the boy's hand
Who were you speaking with?
With whom were you speaking?
I want a pint of beer.
Do you like Earl Grey tea?
That's just speculation
He's alive and kicking
She's a true artist
He's a strapping young man
Don't expect any miracles
I'd like five meatballs
That's the only possibility
You can't rule the heart
Other lands, other customs
Work ennobles (the soul)
Will this help them?
I don't have all the symptoms
Let's hope it's an epic day
I'm afraid at night
I'll give you my opinion
I was hoping you'd ask that
How is this even possible?
What do you need to buy?
That's pure genius
What have I ever done to you?
Does he like you?
I'd like you to go with me
Let's go into the other room
Don't trust him
He's always lying
I'm glad Tom helped us
Who is this tall blond man?
Come on, Tom
I won't stand here all day
Damn it, Tom
I said no!
Can you give this to Tom?
It's very important.
I'll make sure he gets it.
God is all-powerful
We can't survive without food
Did he ask you out?
He's confident and strong
What item was it?
It's cooler tonight
When is school out?
When did Tom return?
When are you holding a sale?
We're in a safe place now
Tom's schoolbooks cost a lot
There's a run in your stocking
There's a cold wind today
The house is run-down
That's a safe guess
That's a sad excuse
Rub Tom's back with alcohol
Red doesn't look good on Mary
It's cold out
Let's make a run for it
Let's lie on the sand
Let's go for a sail
It's too early to decide
Is the top rung strong enough?
Is the bridge safe?
Is food scarce around here?
Is everything satisfactory?
It's only a rumor
I'm running short of cash
How far are we from the sea?
Here's the score of the opera
Don't let Tom run away
Does that answer satisfy you?
Do you go to school?
Did you salt this?
Could I borrow a saw?
Can you sail a boat?
Can you ride without a saddle?
As a rule, I don't drink
All the same, I want to see it
Who is the lucky guy?
Is Tom your boyfriend?
No, he's just a friend.
We're very busy right now
That's a difficult question
Let's go get something to eat
It's very hot in this room
Do you think you could help?
Do you think Tom is satisfied?
Do you think Tom is innocent?
Do you think about Tom a lot?
Do you really think so?
Can you get off work tomorrow?
Will that make a difference?
What do you make of all this?
I wish you'd make up your mind
You'll never see Tom again
We're here to see Tom
We'll go see Tom
We'll go visit Tom
Could you lend me some money?
Tom isn't just my boss
He's my friend, too
He's not my boyfriend
You're just like Tom
Do you ship overseas?
Is it any good?
Who voted for him?
You could use my help, Tom
What more could you ask for?
Tom won't give up so easily
Can you give us an example?
Tom says he'll give it a try
Are you texting Tom?
Which meat tastes the best?
My daughter's driving me crazy
I've been trying to avoid him
I've been trying to avoid her
I'll help.
I don't want to be interrupted
I'm not a child
Don't talk to me like I am
Don't talk to me that way
You're supposed to be working
We're supposed to be working
He's a ladies' man
Who started the fight?
It's part of the fun
Has anyone heard from Tom?
You're not a boy
You're not a girl
Who is in Iran?
You're from Iran
Mind the step!
Are these your daughters?
Have you seen Tom anywhere?
What's the title of the movie?
It's one of the reasons
Can you play well?
I'd like to visit Boston again
Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom
I don't expect them to win
Is everything OK with Tom?
It's Tom who needs convincing
She hasn't reimbursed me yet
He can't be single
He's too good-looking
What do you want to do first?
Wasn't Tom here earlier today?
What do you want to do next?
Do you want something to eat?
Sorry, I just ate.
It's about time you woke up
We didn't agree to anything!
Does Tom know you're here?
When you know, let me know
Where did Tom call from?
What time did Tom call?
Can you wait a minute?
Could you show Tom around?
He doesn't sleep anymore
She doesn't sleep anymore
Tom isn't sleeping now
Tom isn't still asleep, is he?
Does anybody here know Tom?
Do you play golf?
I'd like to live in Boston
Excuse me, I'm coming through
That's not very romantic
Can Tom stay for supper?
Did you tell Tom to do that?
Tell Tom we'll be ready
It's a nice little spot
Tom was Mary's first boyfriend
I totally don't believe you
That's too much information!
I don't want to know
That's a wise choice
What?!
No!
It's non influential
I'll tell you more
Where are you going to study?
I can't try it on!
Are you talking about Tom?
Have you seen Tom recently?
Have you seen Tom lately?
How's Tom been treating you?
I'm terrible at math
How did you learn to do this?
Who taught you how to do this?
Did Tom ask you out?
Tom is a ladies' man
You'd better get going
Can Tom come, too?
Do you miss me at all?
No more chatting!
It's cold outside
We'll be jealous
You'll be jealous
They'll be jealous
At what time can you be there?
Could you pass me the sugar?
Here you go.
Next year I'm going to Hawaii
Tom doesn't look nervous
Tom doesn't like you anymore
Have you heard about Tom?
That's exactly what Tom wanted
That's Tom playing the piano
What was Tom talking about?
Tom's son's name is John
We can't find Tom
May I see your ID?
May I see your identification?
I'm building a birdhouse
I'm a lousy cook
I'm an airplane mechanic
I'm glad we talked
I'm looking for somebody
Here's some more tea
Are you related to Tom?
I'll be back in three weeks
My son could've died
Tonight's not the night
I'm quite content with my life
Tom isn't answering his phone
Tom isn't pulling his weight
Mary isn't answering her phone
He isn't answering his phone
She isn't answering her phone
That's good enough for me
We'll be right with you
They haven't beaten us yet
Have I missed something?
Have they seen us?
Is anybody in here?
Did anybody come by?
What can anybody do?
Is anybody out there?
Did anybody take notes?
Did anybody see anybody?
Why would anybody do that?
Is anyone here a doctor?
Why would anyone do that?
Would anyone like some wine?
Is somebody down there?
Why would anyone do this?
Can someone call security?
Did anybody call for security?
Someone's trying to get in
Does anybody here feel sick?
There's not much anyone can do
Don't let anyone in his room
I didn't remember this!
Where's Lanzarote?
Did you order yours yet?
How's Lanzarote?
How is Lanzarote?
I've never been to Lanzarote
Mum!
Don't compare me with Sam!
Where's Tampa?
Nobody's right all the time
It looks like nobody's home
Nobody likes a know-it-all
Nobody wants to do it?
Has anybody heard from Tom?
Is anybody on the line?
Did anybody see Tom leave?
It sounds like somebody's home
Did someone find out about us?
Someone must've seen something
Is someone coming for us?
Tom couldn't have shot anyone
It could be anyone's

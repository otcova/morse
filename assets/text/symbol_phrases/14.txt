Tom's voice sounds like a kid
I'm not done reading it yet
Tom is haunted by Mary's ghost
They couldn't revive Tom
One more step and I'll shoot
What could I offer Tom?
It's a copy
I promise I'll be careful
What's in the safe?
Has Tom gone to Boston?
Those aren't any better
Did Tom suffer a lot?
We're psychic
Tom left and won't return
I'll light a candle
What could I tell Tom?
Tom won't refuse help
Don't you get cocky on me, now
Who's that dancing with Tom?
Of course, I'll forgive Tom
I can't sew or knit
I didn't agree right away
What if Tom doesn't come?
I'll decide tomorrow
We're about to leave
Are you sure it wasn't Tom?
Do you recognize those people?
Did you bring Tom?
That won't fit in my suitcase
I'd rather stay for a while
How could Tom get there?
I don't know where to turn
This is a wake-up call for Tom
We haven't seen Tom today
Did Tom and Mary break up?
The game's over
What's Tom's nickname?
Did you jump?
Tom's kindness affected Mary
When can Tom do this?
Why did you get up?
When can I go there?
I'm starting to hate you
We'll buy it
How did Tom get my number?
I can't afford such a car
We'll be co-workers
Tom's wallet is black
Tom won't do it now
I'm nobody's slave
Will we see you again?
I'm an educator
Don't let Tom touch you
We're a bit confused
I'm wasting my time here
Is Tom already there?
Did you go out today?
Tom won't do it for me
Who'll meet Tom?
That won't fit in my car
They didn't die
I want you, not Tom
Seriously, OK?
Just knock the hell..
I promise, I promise
Don't worry about it
Here, take a look
I eat bats, snakes and okra
I don't want to be ungrateful
I don't eat margarine
Can you see my ribs?
I love Texas!
We're a little puzzled
I love rocking chairs!
Are they speaking Berber?
I don't know
I guess.
I'm an angel
I can't show you my true form
I'm going to walk the dog
Is Tom one of your nephews?
Why are you here in Boston?
Tom didn't open his mouth
Please, Tom, don't go
I’m a single parent
I knew that I wasn't well
Can I warm up by the fire?
Is Yanni staying the night?
Can Tom stop?
Who made this pasta?
It's so huge
She's the wildest girl I know
Have you asked Tom?
Do you like my ass?
Where are you going?
We're hopeful
Those tests weren't approved
What would you advise to them?
Did Tom lose a lot today?
Can you fix the door?
I'm going to keep working hard
Did we get any donations?
That's all Tom left me
No, that's not it
I'll make it on my own
We're referees
What did you call Tom?
Well, what happened?
I didn't know where it was
Did you decide to con me?
Did he decide to con me?
We're a little confused
Did you see Tom there?
Do you read books?
Don't talk to Tom now
arrested / prisoner
You make me so fucking horny!
I didn't want to cum yet
Does Tom ever do this?
Do you ever cook?
“This year will be amazing
I'm going to Europe
to shout / to cry out
I'm very attached to Tom
to release / to let out
Did Tom say where Mary went?
What's all this for?
I don't have time for that now
Don't let Tom scratch you
Who is walking the dog?
I wasn't married back then
Does Tom like to dance?
Let's listen to a bit of music
I promise I won't do it again
They're minors
Don't ever wake me up again
Did you know he was stupid?
Which newspaper do you take?
What bad luck!
I'm from the east coast
It's too deep here to stand
Don't repress your emotions
Clench your butt-cheeks
She's farting all the time
I'm having my period
She's an easy girl
It's like you say
I'm tired
How about you?
I'm sure he's angry with me
I'll try to persuade Tom
Is it Tom?
Don't eat snow
Tom didn't stop yawning
We're surfers
How are you doing lately?
Don't underestimate Tom
He's smarter than he looks
Will Tom like it?
She didn't swim today
Tom's freind name is Pierre
We'll catch up with him
You're good at it
I can't get that in my bag
Will you take Tom home?
Mary isn't my wife anymore
I'll prove it to you all
Did Tom keep his promise?
Who needed it?
I'll go to my room
Look, Tom is on TV
I didn't bring my gloves
Does Tom owe you a lot?
Do you sell rakes?
Will these fit?
Tom's arm is fine
I'm going to buy a fridge
Who's Tom fighting?
Why's this so small?
We'll discuss that tomorrow
I'll be upstairs
I suspect that that's a lie
May I leave my suitcase here?
Here's Tom's phone number
Why's it so small?
Tom didn't calm down
Who's Tom walking with?
Are you going to vote for Tom?
Tom hasn't been treated fairly
Was Tom able to do it?
We're busy now
It's too loud in here
I can't hear you
The music's too loud
I'm a bit scared of Tom
Tom's remark was ignored
Tom's remarks were ignored
I'll go and get it
We're both grandfathers
Others were crying, too
Tom wasn't the only one crying
Mary was crying, too
School starts at 8:30
My wife's name is Mary
What's your wife's name?
How have you been lately?
Don't ever come here again
I won't stay here much longer
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Smoking isn't allowed in here
Don't go on foot
Doesn't Tom trust you?
Can I start?
Who's Tom's favorite actress?
Who else thinks so?
Tom's puppy licked his hand
He just doesn't know it yet
I'm having trouble hearing you
I'll only go if Tom goes
It's an old car
How long ago did Tom die?
Let's tell Tom about it
Are we early?
Do you have your own house?
I didn't think too much of it
Who was satisfied?
Can everyone here read?
I don't disagree with you
Was it hard for you?
Can we catch Tom?
Should we explain it to Tom?
Did you study hard?
Did Tom leave you?
Don't grumble
Who spoke to Tom?
I don't think so!
I'm not coming to Boston
We're evacuating the area
That's a woman
You've disturbed him
You've bothered him
You've upset him
Don't tease the dogs
I didn't eat much yesterday
I think I'll ask you out
What books has Tom read?
Is Tom worried?
Tom's such a drag
I don't eat ice cream
How could you believe Tom?
All dreams don't last long
Can you believe them?
I shouldn't do it
Will you be back soon?
He has a slim,athletic build
I'm addicted to cocks
I can't get enough of cocks
We're bookkeepers
Who isn't afraid?
Enough with the excuses!
Who's Tom friends with?
You're afraid of me
I'd like him to go there
One day you'll regret this
I feel like I'm in trouble
I'm unable to pay now
I won't buy this for Tom
How's Tom's foot?
That's my motto
Did you wake Tom up?
Don't have a fit!
I'd love to have a ferret
I won't change anything
What if Tom doesn't call?
They're closed
I'm thrifty
Will Tom do this, too?
Are you following us?
Are you all joking?
Look who's in there
I don't remember my mother
I didn't hear Tom's footsteps
I can't fix it
Do you still hate Tom?
It's an old boat
Don't let anybody in my room
I can't let Tom down
That won't fit in my bag
Tom ignored Mary's request
I don't walk fast
Is that the teacher?
Who uses these?
What's inside that?
Have you done everything?
What can we make with chicken?
Your ride's here
What a nice puppy!
I can't solve this
We're chemical engineers
Tom's leg is fine
We'll eat it
We're medics
Let's sit on the deck
Tom doesn't like pasta
Who did Tom call me?
Did you like that idea?
Is Tom home now?
You don't know if you want it
Who walked the dog?
They're heroes
Tom should've listened
I'll get over it somehow
We'll meet at noon
I'm tired of living here
We're good students
Do you think Tom is honest?
Don't pamper Tom
I'm not the cook
Where's the synagogue?
How do I tell Tom that?
A ba-na-na-na!
I have a problem, too
Yanni didn't see anything
Where's the temple?
Don't compare me to Tom
Don't lose your mind
How do you explain this?
How're you going to do that?
Don't feed this cat
This is my book, not Tom's
I'll come by bike
What's written here?
Can you come closer?
I can't quite hear you
I wouldn't wear that
Did Tom ask Mary to do that?
We're sound sleepers
Tom hasn't been here for days
How long has Tom been up?
I don't like making plans
We'll persuade Tom
Do you have a shovel?
I'm glad Yanni is gone
Have you asked Tom about that?
Yanni wants to apologize.
Next time...
There won't be a next time.
Today's a self-care day
Did you walk the dog?
What's Tom's rank?
What will Tom think of me?
How could you forget?
Where am I?
Who am I?
It's doubtful
I want to win the lottery!
I love you, Lisa!
I want to go to a cat café
I don't know what to watch
I wanna go to Tom's next time

How do you use it?
Could you give me a hug?

Tom's efforts came to nothing
Get out of the car now!
Do you have time on Friday?
Tom wouldn't forgive it to us

I know what I'm capable of

I'll only go if Tom does
A lot of people didn't agree
Tom doesn't call anymore
I don't like these either
Are they adults?
I don't need false friends
Are you a party member?
Was Tom ready?
We're movie buffs
I don't see anything
We'll stay open until 2:30
He doesn't give a damn!
I'll go get my things
Which street is this?
We're nice guys
I can't help but laugh
I admire Tom's endurance
Let's surprise them
Who is Anna's classmate?
I'm a relative of Tom's
This is Tom's cup
Do you think Tom is coming?
He's Jackie Chan
It's a picture of my family
Did you ask Tom to help Mary?
Am I a bad father?
I've never had bangs
It'll fall
When is Tom going home?
Will I get the job?
I'm sick of eating beans
What's in store for Tom?
Don't quarrel
They named their child Tom.
Should I wait for you?
When can I do this?
Tom won't do it alone
There's no time to spare
Alarm clocks don't work on me
How much did parking cost?
How much did parking cost you?
How much did it cost to park?
What did parking cost you?
What did parking cost?
Alarm clocks don't work for me
Tom says that he'll try
Let's stay friends
Is what Tom just said true?
Can I do the same?
Who's Tom's partner?
I was Dr. Jackson's patient
Why would anybody kill Tom?
Do you lift weights?
I'll make breakfast
What's an elf?
Tom couldn't answer that

Tom isn't yet thirty
We're painters
Are you a Catholic?
Yes, sir, I am.
Where's your mother?
My mother is at home, sir
She doesn't know I'm here
My father brought me here, sir
I'm not always like this
It's a girl
What's Murphy's Law?
Tom's gaze met mine
I'm sorry that I couldn't help
I'll make dinner tonight
Are you apprehensive?
What's a pendulum?
I'm going to need both of them
Tom isn't wearing a ring
When will you get to Boston?
We're already here.
Tom's right leg was amputated
I can't pay now
I'm not able to pay now
Are we in a hurry?
I'm going to eat out tonight
Who won the car?
Yanni wasn't raised religious
I'll stop by tonight
Are you a man or a woman?
Pardon me?
Can I pet your dog?
Can I pet your dog?
Careful, it's a pitbull.
It's a fortunate coincidence
What a fortunate coincidence!
Yanni's car ran out of gas
Yanni didn't wear his boots
I'll give them everything
Can I paint your face?
Tom is busy, as always
I don't really remember it
I'm not denying anything
Check the ballots!
It's so good you came
It's so good that you've come
They've finally given up
Shall I wash the lettuce?
You've got school on Saturdays
Are you going to let me speak?
Says who?
I'm very good at ironing
It's as though it were winter
It's as though it was winter
Don't worry, I won't forget
Tom's vomiting
Tom's a scoundrel
Tom's chundering
Tom's yawning in technicolour
Why does Tom do that?
I don't know
Perhaps to annoy us?
Why is Tom doing that?
I don't know
To annoy us, maybe?
Is it raining in your town?
Why do you ask?
Because I want to know.
Why are you asking?
Because I want to know.
These glasses don't suit me
They're too big
I'll have some couscous
I still can't move
Yanni's hair got messy
Do we have any ice left?
I really like my in-laws
Please read page 30
I'm a dominant top
Yanni's Berber was terrible
I love that, too
Well, here we are
My phone isn't new
Tom is drunk, as usual
I've decided to take this one
Tom isn't doing too badly
Do you need a job?
I won the 100-meter race
Do you like archery?
Tom doesn't have much hair
He's gay, but closeted
Sorry,I dont know what to say
Don't swear, please
Sex isn't everything
It's already noon
I'm feeling really blue
Tom isn't that fat
He's responsible for my pain
I'd really like to visit you
Don't jump
I didn't know any of this
What fell?
I wish we'd won
Do you really agree?
You naughty boy!
I'll go buy tickets
Stop being such a bookworm!
What's that on the floor?
We're Boston natives
I'm sorry for all of this
Tom didn't see us
I'm already on the plane
This wouldn't work
Tom is a kind-hearted man
I didn't know Tom was a furry
Did you find any errors?
I can't believe my eyes
Is that really you?
What a fool you've been!
Tom is sure he's right
Who else disagrees?
I don't need all of this
It doesn't help anything
I've never worn a hat
OK, so let's do it
I heard you're in trouble
Tom isn't liked here
Why did you agree to do this?
Tom's cheeks are red
I'll buy a pen for her
I'll buy a pen from her
Who gave you this idea?
Tom tried to do this, too
That's not a knife
That isn't a knife
We've parted ways
The weather's nice
I won't do this anymore
We're terrible dancers
I'll buy this bag for you
I'll buy you this bag
I'll carry this bag for you
I'll get you this bag
Why do you think Tom did this?
I won't help you anymore
She is rich, young, and pretty
I don't believe anyone
She hasn't even eaten lunch
Yes, he's from Brazil
What are my chances?
They’re not Chinese
We’re not Russian
Where’s the nearest pharmacy?
I’ll have the usual
May I borrow your garden hose?
May I borrow your shovel?
Can I borrow your garden hose?
Is it my turn to cut my hair?
I’m not ugly
That’s all for now
Tom, it’s me
Can I talk with you?
Tom, it’s me
Can we talk?
No one's coming
What time is it?”
What's in the sink?
I'd prefer to talk in French
We're prison guards
I can't find Tom
Which computer did you buy?
Yanni was so self-assured
I'm not free yet
That's a moot point
I know you're there
Why won't you talk to me?
How do you have this number?
Nobody knows I'm gay
What are you doing in Algiers?
Yanni's dog snarled its teeth
It can't fly anymore
Yanni didn't really care
I won't pay
We're seriously understaffed
Tom is my great-uncle
Tom isn't easily fooled
Are you color blind?
I'm bad at math
I won't protect you
My place isn't far from here
I'm going to buy a new TV
Where's my guitar case?
Tom won't need it anymore
Now let's go home
How bad!
OK, what's the plan?
I love chubby girls!
Yanni's dog started barking
Tom isn't a good role model
They're dwarves
It won't fly
Why do I need that?
Tom found Mary's ID
I'm going to coffee
Tom isn't sitting by himself
Doing that won't help them
They've reserved some seats
Should we flip a coin?
Tom didn't sharpen the knives
Let's split the money
He can't
What made her go with him?
What drove her to go with him?
Without sunlight, flowers die
She's jealous of our happiness
Do you at least speak Finnish?
It'll be even hotter tomorrow
He is well-informed
We're barbers
Tom's shirt is red
That's not for kitties!
He's been away from his family
He's mostly responsible
That's not for cats!
I'm sure we'll get lucky
Don't look at that
I hope you'll come again
I've already checked the list
We're morning people
I hope we'll be friends
Did you see my keys?
When did we do that?
We'll probably go
What are we standing for?
Let's sit down
Tom doesn't care about it
I'll take the cheaper one
How many pens do you want?
I may go, I may not go
You don't need to contact him
There's so much dust here
Tom isn't well, is he?
We used to play this game, too
He's as wise as his father
I'm not pressuring them
This beer's not cold
I don't know how to read
This isn't ethical
I doubt it, too
Tom isn't in good health
What an ugly carpet!
Tom snores, but not too loudly
Are you meditating?
Tom's smile widened
We're men now
Tom is a neighbor of Mary's
Who came here today?
I wish I'd done better
Tom opened the book to page 13
I didn't go to this school
I'm not a cook
Can I borrow these books?
Could I borrow these books?
I have a son who's a drummer
It's too big a risk
I knew you wouldn't fail
Mary did, too
We're programmers
I've apologized to you
We're going there
Tom didn't enter the house
Don't over-tighten the nut
I won't be back today
Tom doesn't like dancing
I've done all the laundry
It'll be fair
May I come?
Tom told you to come, too
I've found a buyer
Why did you need it?
We didn't have any fun
I'm quite suspicious
Why were you two quarreling?
I'm going there again tomorrow
He's a real pistol
Let's meet there
Do you have a charger?
Well, do you agree?
I'll take the next flight
Do you need a drink?
Why's Tom staring at me?
What are you staring at, Tom?
Is Tom really staring at us?
Why is Tom staring at us?
Tom's in it for the money
I'm going to the library
That's not a kitty toy!
I'll frame the painting
Tom is innocent, I'm sure
Those weren't jokes
I’m going where the sun shines
Can I help you?
No, it’s ok
Can I maybe use your phone?
I’m here for a few days
Yanni lives in Bejaia, Algeria
Did you masturbate?
I know you're awake
I don't remember my father
Tom isn't that smart
Excuse me.
Yes.
I'm dying without you
I'm dying without you
I'm dying without you
I can't stand clingy friends
I'll be right back
We're teachers of French
It's time to turn the page
I'm going to buy napkins
I don't know anything else
We're fairly fast swimmers
Are you on your period?
He couldn't care less
I wonder what CK stands for?
Are we stuck?
I wish I'd done that earlier
Tom isn't a stupid person
Oh, there you are
I'd leave it that way
We're slow walkers
Tom isn't my subordinate
Yanni's left arm became limp
Why didn't you stay?
Do you want it yet?
I'm going to move to Australia
Tom, how old are you?
I'll move
I'm dreaming of going to Japan
Which road should we take?
Tom doesn't really bark
He doesn't say what he thinks
He's hiding something
Is the road good?
We're not strong enough
We're prepared enough to win
I've already contributed
I'm currently writing a book
Tom's eyes met with Mary's
Where will you eat tomorrow?
Where's my other glove?
The movie's about to end
What a treat!
I'm just unlucky
We didn't like those men
Tom won't teach French anymore
What does that change?
Tom didn't like the food
We didn't quarrel
Who wants meatballs?
I'll have my hair cut today
Butt out!
What makes you feel alive?
It's from a meme I found
Will you excuse me?
Tom won't call the doctor
Tom is very well-read
Do you want some toast?
How did you ahead of me?
Tom hasn't registered yet
Is crime on the increase?
Does this one fit?
I've read ten books this month
We're speech coaches
Tom wasn't asked to speak
Tom isn't alone there
Where are my tools?
Don't be jealous
Are you older than me?
Tom won't prevail
Are you coming back home soon?
Who'll challenge me?
Don't be such a busybody
Tom isn't a poor man
Where did you two get married?
Do you think you can make it?
We're pretty good golfers
It's clear you lied
I can't leave without you
Do these fit?
I'm afraid of dogs at all
We hadn't enough time for it
No way!
Can you get by on your wages?
Give in!
I can't help being a fool
Your daughter's on drugs
Do you have any coughing?
Can I sleep out?
Don't talk around it
The meeting ended at 4:00 P.M
It'll get inflamed
The fire took 13 lives
They're like peas in a pod
What time can I be there?
What time shall we make it?
What are you talking about!?
What shall we play?
Above all, don't tell a lie
Above all, be true to yourself
Above all, we must be healthy
What a fine day it is!
How blue the sky is!
What a heavenly dress!
Hmmm, how shall I say this?
What an ambiguous expression!
Say, he is no more than a kid
Do you have anything hot?
I'd like something light
Have you got any baggage?
What made you so dissatisfied?
What shall I do for you?
Did you do your homework?
How do I fix the volume?
Be my right-hand man
I'd rather go by train
Round trip or one-way?
May I take your size, madam?
May I use your pencil?
Where is the sanitary section?
Must I speak English?
Where is English spoken?
Must I answer in English?
What hours is it open?
What are the business hours?
Can I do exercises?
It being rainy, I stayed home
It's threatening to rain
It's been raining
My face is swollen!
It's no use holding me back
I'll fix you up for the night
I feel so lucky!
Whatever is that noise?
Mary said to me, "Are you ill?
Waste not, want not
I don't know my address yet
Shall I ask Peter for help?
Two vanilla ice creams, please
Why is it called "loon"?
How complex?
Just fancy!
Which side is batting?
Pray forgive me!
At last, he went to America
Who cared?
Who is behind the plot?
Even if it rains, I'll start
That's a piece of pie
Let's be going now
Is that your carry-on luggage?
I'm for the bill
That's the meat of a hen
The man pleaded self-defence
Besides, it's starting to rain
The match ended in a 6-6 draw
There were few, if any, cases
I'm sorry to hear the news
How often have you been there?
Well, when exactly?
Do keep practicing!
It's all laid on
I'd like to try out skydiving
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Save money!
I mended my torn shirt, too
How old is he, then?
How does Jim go to school?
He goes by bus.
Now, go and have a good time
Oh, off with you
Might I have a look at this?
What lovely flowers these are!
Whose are these pens?
What a big book this is!
What's this in aid of?
Where is this train bound?
Can he write this character?
This town isn't lively
How boring this game is!
Whose are these shoes?
This minibus holds 25 persons
I didn't ask for a table here
Whose is this camera?
Is Mr Johnson in?
Will you eat a little cake?
Should I pay for the gas?
These are my thank-you notes
Mom!
Hurry!
Happy birthday!
I'll put him on the phone
Here comes a copper!
Well, do you like it?
Good show!
Should I insert coins first?
Did I hurt your feelings?
You're enjoying yourself
How glad I am to see you!
I work as Mr Eliot's assistant
Yes, please come
He can't get on in the world
It's no use regretting it now
When did you miss your purse?
No, you needn't go right now
No, I've never been there
Please don't walk too fast
I can't abide that noise
Have you any idea who he is?
Shall I buy some for him?
How lazy those boys are!
That boy of mine!
You needn't come
Do you think her attractive?
Can you swim across?
Do you want this watch mended?
Do you have a part-time job?
You'd better go to bed early
You cannot climb!
Oh, no!
I almost forgot!
Ouch!
My foot!
Oh, how awful!
Oh, just fill out this form
I'll call for you at six
Here's $5
It's only six pence per second
Can you subtract six from ten?
Come back!" he shouted
Did you work yesterday?
No, I don't," said Mr Jordan

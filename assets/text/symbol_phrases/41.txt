There's a crack in the ceiling
I'll knock your teeth out
My ears didn't stop ringing
Did I sound rude?
I'm scared of lightning
Give credit where credit's due
Why does Tom need all this?
When I was little, I had a top
That's the man I saw yesterday
What happened at school today?
Do you know what is happening?
Do you know what is going on?
Did you hear of it?
Have you heard of it?
Have you considered it?
The car's brakes were cut
How do you say that in Dutch?
You know?
How could they be so cruel?
Can you dress this wound?
Do you have permission?
Do I need permission?
I'd never eat a penguin
Don't you like your classes?
Mary is a girl, not a woman
Whose dog is it?
Has anybody seen Tom today?
Did anyone see Tom today?
This isn't an illusion
I don't love this side of me
If I can't come, I'll call you
He's bigger than us
He's tormented by guilt
I can't help him
They're merely assumptions
We don't believe in ghosts
Has Tom come back yet?
What is that guy's problem?
I'm going to vacuum the carpet
Why do people waste food?
I can't tell the truth
She's blind
Please answer!
Stop smoking, please
We're going to visit Germany
It's been a very busy day
Why's this happening now?
That's right
Can you prove Tom's guilt?
Oh, really?
Let me guess, Tom?
How did you know?
I'll tell you once I remember
What do you do after work?
What's in China?
You don't enjoy my jokes
Does anybody visit him?
Does anybody visit her?
Does anybody visit you?
I'd stay, but I can't
I'd go, but I can't
What's in the shop?
I'd come, but I can't
The phone's ringing
Nothing!
I'm talking and feeling well
You wanna fight me?!
What's both a sun and a moon?
How did she do what?
What's holy to you?
What's sacred to animals?
What do lizards value?
What knowledge is unnecessary?
You're not relevant
You're irrelevant
I managed to have sex!
Mazal tov!
I'm in a black house
We're in an unlit room
There's a fly inside the fruit
This apple is this fly's house
I hope they shut up!
I hope they stop talking!
I'm going to it
I'm travelling to her
We're on our way to him
I'm just setting out!
What do you find horrid?
Did you see Tom at the party?
I hit Tom in self-defense
Should we three go out to eat?
Should us three go out to eat?
I don't have a degree
Why did you come alone?
You've got to let the past go
Let go, Tom
Tom, you're stepping on my leg
What'd you scratch me for?
What'd you go and do that for?
So how was your day?
Why does blood taste metallic?
Let me guess, Tom?
How did you know?
Did the lightbulb burn out?
And yet, here we are.
About three years.
Has anyone seen my badge?
Why did they fight?
Let's sit at this table
They're not listening to me
Somebody's shouting for help
Repeat what I've just told you
Let's walk to the station
I'm keen on swimming
Am I on the wrong path?
Oh, that boy!
We don't have to
I couldn't think of anything
How about we stop here?
How is it pronounced?
I can't pronounce that name
How do you write your name?
Yanni didn't speak any Berber
The milk didn't taste right
Yanni didn't finish his milk
Are these your neighbors?
Tomorrow is a big day for you!
I'm finding it similar as well
This is an eye-socket
I can sleep anywhere, anytime
One moment..
If you trip, you'll fall down
What do I need that for?
That won't be forgiven
He couldn't tell her the truth
That's just how it is
Tom doesn't love us
Does he have it?
What about it?
I'll accompany you home
You could've killed me
You're back!
Are you good at reading maps?
Do you know how to read maps?
Can you read maps?
He won't take this lightly
Were you the one to find it?
I'm good at it
I seriously don't believe that
I really don't believe that
How is that allowed?
It's cozy in here
What does it take to be happy?
It didn't last very long
Are you speaking Romanian?
Did Tom tell you his password?
I found a key!
Are you a normal person?
Mary looked tired, too
I'm a plainspoken man
When does your class end?
It's way too windy
Do you think it's right?
What a challenge!
I'm sorry, I'll have to leave
Are you loved?
Fucking asshole!
He spoke on my behalf!
Speak on my behalf!
Tom's a pensioner
I'm the sixth son
Did you tell Tom what you ate?
You didn't do too badly
There's no more soup
For now, this is enough
It isn't really that expensive
It isn't that expensive
It isn't all that expensive
That'll be enough for now
That wasn't worth the trouble
Do you see me in your dreams?
I'm beside this
Latin.
I'll teach you!
I don’t hear a thing
Don't use bad tools
Sorry, I'm in a hurry
Which of these is unnecessary?
Tom is smart, but lazy
I'm your girl
I don't like cockroaches
There's ice everywhere
This won't be forgiven
Don't sweat it
I'm sure you'll rock it
Sorry"?
Yes, I'm a furry
Is it really any surprise?
You call this propaganda?
Where did Tom take my phone?
The new mechanic's name is Tom
Yes, I understand that
Light doesn’t know of darkness
It doesn't change anything
Tom doesn't like football
Do you obey your mother?
I'm so happy that you've come
I'm broke
You're loaded
But they're feeling good
How much fruit did you eat?
Don't touch my typewriter
It was good that you didn't go
It was good you didn't go
Eventually, prices will go up
Look at that good-looking girl
Look at that good-looking guy
Look at that good-looking man
Is this machine still usable?
Is this all you have?
Is that mouse dead?
It's been fine for a week
Hello!
Why's your webcam on?
This microphone isn't working
Is this microphone on?
I don't make the rules here
It won't make much difference
It's become quite common
I'd like climb Mt
I've given him the brush off
It's been raining off and on
Who told Tom I was here?
Who told Tom that I was here?
Do you still like me?
What games does Tom like?
That's why we need new options
We don't need to do anything
They need us, and we need them
We don't need any more lawyers
We don't need people like that
I don't need a receipt
Well, I need to think about it
I've decided I need to do that
Where is Tom when we need him?
Do you need me to come over?
Write this down, please
Two Maultaschen!
Can I count on leniency?
When does summer break start?
We're glad to meet you
That's Tom's step-daughter
Everything is in God's hands
It smells good, doesn't it?
How will this help us?
When should I visit you?
That's basically it
Yanni is not Ziri's friend
Yanni is not Ziri's friend
Yanni is not Ziri's friend
He is his co-worker

Why?
Your son wants to take a dump.
Are you in there?
Why?
Your son wants to take a leak.
Take him to the backyard.
So please give me 20 minutes
This job wasn't easy
Did you love your first kiss?
We can go, can't we?
Let's go get it
We're pretty late
Are you coming on Monday?
The wind didn't stop
I'm not a furry!
Do you still believe them?
Hello Roger!
I'm well
I'm hungry as a hog
Those are Tom's grandchildren
Who's having sex with who?
Please don't sing with me
When do you want me to call?
Did you ask Tom about that?
How can you prove it?
Was Tom the one who made this?
Have you gotten used to it?
Wait, don't turn around
This money isn't enough
Tom is worried that we'll lose
I've forgotten how to do it
Would you mind looking away?
Who doesn't know the problem!
Why does the UN exist?
Is this your signature?
Where is Tom going now?
Nobody home?
That's Tom's uncle
Come on!
Let's go!
How do I get started?
Is this a good idea?
How should I start?
How do I study best?
Clock's ticking
The clock's ticking
When should I be there?
I'm not feeling it
It's very smoky in there
How did she do that?
Do what?
That's Tom's step-brother
I must've been wrong
I came, I saw, I won
Do you feel dizzy?
It's hurting Thomas there
And you?
What are you doing?
That's Tom's step-father
I'd like to contribute
You won't be recognized
That won't happen tonight
Mary isn't unattractive
If you want, we can do that
Well, I quit
It looks so good!
Whose skis are this?
Tom is worried we'll lose
Can we be sure of this?
Does Tom play Animal Crossing?
Mary was sleepy, too
Tom hasn't finished the job
Look!
The cat's in the kitchen!
Does Tom play hockey?
Does Tom play water polo?
Does Tom run cross country?
Don't worry, kids
Santa is immune to Covid-19
Now it's there
Now he's there
Don't come in my room
Why all this skepticism?
I've never seen Tom performing
I spent $300 today
I'd suggest going there by bus
Why should I join a union?
Why should I join a sorority?
I couldn't attend the ceremony
I don't really like cheese
Don't bother me here
You're talking too loudly
Tom isn't a boy
He's a man
I'd like you to be my friend
Tom, do you play chess?
Here's a picture of my family
Can't you fall asleep?
A bit of both?
I hear you've been sick
I hear that you've been sick
Never do such a thing again!
They're not friends
Let's go see the game
Worries don't drown in alcohol
Yes, a coffee, please
I'll arrive on Christmas Day
He's an experienced teacher
I decided I'd stay
I've decided I'll stay
Do you have young children?
Don't eat a lot of bread
Did you enjoy your vacation?
When will this be done?
I'm still a cosplayer at heart
Don't make matters worse
We won't tolerate bullying
But how big is your computer?
May I close the window?
I'm cold
Big men aren't always strong
In which bed do I sleep?
I'm not leading you there
Please be back by 2:30
You come tomorrow as well!
Hello!
How are you feeling?
Believe it or not, that's true
I am calling the police!
Will you come?
Is it true that he is dead?
Is it true that he died?
Let's hold up our teddy bears
You're enjoying this, right?
Can you send me this letter?
As for me, I'm satisfied
Tom's blanket has trains on it
Is that one Sonic?
Let's build a pillow fort
They're not pull-ups!
They're my night gear
Brothers shouldn't quarrel
Brothers shouldn't fight
It's beyond my control
Tom spiked Mary's drink
Tom doesn't like couscous
When will this war end?
I don't need any of this
How much money do we owe Tom?
You can't take Tom seriously
Has anyone seen Tom today?
Could you lend it to me?
Don't tell Tom about that
Are these your cats?
This isn't our concern
You're stepping on my foot
Tom is smart, but he's lazy
The pears aren't ripe yet
Tom is waiting for you, Mary
I think this one's my favorite
We'll have lunch soon
What's the name of Tom's bar?
We can't speak French
Don't worry
Do you want to fight me?
Do you obey your parents?
Did that help?
Do you want some chestnuts?
What did you expect?
I'll show you the way
This doesn't have any calories
Have you done your chores?
You have a big heart!
If you come, he'll come too
Why'd you hate me?
Why don't they have time?
I'm sleepy
Can you read me a story?
They'll like this game
I'm going to buy a flag
Turn off the vacuum cleaner!
You'll need to work every day
Are you Colombian?
It's never enough with you
I see my brother's glass
Where did you learn Maltese?
I don't have breakfast
The table doesn't have drawers
Bite me!
What is Christianity?
I've been thinking of you
Did you have a nice day?
Whose children are these?
I'm tired
Can you read me a story?
The printer isn't working
Tom is a man, and I'm a woman
Where should we put it?
I'm liking this feeling
Do you know my address?
Which trumpet did Tom buy?
You won't stop me
May I have some more?
She's the regional champion
May I use the chair here?
You'll write a letter
That's Tom's granddaughter
Did I do this correctly?
That last part is self-evident
The last part is self-evident
We didn't see anyone there
You'd better take the elevator
Are you free next Monday?
Why didn't you have breakfast?
Russian is nice, but difficult
We're still very young
We won't eat
We're not going to eat
Do they trust you?
What's burning?
They've all left
We're going on a cruise
Is it your first school day?
Did you make all this up?
The cat's name is Tom
Have you ever made Tom cry?
This doesn't satisfy me
She's a nice person
He's a nice person
Are you planning a trip?
Tom doesn't kill animals
Tom won't kill animals
Let's drink some coffee
Let's drink this wine
He didn't even say hello
He didn't even say hi
Tom didn't even say "hello
Tom didn't even say "hi
It's okay, Tom
You're safe now
It's okay
You're safe now
You're hallucinating
Am I in China?
Did you hear Tom singing?
The truth always wins.
Which truth?
I wonder what's in this drawer
Why did you fall?
Where's Tom?
Cleaning his room.
We can't blame Tom for this
Don't let anybody in here
Come closer, we won't bite you
I'll fly to Hanoi tomorrow
Tom didn't push Mary
You'll see
The truth will win.
I just don't know whose truth.
How inconsiderate of you!
What a rude child!
When should I do this?
Do you still remember me?
Where did they all go?
Don't sit on this chair
Didn't Tom go to school today?
Shit!
Stop!
You're staying strong
You’re a beastly person!
The community’s good
The machine's running
I'm alive!
That's Tom's aunt
It's beyond bourgeois
That's revolting
I'm going insane!
You look wretched!
What is communication?
I amn't looking
My cat doesn't pay me
It's nice to chat
We're going to the bottom
Hey hey hey!
Listen, you
You're handsome!
Mary was laughing, too
It's time for gymnastics!
I'm sixteen
Why did you decide to do this?
My ladder's banjaxed
Drink some fresh water!
It can’t be this small
He's always cheerful
He's always upbeat
You farted again!
Where was this book made?
Here's another example
He's really into chemistry
Gimme a kiss!
Everyone's my enemy
I'll talk about French
I've barely seen it
This won't do any good
Does it feel good on you?
Do you feel like it fits you?
Can I eat some fruit?
Figure out your own problems!
Hurry up, let's go!
I'm running out of patience
We're leaving
Don't do that again!
I don't care!
We weren't asked to do that
Tom's request surprised Mary
I am escaping to Tamariγt
I've got a migraine
You're not my husband
What?!
That's it, Tom!
At what time?
Who doesn't like fruit?
How could they do this?
Search!
Hide!
Are you coughing?
Have a laugh!
Maybe!
You shouldn't do such things
Are you invited?
Have you bought a ticket yet?
I'm exhausted
Try some!
Have you been beaten?
Who taught her English?
Am I crazy!
Answer the phone!

Mary isn't ugly
That's Tom's grandson
I'm not scared yet
Can I have another roll?
Can I have another donut?
Who has a key to this room?
Either you or I'll have to go
Maybe we'd better leave
Who can vouch for you?
How did that help us?

Tom's house is made of wood
Tom's house is being painted
This isn't my daughter
A crocodile ate up Tom.
A cannibalistic crocodile?
All these eggs aren't fresh
After a while, it got dark
After a while, it became dark
Did Tom say where he worked?
Can I leave my suitcases here?
Well, did you find it?
Is Tom still here?
No, he's already left.
Has Tom already left?
No, he's still here.
OK, what do I do now?
What now?
I don't know
It's a very strange family
Do you regret that?
Who took your passports?
What's your problem with me?
Do I have to eat this?
What is happening out there?
Why don't you drink something?
Who is the guest?
It wasn't our fault
Why do you refuse to do it?
Why wouldn't you help us?
Don't sit on that chair
Can I have another doughnut?
How does this help me?
How do I learn Berber fast?
How do I learn Berber faster?
Yanni's Berber is still basic

They're my grandma's dentures
I don't even live in Algeria
I can't stomach this
It's just a fairy tale
Did the match start yet?
I'm waiting for it to start.

A bottle of wine, please
People don't like Mary
Tom won't eat beans
The bananas aren't tasty
How can we get what we want?
Could I leave a message?
Your money or your life?
Don't pressure me
Let me consider.
Do you want to buy it or not?
What would we do without love?
Does she work in a team?
I don't like white wine
Which is the newest one?
Was it only a dream?
Don't touch the fruit, please!
How long will the break last?
Tom doesn't like sandwiches
It's only ten o'clock
That's Tom's older sister
Life is life - protect it!
Shall we meet at the cafe?
Don't put your safety at risk
They're men
Turn off the radio!
I'm thrilled about everything
Did we really have to do that?
Why shouldn't I help Tom?
Is the machine running?
Mary's always up for a laugh
Who's feeling the same?
Tom doesn't like this society
What's causing the noise?
Tom wasn't a church-going man
Those are Tom's cousins
Do I have to go there?
Is this movie interesting?
Does he know?
Should I fix it then?

I'm a big fan
The water is ice cold!

That must be celebrated!
Did you end up finding it?
Alice doesn't like pears
Do you work at a supermarket?
I'll be taking my leave
I haven't even tried yet
Did anyone else see you?
Were you seen by anyone else?
Pick a card, any card
Can you talk now?
What a great joke!
I don't like that song
Don't ask Tom for help
Bartender, I need a refill
Can you find some more proof?
I've got no proof
I've got no evidence
Are you a man or a mouse?
I surrender!
Could I please talk to Tom?
You'll need an empty USB stick
How do I add new sentences?
How can I add new sentences?
That's even worse
Why do people like this?
Why are people like this?
Can you come over here?
It's morning in Boston

Does my French sound weird?
This way, I agree with you!
On that, I agree with you!
Can we breathe in space?
Why is it so cold in space?
I'll eat pizza
I'll eat some pizza
A tree fell on Tom's car
The match was a non-event
COVID-19's been crazy recently
Are those sawflies?
Tom's argument was unsound
Mary isn't my daughter
She's my wife
I didn't know Tom was an ancom
Why is it so hot in here?
Why is everyone so busy?
What's making all that noise?
That's Tom's cousin
Did you say hi to Tom?
We weren't attacked
Where were you?
I was at Tom's.
I was at the beach.
Where's Tom?
I think he's on the porch.
Tom is a boy, isn't he?
Did Tom go to class today?
”Mary isn't my daughter
She's my wife.
Tom, that's outrageous!
We don't need it yet
When did it happen to you?
How many apples are in there?
You're Czech, aren't you?
What a nice smell!
What's it doing there?
It smells so nice!
It smells so good!
Don't tell me yet
They're university students
I'm running out of patience!
Can you play backgammon?
We'll need to nudge Tom a bit
It doesn't need to be this way
I'll need it
You don't really need that
Please don't be so greedy
This isn't easy to read
That's not what we need
That isn't what we need
That's why you need to leave
That's why you need to do that
That's why you should do that
It's what our customers want
Do you need any more money?
Get to the point, please
What's this story based on?
Let's leave this matter to Tom
Let me finish, please
What made you scream?
That doesn't frighten me
Have you read Tom's will?
Yanni didn't have a religion
Yanni didn't have any friends
We're a little too young
Can I leave my bike here?
Why isn't Skura wearing hijab?
Yanni's neighbors are Muslim
Yanni wasn't Muslim
Why do you still do that?
Then, it's a man
Did Tom talk to you yesterday?
Don't let him drink
How did you feel at night?
Tom didn't ask me anything
You're making fun of me
That's a good opinion
This can't be allowed
Do you have a razor?
I love Neo-Aramaic languages
This isn't yet certain
Will three be enough?
Yep, I have
I've always wanted to see it.
I'm teaching myself Japanese
I'm self-studying Japanese
Of course, I want one of those
This time you'll fail

What's this sound?
It's jackals.
How old is this museum?
That's a spice
I'm entirely alone
Yanni didn't really speak much
I'm a humble guy
It's finished!
The cat's cold
That's unnecessary!
Everything's disgusting
The fruit's round
You don't love
I'm plenty strong!
You did what to it?
That's my pet
That's definitely the case
Can I hug your wife?
Hey, hey, hey..
No hugs, please.
I'm going to fight you

Talk, dad!
Can I hug your husband?
No!
We've written a lot
I'm buying a rose
It's me again
That isn't my daughter
I don't like to castle
I don't like castling
Have I changed so much?
This house is scorpion-free
Tom dried Mary's tears
You guys aren't invited
Do you know your duties?
Did Tom understand everything?
You're always welcome
Well, that's a shame
What's yours?
Why's this happening?
He's my daughter's best friend
Tom's house has a chimney
What does Tom need that for?
Will you sell this to me?
Where's my bracelet?
Tom didn't promise us anything
We definitely can't win
Did you manage to defeat Tom?
Aren't you married yet?
That's Tom's younger brother
Things won't get any better
How old is this house?
I'm tired today
There's no more wine
Who'll handle this case?
I wonder what's in the safe
Will you need anything else?
Congratulations!
This isn't so important
I adore Fridays!
That's Tom's step-son
How do I get out of this?
Tom couldn't fix it
Are you going by ship?
Let's only speak French
I'd say that's enough
Are you getting better?
Tom wouldn't forgive us
Your help won't be needed
Seize the day!
This isn't my decision
Buy a beautiful dress!
Do you like strawberry jam?
Did Tom go anywhere last week?
What a beautiful song!
How can this be resolved?
That's poison
Is that dangerous to health?
Tom is Canadian, too
Who'll do all this?
That's Tom's grandmother
Do you need the password?
Mary is the girl's name
Did you buy that tractor?
Will this be useful?

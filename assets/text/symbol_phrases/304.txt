Is he yet living?
I didn't want him to hear too
I didn't want her to hear too
Is this a bird?
Hello, I'm called Pekka
What are you called?
I don't want to eat today
I'm ashamed to have done that
I'm sick of waiting!
I'm fed up of waiting!
Calm down, please
This sentence is too long!
I'm born in October
Do you really not understand?
Do you really not get it?
Tom works at McDonald's
Tom works at Mickey D's
Tom works at Macca's
It wasn't a conscious decision
Tom's car spun out of control
Tom's life spun out of control
Oh no!
I don't feel like doing that
It's a disadvantage to be ugly
In this field, sure.
I'm listening to a podcast
Tom is a flat-earther
Don't listen to gossip
Stop always being like that!
Pay attention!
You look tired, really
Is he an uncle?
I'm fed up with all this noise
I'm tired of all this noise
Our screwups won't damn us
Since when?
Tom's the bad kind of patriot
Why tear down borders?
Who blew up the towers?
I can't be entirely sure
Things got better!
I'm a peasant
I'm a hillbilly
Do you have a partner?
Don't be such a prude
How far is it to town?
I'm sorry for lying about that
It's 2:30
I don't insult them
Would you lie for me?
Are those apples ripe?
Can we meet on Monday?
Why are you putting it here?
Don't put it on the carpet!
They're really tired out
They're really tired
You can't buy dignity
Dignity can't be bought
I listen, but I don't hear
Who else?
A little bit more?
Can I call?
We'll free the prisoners
I understood Tom's plan
This is fifty-five
No more, no less
This is fifty-five
Tom's parents hugged him
It's Monday night
It'll be on Monday night
This is Tom's fault
The accident was Tom's fault
It's Tom's first time
It's Tom's first time here
It's Tom's, isn't it?
It's in French
It's two-thirty
It's a French book
It's three pounds
It's mine, not Tom's
That's Tom's car, isn't it?
It's a common courtesy
What a splendid idea!
When is the rent due?
Who're you saying has it?
I don't want you to work there
Tom's cat is sick
He's been looking for you
He's been looking for you guys
Nice job!
Is Tom rich?
Good Shabbos!
It's what Tom painted
It's about three miles
What have I told you?
I'm not going to bite you
It's a Canadian company
It's because I love Tom
It's because Tom loves me
It's not that easy, is it?
It wasn't that hard, was it?
It wasn't that soft, was it?
It isn't that easy, is it?
It's three blocks from here
Did you really not understand?
Did you really not get it?
Why did you put it there?
It's enough for three days
That's a catchy tune
There's lots of food
Tom is going over to Mary's
Tom didn't wave back
Mary didn't wave back
The cliffs aren't that high
l don't think it's wrong
Tom plays Magic: The Gathering
Tom doesn’t age
Tom doesn’t age
Don't worry
I've got a new phone
Let's analyze this picture
I'm working with you
In my opinion, no
Do you have a free room?
Is there any of them left?
It's a kind of cat
Tom's eyesight is really bad
Do all birds have feathers?
Why do birds have wings?
How wings help birds fly?
Which bird can not fly?
How high can birds fly?
Can a puffin fly?
Can a kiwi bird fly?
What does the pelican eat?
How dangerous is an ostrich?
How long do frogs live for?
What do alligators eat?
She's starting to practice
Everyone, pair up
Don't wake a sleeping cat
You're wasting too much water
It was just small talk.
What do pelicans eat?
It's very crowded in here
It's part of Algeria
How much money do you have?
Zilch.
He doesn't understand
She doesn't understand
Lomé is the capital of Togo
Father still hasn't returned
I can't allow myself to buy it
It hasn't rained yet today
Here's your change!
I have to tell him about that?
Going somewhere?
Don't get so riled up
You're too perfect
You can't really be serious
Chill out, dude!
I'm busy until four o'clock
I'm busy until four
We've got nice weather today
Mrs. Meyer is so pretty
I'll be at the convention
Humans can't live without air
I can't ever find time to read
It's none of Tom's business
Does anyone have a headache?
Are you OK?
It's about 2:30
It wasn't as easy as I thought
Can we check in already?
Was that inexpensive?
And what is the good news?
Hagåtña is the capital of Guam
Did I get a good grade?
You never studied Danish?
Try it, please
This pen's ink is indelible
Are we going?
Charmed!
Down!
Devil!
Police!
Still?
Open!
Served?
Tomorrow?
Boy!
Yesterday?
Her?
Did you hear?
Don't sleep
Are you Chamorro?
Don’t bother explaining
Because I’m not interested
Don’t fret about it
Who is the oldest?
Are you going to a party?
It's fun to go out with Tom
It's Tom's Christmas present
Has is started snowing yet?
It's already three o'clock
It's not quite three o'clock
It's almost three o'clock
It's just after three o'clock
It's Tom's word against Mary's
It's 2:30 right now
It's pride that drives Tom
It's as easy as pie for Tom
It's hard to master French
Wasn't her name on the list?
I think I don't deserve it
Don't surprise me like that
Is nobody else coming?
Geez - I'm getting nervous
What's up?
What happened?
What's wrong?
What happened?
I'm rolling in cash
Now, now, just calm down
Morning!
Sorry, did I keep you waiting?
What happened?
Are you OK?
Can nobody else come?
That's right, unfortunately
We don't exchange money
I don't understand
I don't get it
Why did you arrive so early?
How's life in Paris?
Have you ever had a boyfriend?
Don’t worry about it too much
Is anyone on Twitter?
Does anyone use Twitter?
I’ll do my best too
Um, what was I going to say?
Ok then, please do it that way
The inn doesn’t provide lunch
What do you think?
Good morning!
I'm going to be late for work
I wish I wasn't even born
I told you to wake me up at 7.
Sorry, I forgot.
They’re going out together
Why don’t you reconsider?
It’s already midnight
I don’t want to get any older
I’d like two ask two questions
Don’t take life so seriously
“Hey listen!
That’s an even better deal
You're so impatient!
Where did you find this?
I'd looked everywhere for it!
Where did you find this?
Do you have money for a taxi?
I've been waiting for this!
At long last!
We'd better forget it
We're having hamburgers
I'm full of suppressed desires
Would you please resend it?
How old is the building?
I don't need any help at all
The soul doesn't have a body
Let's all go to the funfair
Ah, how beautiful!
I, as president, appointed him
Where did you learn Esperanto?
And he said: Swear then to me
I'm looking for a bar
Is it raining in your city?
What flower do you see?
He would've told us
She would've told us
I would've told you
Fear not, telling the truth
Don't massacre your animals
Oh my God, what will we do?
Oh my God, what'll we do?
I'll go there if you go there
It's impossible to trust him
Suddenly, she disappeared
I didn't see others
Which of us lost his bag?
He doesn't have any money
What a struggle where was!
Open the door and let him in!
Bird" is the word
It's time to pack up
What time will Tom arrive?
It's the third today
Tom's idea intrigued Mary
It's a bit expensive
It's a pity Tom couldn't come
It's Tom's first day at school
It's important I hear this
It's difficult to learn French
That's my favorite French word
It's you Mary loves, not me
It's very cold here in October
It's 2:30 by my watch
It's warm here all year round
It's an answer to Tom's letter
Have you seen my friends?
It's possible Tom won't come
It's a pity you couldn't come
We're down
I don't mean to brag
I wish you'd never told me
You don't seem to like her
You don't seem to like him
Let's celebrate our victory!
Let's celebrate our victory
That isn't an orange tree
Tom didn't get ill
Tom's mum is very strict
He's always so busy
You're butchers, aren't you?
Don't you mind that parrot
How will that do?
Will you let me make the tea?
You're wrong . .
How?
Jane, you COULDN'T!
Marilla, what if I fail!
I don't see the necessity
There isn't any bright side.
It's really a beautiful world.
I must get Marilla's tea
Marilla's face was rather grim
Can I have another piece?
Where does the dark go, Anne?
I want to know.'
Haven't you heard?
Make an effort!
Swallow it!
Delicious!
Wise up!
Yippee!
Cease!
Move it!
He's a CIA agent
I'm in a great mood today
You're my lawyer
I'm a financial analyst
Don't worry
It's a very common mistake
They say he's in on the secret
I've gained weight again
My diet is wide-ranging
I need three volunteers!
I'd already told you
I hope Emi doesn't take long
I'm tired of waiting for her
He's very easily distracted
I've only glanced through it
If I were you, I'd work harder
When you're done, go outside
Don't forget to add a stamp
I'm a friend of his
I'm a friend of hers
I'm a friend of theirs
You learn, too!
I'm off home
Careful with that lighter.
It's a joke, of course
I'm not a telltale
He isn't fat but slim
The bus isn't new but old
The car isn't clean but dirty
It isn't small but big
Putin is a schmuck!
Is that all I am to you?
Well, never mind
This island is a pirates' den
What didn't they get?
Hell's gate is open already?
Tom, she's your mother
Why don't you sit down?
Feeling like summer?
No thanks, that's not my thing
Do you know whom I met there?
I'm forced to agree with her
Have you finished pissing?
I don't think it's wrong
I don’t think I’ll succeed
Unfortunately, that's the case
Can't anybody else come?
Can't anyone else come?
You're wasting a lot of water
How dangerous are ostriches?
How long do frogs live?
I'm on the roof now
What do you feed your cats?
What kept you up all night?
Tom still hasn't returned
Wasn't your name on the list?
I'm tired of singing
The door didn't want to close
Here's my passport
It's too big for you
We'll show them who we are
That's going to be my horse
Japan won't stop surprising us
Screaming isn't singing
Shouting isn't singing
How did you dare!
Dogs and cats aren't friends
You'll become teachers
You're going to be teachers
You'll be teachers
There's a fire in the oven
Can you see your own mistake?
He's absent because he's sick
I'm admiring the landscape
You're too lazy
You're a couch potato
Where've you been?
I didn't spend a penny
Tom isn't a neophyte
Shut your claptrap, everybody!
You've written the report
I can't ride a motorcycle
Are you sure no one's around?
We've already been over this
I'm too tired to cook tonight
I'm too tired tonight
I'm too tired
Can you wait until tomorrow?
I'm way too tired
Am I dead?
Am I dead or am I dreaming?
I’d surely get car sick
Now, you could kill him
Oh, it's snow!
I've got strawberries
Would you like some?
I don't think I deserve this
I can't even find time to read
That's a different discussion
Do what you want!
Let's go to karaoke
I met you, and that's enough
I'm picking my nose
How old is the Bible?
Don't sit on the rocks
She's painting her nails
I can't calculate the distance
It's a party here
They're going to have problems
Is the skirt not too short?
Is the price acceptable?
Yes, like it was yesterday.
I'm sad when it rains
I won't take your money
That's a deceitful impression
It's some shitty day today
Is it okay to trust Tom?
I'm taking a tomato
I'm picking up a tomato
Is this door always locked?
I don't get the point of it
How did you open that box?
I'm annoyed with translating!
Don't distract me anymore
I wasn't expecting guests
What's happening to Tom?
I'm not worth such sacrifices
Did you say this to me?
Can we come tomorrow?
Man's life is short
That's unconfirmed information
I'm an idler
I won't be disappointed
You didn't recognize me?
Are you sure it's hers?
That's where I want to live!
You can't live like that
It's said to be hot here
Go on away out of that!
You just said that to me?
It's easy for Alberto to learn
Fear God!
Be respectful!
I'm laughing
These were missing!
Open it!
My God!
Ignore him!
Be strong!
It was Tom's proudest moment
I couldn't wait to tell Tom
Tom couldn't wait to tell Mary
Mine?
Tom won't be right
Isn't my friend Maltese?
Is my friend not Maltese?
Sorry!
I'm not good at explaining
I'm going to give up
Did Tom get there in time?
Have a good evening!
I won't complain about that
Tom isn't very patriotic
I'm very fond of Tom
Out you go!
Have you fed the cat?
Was Tom seriously hurt?
I didn't get a raise
I don't like spinach
Here's another day in London
Your Baurus are delicious!
Did you tell her everything?
Have mercy on us, we beg you
Less possessions, less boredom
Forget it!
Tom's real passion is art
Tom's real passion is music
Good to see you!
I'm just on my way home
What'd you say?
You failed again?
You're hopeless, aren't you!
I don't think that that'll fly
Can you open the door, please?
What am I supposed to regret?
You didn't understand me
In the end, Tom gave up
I'm sure Mary is gravely ill
You're bored
I don't travel very much
Do you play baseball?
Was that a hint?
Is this blue?
Is that blue?
Could you spell that?
Why is grass green?
Hmmmm, cool!
Do you have green?
What a pineapple!
Attention: fragile
I didn't bet
It doesn't rain

Is today Saturday?
It's a mushroom
Tom's hands were shaking
Will you try?
Should I sell it?
How are you doing?
A little better.
What is it, dear?
How much is he paying you?
How much is Tom paying you?
How much is she paying you?
I didn't expect to have fun
Tom, you should come too
I'm not that old!
Did you just call me old?
You're a very nice person
It's so peaceful here
I don't usually speak French
Tom, you should come, too
Have you ever seen Tom laugh?
Is it OK to trust Tom?
Do you think we can trust Tom?
I've kept the best for last
Are you sure nobody's around?
It wasn't my proudest moment
That wasn't my proudest moment
Where have you been?
Don't sit on these boxes
Didn't you recognize me?
It doesn't rain here very much
We don't get much rain
That's one of my cats
Where are you originally from?
Don't send it to me anymore
Don't send it to me again
It's my decision!
It's my verdict!
I cannot touch-type
Why is Tom here?
Don't lock the door
Why do women love gifts?
Why do women love presents?
He's in beer
What don't you like again?
Mozambique?
Tom, you should go, too
How can I gain her trust?
How's everything with you?
How's life been treating you?
This shouldn't be possible
I can't help being fat
Why did you cut down the tree?
Did it bother you in some way?
I can't help eating too much
I can't help drinking
I just can't help smoking
Where did you buy that pen?
Destroy them!
I doubt that'll happen again
I don't want to kill anybody
That's a filthy lie
That's good for you
What is that on the wall?
Can you play chess well?
Can you play the piano well?
Can you play basketball well?
Can I rent ice skates?
Can we rent a rowboat?
I'll give up math
Don't tell that to my wife
Could you come and help?
We won't need money
What bird cannot fly?
Tom, have you eaten anything?
Where's a hairdresser?
Did you buy a car?
Settle down now!
Does Mary understand French?
And who's gonna stop us?
And who's going to stop us?
It's always cold in here
Bring me lemon tea, please
How old are you?
I'm 23 years old.
Learn to think positively!
You'll start right now
Here, take it!
I don't need it.
Don't walk on the grass!
There's a vase on the table
Here's my business card
Leave it to me, boss!
Is Mary's husband a general?
We'll make you happy
What are they doing?
They are playing something.
Mary turned everyone's head
Do you feel a little better?
Keep far away from him!
Stop, please
I'm going to buy it
Do you have to read?
Have you got anything to read?
You've got something to read
Will you help us to find him?
Do you believe in afterlife?
That's something that we made
That's something we made
I'm the one who made this
Don't cry in public
We're not allowed to swim here
She's pretty, but dangerous
Don't look over here
Avoid clichés
We're avoiding that subject
Why is she avoiding me?
May I lie down to rest a bit?
What's the dollar rate now?
What's the dollar rate today?
Who sent you there?
Set sail!
Make sail!
It's you who must thank me
What crossed your mind?
I'm not an enemy to myself
I'm afraid she has parotitis
it's already 10 hours p.m
Please, forget about this
Was the hypothesis confirmed?
I don't like chicken a lot
He's Italian
Stop talking bollocks!
I'll do whatever is necessary
What is the happiness of life?
Please, talk slower
Maybe there's another way?
Will you pick me up today?
Children shouldn't eat this
That's not being advertised
Tom isn't a ballplayer
What time did you leave?
What time did you arrive?
It's almost the same
Mary hasn't called yet
Are they English?
That's a pine tree
Hi, Tom
How are you?
Is 2:30 OK for you?
What a subtle hint!
Tom's tomcat is sick
Tom's tom is sick
Can you guys understand Tom?
Can you all understand Tom?
I'll do whatever is required
Does vacation ever begin?
At what time do you come home?
They don't want to sleep
I've done the same
He's looking at the map
That's a wonder of nature
This guy's dangerous
I'm fasting today
I'm awfully smart
Hurry up, breakfast is ready!
I'll go then!
You have to stay here!
I can't recognize it
She's fixing a car
Out of the way!
Is not that cool?
Are you giving up?
Come on, say it
Do you mean that seriously?
I can't say more
Oh, look at that
I like dogs, you know
Okay, that's enough for today
I'm sorry that it was so late
Do you like Italian cuisine?
Stop doing that!
Let's hang out again
I've never eaten clam
I'll definitely solve it
Does your mother smoke?
Do your parents smoke?
I already don't remember where
I don't care about costs
What Mary is so scared with?
I'm in despair!
Look, it's snow!
We're her children
Idiot, I'm talking seriously!
You're doing dishes
You're shorter than Tom
We're in a laboratory
She'll wash her hands
All the children are healthy?
Would you like an orange?
Do you guys want an orange?
It's not safe to stay here
You're far
They're doing a snow job on us
Where's US embassy?
What is a meteorite?
I couldn't find Mary's house
You broke it, you fix it
Is it worth fixing?
Where's the pen?
Is it sugar?
Is it salt?
How come she's got balls?
Mary isn't omnipotent
Mary isn't all-powerful
Mary doesn't want it
Mary doesn't put up with that

Is that sugar?
Is that salt?
I've never eaten clams
I've never eaten crab
I'm sorry that I was so late
I'm sorry I was so late
I didn't recognize it
It isn't safe to stay here
I'll do what's required
Did you really like Boston?
Don't tell my wife that
Tom is Mary's manager
That's what I used to think
What is on your mind?
He's always been that way
That's nuts
That's nuts," said Tom
Thanks, Tom
Thanks, Tom
Did you have fun today?
Czech koruny.
I'm not fond of chaos
Is her father in the garden?
I don't remember my first kiss
Tom was given an hour's notice
Don't worry
I'll fix everything
There's a small leak
Tom's house has a leaky roof
Can she speak English?
Are those real diamonds?
Have you written your will?
Tom's house has a hidden room
Where did he learn Esperanto?
That's a recipe for disaster
She's really high maintenance

He's at school
She's at school
It's at school
This restaurant is open 24/7
He's inside the school
She's inside the school
She isn't likely to come
I don't plan to stay very long
Did you lock the car?
I'm broke again
You didn't pay attention
You've been tortured
Where have they been for work?
In Africa.
I'm no longer on a diet
I'm not on a diet anymore
She's the best teacher
She's the best professor
Stop disturbing Tom now!
It’s impossible to relate them
You digress!
I don't care why Tom did it
I'm just glad he did it
I'll send you the book by mail
Please start up the motor, Tom
What a creep!
Do you have any ice cream?

I'll get on with my work
She's right
I'm laid-back
I wasn't disappointed at all
I'm being candid with you
I wasn't allowed to eat
I don't eat junk food
I saw my mother's face
I didn't take coaching classes
I'm in my mid forties
I'm ready to come out
I don't want her to be in pain
I'm here in the room
I'm in the corner
I'm recording
I didn't get mad at her
I don't want to hear her side
I didn't read anything
I'm so upset
I'm not interested in anything

I didn't talk to her
I saw her high-five him
I'm not with her
I didn't make her cry

I didn't hear her correctly
I didn't pay her
I didn't pay for her soda

Sugar isn't good for you
I didn't threaten her
I didn't punch her in the face

I don't talk to her
I didn't date her

Sami doesn't like French fries
Sami is in his parents' room
Sami doesn't like birds
Sami's mom is a teacher

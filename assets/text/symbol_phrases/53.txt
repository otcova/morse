Yanni passed Skura's house
Yanni didn't answer the door
Where do you think Yanni is?
I'm not too old to help
Let's say that it's true
She's sick.
Who?
The girl.
Which girl?
Yanni.
What do you mean?
It's a she.
Yes.
Yanni couldn't sleep
I'll have that
Is this your homework, Tom?
You're a nuisance
You're a pest
Yes, of course, I'll help you
It's just like 1984!
Is it really, though?
They're opening the window
Wow, this is just like 1984
Tom won't change himself
He he he, Tom is funny!
Is he, though?
Are pies hard to make?
One never knows what'll happen
Where is the black cat?
I'm too old for these things
Where did you buy that jacket?
Tom can't drive a car at all
Does that taste good?
I think it's not so bad
There's no need to hurry
There's no rush
Does your knee still hurt?
Tom's toothbrush is blue
Mary's is red
The blue toothbrush is Tom's
The red one's Mary's
I'll drive you to the bus stop
What does Tom want for lunch?
Is Tom a hard worker?
Tom has three dogs?
Do you keep your room clean?
What color is your pack?
It's not sunny today
It isn't sunny today
Close the window!
I'd like some feedback
Will you be here this evening?
I'll talk to Tom soon
Does Tom really hate Mary?
How are you paying?
Are you a carpenter?
Mary, look!
Ooh!
What's inside?
An engagement ring!
Why the Easter Bunny?
Oh!
Let me through, please
What did you do with your car?
I don't like the way he drives
Don't eat bacon at night
It's too greasy
That didn't seem to worry him
Is it safe to eat bacon raw?
Is it safe to eat raw bacon?
Don't be like that
It's not as bad as it looks
We don't want to stay alive
Is he an idiot?
You have no idea...
It's cold outside
What do you make in a month?
A large order of fries, please
What did you make for dinner?
What did you make Tom do?
When do we pause the video?
Don't feel bad for him
Are we stupid?
Are we idiots?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't have the chance.
She's the most faithful woman
Tom isn't as brave as he looks
I don't think he left
Why are you smiling?
Because I'm happy.
What's gotten you so sad?
Tom is red-haired today
Don't take it to heart
What's all the laughter about?
Are you a joiner?
Do you enjoy going to parks?
It's not too hot today
That's what we believe
Welcome to Berlin!
Did you have a good flight?
Good morning.
Coffee.
Yanni.
Yes.
My God...
Sorry, son.
He's really pressuring me
Who's your favorite violinist?
Are you Skura?
Yes.
Wow!
And you are?
Yanni.
I love this music.
Ane I love you.
What?
I said I love this music!
Yeah, and I love you!
What?
I can't hear you.
Turn the music down.
What did you say?
I said I love you.
Where were you?
What do you mean?
You've been with him again.
I didn't take your phone
Bring me some water.
I'm not your maid.
Clean this up.
Are you serious?
Clean this up.
I'm not your maid.
We need to talk.
We do?
Yes.
Skura," she replied
What's your name?
I'm Skura.
And I'm Yanni
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Yes.
Look, I've got enough problems
Next time, skip the intro
You said so yourself.
Never mind what I said.
You can't believe everybody
He's shaking his head
She's shaking her head
What are you thinking about?
By the way, of you.
I'll write down the address
I'll note the address
Kids can't say bad words
I'll steal a car
What's the worst-case scenario
I'm going to steal a car
See you on Monday!
Ask him when he'll be back
Ask him when he's coming back
Today, snow has to be cleared
That's not your notebook
It's his
Ask Tom when he's coming back
There's no water in this glass
There's still a lot left to do
Can I borrow your car today?
Could I borrow your car today?
May I borrow your car today?
Now we're adults
Who owns these books?
They're Alice's.
Ah!
How do you know that?
Why aren't you going to go?
When's the next bus?
You don't have to be sorry
Do you think ghosts are real?
When will you be moving?
Who's Tom's wife?
Who's Mary's husband?
Is Tom drunk already?
Let's go for a drive in my car
Don't pinch my cheeks
I'm sure of it
A guy, obviously
Yeah, you're right.
Your T-shirt has a stain on it
Where's your older brother?
Of course, it's not all bad
You'll find yourself alone
I'm aching for this dinner
Here's how we can help you now
Skura, I'm Yanni.
Sir!
Yes, madam.
That man is stalking me.
It's OK for you to use my desk
You're impossible to deal with
You should've seen that movie
Yanni's parents were pleased
Don't give in to temptation
That's depressing news
They were Yanni's kids
You'd better not stay up late
Yanni had self-esteem issues
You'd better close the window
Yanni can't be doing this
You're no more a god than I am
I saw Yanni's Volvo today
You're too young to be in love
Yanni doesn't have any money
Yanni's birthday is April 4th
You'll be shocked to hear this
What?
Is this a movie?
Yanni is divorcing Skura.
I don't believe my ears.
Yanni is divorcing Skura.
Please tell me you're joking.
Yanni is divorcing Skura.
No shit!
That's how soccer is
That's how football is
Could I borrow an umbrella?
Who switched the lights off?
Who turned the lights off?
How much was this umbrella?
Can I come down here to live?
Is Yanni back with Skura?
Which planet is the smallest?
Someone, open the door
It isn't that big of a deal
So, where are you guys going?
You're not seeing him again.
I love him.
I don't care.
That's how a lot of us feel
I've been fired again.
Again?
This car smells.
Yanni slept here last night.
Disgusting!
Yanni can't provide for Skura
Yanni is still on Skura's mind
Yes?
Yanni is with another woman.
Yes?
Yes?
Really?
Wait!
What are you doing?
Put the baby down!
Let go of me!
Help!
No!
Help!
Yanni couldn't control himself
Are there any witnesses?
Give me everything you have.
I don't have anything.
Shut up!
Give me your watch and phone!
Put the baby down, I said.
Put Yanni down.
What?
Put the baby down!
I'm used to it, anyways.
Put that baby down, I said!
What's this noise?
We should call the police.
911
What's your emergency?
I've been shot.
Where are you, sir?
I don't know
I've been shot.
Can you describe the place?
I've been shot!
It's time for Yanni to stop
How to prevent infidelity?
Tom wasn't buying any of it
Anakin doesn't like sand
I don't like frying eggs
I don't like to fry eggs
Yanni's business was booming
I need you to sign this.
What is it?
He's all ears
Tom didn't buy his bicycle
Let's buy Tom a tennis racket
I'm buying food for Tom
Why did Tom buy these flowers?
Why did Tom buy this one?
Don't worry
I didn't buy that
Others think it's time to sell
Money won't buy you happiness
We don't have to buy it today
I won't buy Tom anything
Why hasn't Tom bought one yet?
I've never bought a new car
Why did Tom buy that one?
Did you remember to buy a map?
They're all sold out now
Tom isn't going to buy that
I won't buy that brand anymore
Let's buy Tom a bicycle
Do you recommend buying gold?
Did Tom buy orange juice?
Yes, but who gives a damn?
Are you happy?
I am indeed.
We don't need to buy anything
We couldn't buy what we needed
Let's buy Tom a pony
Feelings aren't facts
We're buying food for Tom
That's a ridiculous rumor
That's a ridiculous demand
I'd like to buy a pair
Let's buy Tom a dog
Don't buy too much candy
Money can't buy you happiness
Let's buy one for Tom, too
Did Tom buy you something?
Is this on sale?
I'm just giving my perspective
This is fake, misleading news
It's full of paranoids
Let's buy a pony for Tom
I won't buy anything for Tom
It's full of paranoia
I'm buying this for Tom
Please, call Tom
Let's buy a dog for Tom
Why did Tom buy this car?
Tom didn't want to buy it
What did Tom buy there?
That's what we need to buy
Why did Tom buy so much?
What does Tom want to buy?
Why did Tom buy one of those?
Raising children isn't easy
That's not something I'd buy
I wouldn't buy one of those
That isn't something I'd buy
Maybe I'll buy it from you
That's something I still do
Would you sell this to me?
I'd like to buy this
What do you sell here?
Do you sell shovels here?
Can I buy a rake here?
These don't sell very well
It's hard to sell these
We don't sell wine here
Why did Tom sell his farm?
Who did Tom sell his farm to?
When did Tom sell his farm?
This isn't ready to sell yet
These aren't hard to sell
That's what I'm calling about
Close your eyes.
Why?
Open your eyes now.
What's this?
Would you marry me?
Of course!
I have some good news.
What?
You're gonna be a daddy.
What if it's a girl?
We're gonna name her Skura.
He's working on it.
Where can I buy a toaster?
Yanni shot Skura.
Yes, I know
It was an accident.
Yanni was a generous guy.
That was the Yanni I knew.
Yanni forged Skura's signature
I love you.
Skura wasn't quite feminine
Where are you going?
Come back here!
Who told you that?
911
What's your emergency?
There has been a shooting!
Fine, sir
What is the address?
One of Yanni's friends left
Tom's books sell quite well
He's sprained an ankle
Yanni was DNA-tested
What drove Yanni to murder?
Why does Tom want to sell it?
Come on, get up
Yanni explored Skura's website
We don't sell stuff like that
Tom didn't sell anything
Don't sell any of my stuff
I don't want to sell this
We've stopped selling those
These things don't sell well
Who was chosen?
We don't sell beer here
Tom, would you help me?
Me?
Are you out of your mind?
Of course not.
You're selling yourself short
Me massaging your feet?
Never!
Who did you choose?
Who did they choose?
He will get him's
Don't stand up to me!
Is it easy to sell cosmetics?
He's crazy in love with her
Get it out of your mind!
Keep calm!
Stay on guard!
What are you good at doing?
There's been a massive change
Don't come before six o'clock
Don't come before 2:30
I don't envy you your job
I'm envious of your strength
I'm envious of your talent
I envy Tom's luck
I envy Tom's good luck
Tom envied Mary's luck
Tom envied Mary's good luck
Tom envied Mary's good fortune
Tom envied Mary's patience
I envy Tom's abilities
I envy Tom's lifestyle
I envy Tom's way of living
I envy Tom's way of life
Tom envied Mary's faith
I can't say that I envy them
I envy Tom's good fortune
What's your alternative plan?
I envy Tom's job
I envy Tom's position
Tom doesn't envy Mary
Tom envies Mary's success
Have you ever won a contest?
I don't envy your life
There'll be no change
Tom told me Mary couldn't swim
I'll leave the talking to you
I can't say I envy them
Are you already vaccinated?
It's hotter than usual tonight
You are a coward!
Where are the eggs, please?
You suck dude!
I have to tell you everything!
You didn't tell him anything?
Why can't we tickle ourselves?
The entrée includes a beverage
I'll pay by cheque
Who said that?
It's totally wrong!
You can't expect much of him
You wrote this book?
Mr. Hashimoto is fair to us
Bite down tightly, please
Do you have lunch at school?
We've got to hurry
Hurry up!
Taking a little time off?
Will Mr Oka teach English?
The number of guests is 20
Smoking or non-smoking?
Take your time, Yoshida
Let's carry on the discussion
Please address the chair!
Without a doubt!
I don't need fake friends
Do get up, it's very late
You're her daughters
Don't go against the rules
I didn't know you cared!
Beware!
There's a car coming!
Like it?
Let's straighten out the desk
Whose is the book on the desk?
I'll do it with pleasure
Shall I call the doctor?
Correct errors, if any
You'd better believe
To be on time, I ran
Do you care for sweets?
Teach me some kanji, please
Can other people catch it?
It being cold, we made a fire
A pleasant trip to you!
Let's sing some merry songs
Do you have a student fare?
Do you take in students?
Here's my student ID
It's a shortcut to the school
When does school break up?
Don't tell tales out of school
Like water off a duck's back
Do you have any coughing?
Can I sleep out?
Get out, or you will be sorry
Is the picture straight?
Low-lying lands will flood
Let's drive as far as the sea
The monster's smile was cruel
Can you fix the broken radio?
Don't talk around it
The meeting closed at four p.m
We are a peace-loving nation
It'll get inflamed
Don't look back on your past
The fire took 13 lives
They're like peas in a pod
We're goin' home
In summer, eggs soon go bad
For how many nights?
How many people in your party?
How many people?
Two o'clock would be good.
What time can I be there?
What time shall we make it?
What are you talking about!?
What shall I go in?
What are you about?
What shall we play?
Above all, don't tell a lie
Above all, be true to yourself
Above all, we must be healthy
Don't cry before you're hurt
What are you working for?
What a fine day it is!
How well she is singing!
How serious I looked!
How blue the sky is!
How fast the plane is!
What a heavenly dress!
Hmmm, how shall I say this?
What led you to believe it?
How naughty you are!
Stop bothering me!
What an ambiguous expression!
Say, he is no more than a kid
Are there any landmarks?
Do you have anything hot?
I'd like something light
Have you got any baggage?
Do you hear any sound?
Can't we use a simile here?
What made you so dissatisfied?
What shall I do for you?
Is anything up?
Did you do your homework?
How do I fix the volume?
The thermometer reads 10C
Don't make light of me
Alone in this world I'll be
I've got something on you
Be my right-hand man
I am a lucky budgie, aren't I?
It's you I'll always love
I'd rather go by train
I've never been beyond Okayama
Don't cut in with your remarks
Round trip or one-way?
May I take your size, madam?
How is the wife?
May I use your pencil?
Have you got a pencil?
Can you see far?
You'd better break off smoking
I'd like to see a play
Do you have any information?
Where is the sanitary section?
Must I speak English?
Where is English spoken?
Must I answer in English?
You're going to a movie?
What hours is it open?
What are the business hours?
Can I do exercises?
Take your chance, and do it
The rain's letting up soon
It being rainy, I stayed home
It's beginning to rain
If only the rain would stop!
I can't stretch my right arm
My face is swollen!
Penny wise, pound foolish
Penny-wise and pound-foolish
I'll fix you up for the night
I feel so lucky!
Who ever can it be?
Whatever is that noise?
What ever do you want with me?
Who can read the future?
Shall I go together with you?
In a word, she isn't any use
In a word, it's ridiculous
Shall I go for the doctor?
I didn't use to smoke
I've been to Hokkaido before
Give me some skin!
Accept a person's love
Have you ever visited Rome?
Where do I return cars?
What's the fare to Liverpool?
I'm often half-asleep
How dare you behave so rudely!
Of course, you may
Have you met him already?
It's 7:30 now
I'm done up
I'll deal out three to each
Be quiet Mie," said Mother
Soon after, it began to rain
Not again!
I can't watch this any more
I'm working for McDonald's
Did you hear that, Mike?
Look!
I'd like a hotel reservation
What track for Boston?
Have you ever gone to Venice?
Do we dress formal?
How fast Bill runs!
I'd like to go to Hawaii
Can I go out to play, Dad?
How do you do, Mrs. Allen?
I'm pleased to meet you
Yes, I can
Yes, I'm coming!
Love to party!
Suddenly, the rain fell
How's the weather in New York?
How it blows!
What a piece of folly!
What a cheerful story!
How hot it is!
What heavenly weather!
What a haughty fellow he is!
Oooh, sick!
What is that stuff?
It's all spongy
What are nabemono like?
Why does he look black?
Why did he stop smoking?
Why is it called "loon"?
Why?
Why are you panting so?
Me?
I'm a plain old salaryman
Don't yield to any temptation
I wouldn't do it for the world
Come first, talk later
How fast Tom works!
Tommy, can you hear me?
What lies are truth?
How long will it stop there?
Let's hope for the best anyway
It's too late, anyhow
Anyway, please come in
He's very forgetful of things
Cold as it was, we went out
It's a very becoming dress
Just the same!
Whichever wins, I'll be happy
Which side is batting?
What place did you see?
What papers do you take?
Where would I find T-shirts?
On what account?
I almost think you're right
How can I pick out fresh fish?
Finally, my sister got engaged
Finally, my sister got married
May you live long!
How can we abolish war?
What makes him hated?
How can I jump so high?
How come you say nothing?
How did you come to know it?
How come you are here?
Why do you take such a risk?
What do you learn Spanish for?
Anyhow, don't make me one
Pray forgive me!
Oh, don't watch television
Don't keep the TV on!
Enough TV, already!
When did TV appear?
But maybe guys don't like them
But, I have to take my mother
But you will write, won't you?
But you like it!
But you're going to owe me one
See you tonight, then
Cheers!
Then who are you?
Are you Elijah?
This weekend, if possible
That is, she is a poor dancer
That is to say, on May 10th
At last, we reached England
At last, Ken achieved his goal
Finally, Oedipus replied
Can you spare a minute?
I'll make you some
Hey, you
Want to hear something funny?
Don't hesitate
Don't be mean with the tip
Check in, please
Whose go is it?
Somebody's on the porch!
Who is in fault?
Who can put a bell on the cat?
Do you mind my smoking?
You are wrong, however
Can I dial directly?
Can I use your typewriter?
Hotshot!
Don't tell me off like that
That can't be right
I don't give a damn about it
At that, he stood up
Will you carry it out for me?
Does it bark at her?
It waited, silently
Is it fine gold?
That's my province
It's your stereotyping
How long it is!
It's a very slow business
That is no fault of Jack's
Does that include breakfast?
That means sure death!
There!
She comes!
Does the medicine act quickly?
Don't play ball in this room
The man, Oedipus, trembled
Don't make fun of that child
Don't force the child to eat
Let's call the dog Skipper
What happened in consequence?
Air those shoes!
Keep straight on!
Will you play the tape?
I'd like to keep the car there
Jesus' mother was there
Well, when exactly?
Yes, well, that depends
Well, I bake bread
Well, I watch television
Do keep practicing!
I felt, like, "What the ...?
Sorry?
Pardon?
Sorry, I can't accommodate you
Did Spot go, too?
What a gorgeous bash!
I'd like to try out skydiving
Go in and win!
Can I stop over in Chicago?
To San Francisco, please
Sam, don't!
Now, said Mr Wood
Satan's ghost awakes
Welcome to Cyberspace!

Whose are these shoes?
Will this button hold?
Is this bench firm?
Can you fix this door?
It's creaking
Is this typewriter available?
The cake tastes divine!
Whose is this camera?
Where is this?

You're enjoying yourself
My sides ache, doctor
Good night, sleep tight
Well, I declare!

When did you buy the watch?
When did you miss the purse?
When did you go to Rome?
Wherever, wherever I am

No, I went out
No, no, my dear
No, not too much

Actually, it was just a rumour
As it is, I can not pay you
Don't touch
Get your hands off!
Where is the way out?
I will join it!
How was the attendance?
Do you like spring or autumn?
Well begun, well finished
Long live the Queen!

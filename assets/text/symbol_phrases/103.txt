I'm too tired to walk any more
As I was tired, I took a rest
I'm getting older and tired
Are you tired?
Can you keep it a secret?
Have you figured out the cost?
I don't care about the expense
I don't use birth control
Where's the emergency exit?
You shouldn't skip in reading
We'll fly there in 50 minutes

Call me any time, if necessary
If necessary, I will come soon

How many samples?
May I have an ice bag?
Will the ice bear our weight?
Would you like ice?
Don't be cold as ice
If you heat ice, it melts
It's the tip of the iceberg
As long as it doesn't freeze!
Heads I win, tails you win
Heads or tails?
Don't go outside
It's raining hard
I'd like a room in the front
Live up to one's reputation
Where is the hospital shop?
Oh, I was ill
I've heard you've been sick
Are you sick?
If he is not ill, he will come
He's sick and was hospitalized
Being poor, he can't buy it
Don't look down on poor people
Don't look down on the poor
Don't make a fool of the poor
What if I am poor?
I'm anemic
Don't be ashamed of being poor
I'm not ashamed that I am poor
It's all but impossible
I'm afraid I'm frigid
We're in store for a recession
It's not fair!
I have to do the hard work!

Read "Gone With The Wind
It's a windy day
It's blowing very hard
I can't shake off my cold
It's just a cold
Don't catch a cold
How is your cold?
How's your cold?
I've gone and caught a cold
I've caught a cold
I'm a little feverish

Keep down, or you'll be shot
Is there any adverse reaction?
How wide is it?
Have you finished dressing?
Is there a dress code?
Let's drop in on the Fukudas
I'm so hungry, I ate it
When angry, count to ten
Let's talk turkey!
Don't lose your temper
Don't get angry
I'd like to get a refund
How do I get reimbursed?
I'm not sure I can afford it
Don't leave things half done
Don't do things by halves
Physics be hanged!
You see?
You see?
Do you hear me?
I got it, OK?
I know but I can't help it
Do you follow?
We'd like to split it
Can I buy it on easy payment?
Don't complain about that
You've asked for it
Don't complain
Don't complain
Listen to this!
You know what?
Don't ask
Want to know?
I'm all ears
I can't hear it
Do you read me?
I can't hear you
Don't climb up the wall
You'll be OK

Now I have 21!
Can I get you another one?
Give me a rain-check
I've found another job
I wish I'd married another man
Let's think out another way
That's strange
That's weird
Strange my foot!
Is everything OK?
You changed it?
Talk to me!
Can't think of an answer?
Study!
Don't study
Study or don't--it's up to you
I don't feel like studying

Could you find me an attorney?
I'd like to replace it
Insure it, please
I'm sorry, Doctor
How much is the premium?
Got it!
He's like an eel

It's a short walk
How long does it take on foot?
Shall we walk or drive?
Let's talk as we go along
Shall we walk or take the bus?
Shall we walk?
Is it too far to walk?
How is your life?
Unlike her mother, she is tall
Do you have anything in mind?
I'm dying to see my mother
If anything, she looked worse
When will Mother come home?
My mother didn't mention it
Mom didn't look calm enough
My mother can't ride a bicycle
I talked to my heart's content
Mother has old-fashioned ideas
I'm breast-feeding my baby
You don't have to wrap it up
Have you sent in your report?
You're choking me
What do you do after school?
Let's play tennis after school
Are you free after school?
Where is your mother, boy?
Don't fail to lock the door
Don't forget to count me in
Don't forget to add me in
Don't forget to sign your name
Don't forget to call me
Do you have everything?
As I am busy, I cannot go
Staying busy and crazy!!
I've got no time for that now
I'm tied up at the office
A ruffian's pistol went off
Don't resort to violence
I've never been to Hokkaido
I'm going to climb Mt
I'm as hungry as a horse
What if I say "no"?
I'll pay the bill
Don't worry
I'll stay with you
I'll do the shooting
I'll admit I'm wrong
It's not my fault
I'll hide and you find me
OK?
I'll take over your job
I'll take back all I said
I'll cover for you
I'm right
I'll take care of the bill
I'll see to it
Our class consists of 40 boys
We dined at our uncle's
We are staying at our uncle's
I'm a bit of a reader myself
You're the apple of my eye
Tom can hang tough, I am sure
Can you give me a house?
She's my classmate
Don't interfere in my affairs
Don't stand by me
Where's my box of chocolates?
My car's in the shop
I can't find my pen
Don't find fault with me
How my poor heart aches!
Do you know my brother Masao?
The way I see it, he is right
Do you know what I mean?
Don't tell on me
My sister hit the jackpot!
Do you love me?
Do you know where my watch is?
Where is my watch?
Don't laugh at my failure
You won't find my weak point
May I leave my homework here?
You can't run my life
Can you hear I'm calling?
That's not what I heard
Did you mention my book?
I'm sure about his name
I'm not tired at all
I took Highway 58
I can't leave work until five
I am to meet her on Platform 8
I can't play tennis very much
I'm always looking at you
Oh, I didn't like the ending
Could you deal with it?
I'm off cigarettes for good
I can't walk any further
I'm going to change my shirt
I'm bad at sports
I think that it's true
I'm so happy
I'm as tall as Tom
How foolish I am!
Suddenly, my feet stopped
I've got to go now
I'm fed up with math
I'm a country boy now
It's all up with me
Didn't you?
I'll stay home
I'm patient
I have a sweet-tooth
I'm wrong, am I not?
I don't quite agree with you
I'm your flatmate Paul
I don't subscribe to your idea
I support you whole-heartedly
I've been looking for you
I'm never late for school
I'm going to fly to the moon
I'm being patient
I'll be on duty this Sunday
I'm left-handed
I'm getting sick of the ride
I'm young
I've come here to help you
I don't mind hot weather
I'm not very good at swimming
I'm going to give up math
I asked him point-blank
I'll get in
I don't go by what he says
I can't trust in his word
I can't think of his name
I'm walking beside her
I'm angry with her
I'll be watching you
I mean what I'm saying
I'm a night owl
I'll join in ten minutes
Me, too
I'm in the same boat
May I join you?
When can we eat?
We weren't aware of the time
He doesn't like us
Can I take books out?
I'd like a book
Have you ever written a book?
Don't eat while reading
I don't have time to read
Did you take back the books?
I mean it!
Do you mean what you say?
Do you really mean it?
Do you really love me?
You can't be serious
I'll get even with you!
Oh, really?
When did he leave?
Do you?
Why?
Really?
Did you ever?
Is that true?
It's such a nice change
You're really absent-minded
It's so lovely a day
I'm really up a tree
I'm terribly sorry
Oh, I'm terribly sorry
You can't be so sure
Is it really the case?
I don't really care that much
Can you handle it?
I'm really confused
He's really selfish
We can't really throw it away!
It's really hot there
In fact, he is a nice fellow
What are you serving today?
I'll give you anaesthesia
I'll make it up for you
How's your sister?
My sister did not say "Hello.
Is it this hot every day?
Don't stay up late every night
Can I get a pillow?
I'm very glad to see you again
Should it be fine, I will go
If he should be busy, help him
Workers of the world, unite!
It can't be helped
Fill it up, please
How about the taste?
Could I have a sample taste?
Hey, there's no pulse
I'm sleepy!
Are you sleepy?
No wonder I'm sleepy
As I was sleepy, I went to bed
Aren't you sleepy?
Feeling sleepy, I went to bed
Are you sleeping, Tom?
I'm a light sleeper
I couldn't sleep
I'm trying to sleep
It's like a dream come true
I can't open the pantry
Where is the missing dollar?
It's useless to try and resist
Don't waste your money
Don't waste your breath
I shouldn't have overdone it
Don't work too hard!
I'm not asking for the moon
Don't exert yourself
I don't wanna press you
It's for free
Is it free?
The girls' chatter was endless
Can my daughter go to school?
What's the stop after Nagoya?
I'm seeing all the sights
Don't chase after fame
Did you hear your name called?
What's its name?
Life's seed is laid
Will you turn on the light?
I can't reach the transom
Obviously, he is lying
Clearly, the rumor is not true

May I have a blanket?
Beware of the dog!
There were few, if any, trees
Wood floats, but iron sinks
Hold your tongue!
Shut up and listen!
You needn't suffer in silence
Shut up, or I'll knock you out
I'm frantic!
When I awoke, it was snowing
Out of sight, out of mind
I met a keen-eyed guy
I'm awake
I can't keep my eyes open
Open your eyes, please
Wake up!
Close your eyes, please
Don't shut your eyes
Don't ignore your subordinates
At present, he is in Canada
My alarm clock didn't work
That's why I was late
I'd like to buy eye drops
Don't give yourself airs
I'll return to get my handbag
Is something wrong?
Is there a curfew?
A saint's maid quotes Latin
Night coming on, we went home
Toward midnight, I fell asleep
Do you offer any night tours?
It's eight o'clock at night
It's supposed to rain at night
The sun doesn't shine at night
Don't sit up late
Don't sit up late at night
Don't call me so late at night

Do you believe in fairies?
Where can Yoko have gone?
She's studying English
Take care!

Have a cigar?
In brief, he was careless
In short, he was too honest

In a word, I don't trust him

Where have those six got to?
They've escaped.
I'm his father.
Eh?
Where's Keiko?
Cool, isn't he?
Rather, pretty boy?
Hand over the money, Yo!
You boasting?
Or complaining?
Just a normal get together.
Strange isn't it
I have to pee.
Say, 'Excuse me
I need to go to the toilet.'
Kai dear!
I'm really sad!
Eh?
Skip-ping-town.
'Fox's wedding'.
Er ...?
Pretty gem, isn't it?

Rock-paper-scissors, OK?
Rock.
Sciss... paper.
You cheated!

What does that tell me?
That's right
Wait a mo!
Why are you here!?
'Why' is obvious isn't it?
Eh!
Oh?
What's up with that?
What was that person saying?
Er?
No, sorry
I'm just sulking a bit.
That's right
Sexy isn't it?
Feeling horny?

Thank you.
How did it go?
So it's built from stone?
What is she saying?
You don't even know 'norito'?
Norito?
I was asked, "You OK, kid?
I replied, "Fine.
I'm not sleeping
I'm always just skiving off.
That way's even worse!
Look!
Oh?
No, not so much
Sizes of what?
Of 'that'.
Ha-ha-ha-hah!
No worry!
Whoa, hold up a mo!
I've heard all about it!
It wasn't passionate!
That's an exaggeration...
W-why?
If it's a light workout, OK.
Does your back hurt?
No, not really.
Don't look alike do you?
It's the age of BL!
Bee el?
Yup, Boys' Love
Short tempered as ever.

Did I make a joke?
Why don't you leg it?

Now, please don't get so angry
My what a narrow waist!
Good grief!
I won't have it!
I haven't decided either way
Don't multi-post, idiot
Oh, you!
Enough!
Could you repeat that?
No, couldn't be
It wasn't his fault
No, no
All for one, and one for all
That's team play
If not a lie, close to a boast
Can I extend my stay?

What is political science?
Him, honest?
What a joke!
Quiet!
She's weak, powerless
That was the P-wave just now
The S-wave is coming
I can't leave this to others
What if you make yourself ill?
It'll be fine, you can do it!
Trust yourself!
I know!
Ow!
Yukiko!
That hurts!
Miss Tanaka!
Thus 'ding-ding-train'
They don't get along together

How are you?
Fine, thank you.
I won't close the door
Do I need to say more?
Don't be so serious!
I don't know any blind people
I'm leaving, goodbye!
Have you gone crazy?

I'm the one who met him
Is the weather beautiful?
I can't speak German at all
I didn't ask you that
I didn't ask you, Tom
I didn't buy the car

I didn't get home until 2:30
I didn't have to tell Tom

I didn't know where else to go
I didn't think you were coming
I admire Tom's perseverance

I admired Tom's work
I admit that it's strange
I agree that's a possibility
I already know you're crazy
I already said I'm not going
I already think you're crazy
I always knew you'd be back
I answered all Tom's questions
I apologize for Tom's behavior
I asked Tom where he'd gone
I asked Tom where he'd been
She still thinks we're friends
He still thinks we're friends
Tom still thinks we're friends
He didn't keep his word
She didn't keep her word
It's technically illegal
He's not my boyfriend!
I'm going to be late for class
Do you like blue cheese?
I'm not going to school today
I assume it was Tom's idea
I assume that's a joke
I assume you know why I'm here
I assume you've had breakfast
I assume you've read my report
I just assumed you'd be here
I assure you this isn't a joke
I attended Tom's funeral
I'm going on a business trip

But that's absurd
The Berlin Wall fell in 1990
Goodbye, cruel world
It's much better now
I haven't seen him in years
He's a prisoner of war

Should I ask her out?
Should I ask him out?

Do you like this?
He's not here
I'm not here
Why did you abandon me?
He wants children, but I don't
Do you like thunderstorms?
I blame Tom's friends
Why is he so nice to me?
Why is she so nice to me?
I still haven't eaten
I called Tom's parents
Let me tell it!
I know that he's reading
I came at Tom's request
I came to say I'm sorry
I came to see how you're doing
It's a good one, I think
There's some truth to it
Why is he being so nice to me?
There's no speed limit
There's a sauna and a pool
I can be there in 30 minutes
I can feel Tom's pain
I can feel Tom's presence
Who will be the next pope?
I need a taxi!
It's thundering outside
I'm really scared!
I can handle this, no problem
I can meet you at 2:30
I can see I'm not needed here
I can see I've lost you
I can see Tom's point

Idiot..
How many accounts do you have?
He's a bleeding-heart liberal
She's a bleeding-heart liberal
I'm no bleeding-heart liberal
Funny..

What you said is wrong.
Then what should I say?
I'm all washed up
When will you be online?
You get out of class?
I wasn't talking
He's paraplegic
She's quadriplegic
Are you having fun?

It was beginner's luck
She's proud to be a Catholic
I'm in the toilet
It's all right
What time is class for you?
Dinner's ready already
When are you going to be home?
When are you getting off work?
How about you?
He's closed-minded
It's a drop in the bucket
I'd like a shrimp cocktail
She's an art historian
He's a limousine driver
Is this a compliment?
Is it a compliment?
She's older than you think
She's younger than you think
He's older than you think
He's younger than you think
You were wrong.
Yes, but I was almost right.
She's playing Sims 3
Why are you crying?
It's just a movie!
It's best not to ask
It's sad, but true
Do you hear what I'm saying?
I'm not your boyfriend
It was just a hookup.
What?
We're beautiful together
You're a stunning couple
Don't be such a curmudgeon!
Did you buy that book?
I don't work tomorrow
I didn't work yesterday
Are you Catholic?
She's texting her boyfriend
She stole my boyfriend!
Are you blind?
Are you trying to seduce me?
What do we have to lose?
What do I have to lose?
He's my hero
You're still up?
You're still awake?
I'm pretty hungry
When can we go have lunch?
Hopefully I'll pass
Why is my memory so bad?
I'm always forgetting things!
I'm sick, and it's miserable!
That's not the point
Let's reconsider the problem
Are you still up?
You shouldn't forget to sleep
Stupid question, stupid answer
Did you go shopping?
Come on, drinks are on me
He's the same age as me
I'm free in ten minutes
How many apples, then?
I came to take Tom's place
I caught a fish!
I checked Tom's pulse
I confiscated Tom's knife
I could be there by 2:30
I could've helped you
I could've married Tom
I could have saved Tom's life
I couldn't stand any longer
I couldn't ask Tom for money
I couldn't ask you to do that

She's in love with another man
I'm just trying to help
He didn't return my calls
She didn't return my calls
Dear brothers and sisters!
That's what he said
It's common courtesy
I didn't steal it
I didn't steal it
Did I wake you up?
Did I wake you up?
Yes, you did!
He's away for the weekend
She's away for the weekend
I didn't like either of them
What do you want?
She's very childish
It doesn't mean you're gay
It's a type of body piercing
It didn't hurt at all
It didn't really hurt
It's a form of rebellion
What the fuck did you say?
I'm in bed
Is he working tomorrow?
When did you tell me?
Hurry up!
Can I write it that way?
Can I write it like that?
He wears a 6 gauge earring
I don't care what people think
I don't care what you think
It's not possible to stop here
How did you get here so fast?
We ate surf 'n' turf
I don't hate her
I don't hate him
She's very shy
He's very shy
I'm very shy
He's very straightforward
What did you eat this evening?
Where is the food?
I'm not like you!
I'm not like Tom!
He's not like Tom!
She's not like Mary!
I'm not like Mary!
What did you eat this morning?
Did you buy tomatoes?
Sorry, I made a mistake
How do you prepare this dish?
Where is the road?
Where is the taxi?
Where is the restaurant?
Where is the dining room?
Where is the bedroom?
Where is the store?
Where is Manila?
My client wants to testify.
And say what?
That he’s innocent.
I’ll argue the motion.
He got a T.R.O
Motion for T.R.O. denied
Objection, your honor
The defense rests, your honor
There’s no proof of anything!
There’s no proof of that
That was your cross?
It’s not exactly a trial
It’s an evidentiary hearing
I crashed Tom's party
I decided I'd take a chance
Right, let's start our work
They are open 24 hours a day
Could you go there and get it?

I didn't think I'd be welcome
I didn't think it was possible
I didn't think it was so bad
I didn't want to see Tom again
Can you taste the garlic?
She wears a size 13 shoe
I do think it's possible
I do trust you, Tom
I do what I'm told
Can I eat this cake?
Don't work so much
French isn't an easy language
I'll stay here until tomorrow
It's a bit cold today
This CD is mine, isn't it?
This isn't a hospital
This watch doesn't work
Tom didn't read the book
What do you eat for lunch?

I don't believe in coincidence
I don't care about any of that
I don't care how long it takes
I don't care how you do it
I don't care if you go or not
I'm going anyway
I don't care what anyone says
I don't care what it cost
I don't care what Tom says
I'm not going
I don't care what Tom thinks
I don't care where Tom is
I don't care who we give it to
I don't care why Tom did it
I'm just glad he did
I don't care why you're late
I don't drink before noon
I don't enjoy riddles
I don't ever want to hurt you
I don't feel much like dancing
I don't feel much like eating
I don't feel much like talking
I don't go out much anymore
I don't have a choice
I don't have a credit card
I don't have a crush on Mary
I don't have a lot of options
I don't have a son named Tom
I don't have any nice clothes
I don't have any time to waste
I don't have much time left
I don't have that kind of time
I don't have time for a walk
I don't have time for this now
I don't know how to do that
I don't know if I can stay
I don't know Tom that well
I don't know what I owe you
I don't know what that means
I don't know what Tom wanted
I don't know where I'd begin
I don't know where Tom is
I don't know who you are
I don't know why it happened
I don't know your name
I don't like doctors
I don't like your smile
I don't recall saying that
I don't recognize the sound
I don't require assistance
I don't shave my legs
I don't take orders from you
I don't think Tom likes me
I don't understand this at all
I don't understand women
I don't want to see Tom again
Do you speak Filipino?
Do you speak Tagalog?
I don't have to listen to this
I don't have to listen to you
I don't have to say a word
I don't have to talk to you
I don't have to think about it
I don't keep secrets from Tom
I don't know how they do it
I don't know how to do it
I don't know how to do this
I don't know how to help Tom
I don't know Tom personally
I'm not like her!
I'm not like him!
He's afraid of intimacy
She's afraid of abandonment
She's anorexic
He's anorexic
You're delusional
He's completely delusional
She's completely incompetent
I don't do it anymore
I'm a volleyball player
What would you want to eat?
What would you want to drink?
Love is patient, love is kind
It's your turn now
I'm not waking you up
He's washing your car
I don't evacuate them
An appendectomy, please
Is it your helicopter?
Ouch!
My tooth!
We weren't cold
I don't know how to reach you
I don't know how you did it
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if Tom can help
No more cookies!
I don't know Boston that well
I don't know French that well
I don't know much about that
I don't know what came over me
I don't know what else to try
I don't know what I did wrong
I don't know what the truth is
I don't know what to call you
I don't know what to do here
I don't know what Tom will say
I don't know when I'll be back
I don't know when Tom left
I don't know where my keys are
I don't know
Where can I hire a car?

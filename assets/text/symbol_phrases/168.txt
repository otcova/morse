How much is it worth to you?
How much is too much?
How much longer do we have?
How much longer will it be?
How much luggage can we take?
How much money does Tom have?
How much more do we need?
How much rest do you need?
How much time did we lose?
How much time do I have?
How much time do you have?
How much time do you need?
How much time does it take?
How much time does Tom have?
How much time is left?
How much time will you need?
How much was it?
That's pointless
What is this?
Who is that?
Can we meet?
Let's leave it as it stands
It's still obscure to me
What's your native language?
Mari?
I don't believe myself
I'm a hopeless man
I'll read more attentively
You've achieved a lot
But that's not the point
You're both very polite
A mistery is what's not clear
You're polite as fuck!
One eye sleeps, the other sees
Does she understand Italian?
There he goes!
That's pointless!" cut Pride
Take a try..." whispered Dream
Fuck it all" replied Laziness
Bob's your uncle
Y ain't ya axed 'bout dat?
I've made a correction
I'm using a private teacher
I'm using a tutor
We weren't given homework
I don't want to suffer
How did I know?!
It's cold here
Stop right there, Tom
When was your last day off?
It's pure escapism
Why do you want to talk to me?
How could you know that?
You're not very good at it
I'm happy with what I have
This is about you, isn't it?
This isn't about you, Tom
He thinks it's a waste of time
I think it's a waste of time
You never told me that!
Yes, I did!
What are you doing down here?
What are you doing up there?
It's a good school
That's very considerate of you
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Ha hasn't confessed yet
Who is your enemy?
Where is your friend?
I won't drink any more!
I'm learning languages for fun
How much money have you got?
We aren't as good as you
We're the only ones here
It's going to break her heart
He's sweet and caring
There's no one around
I'm sorry
Is more always better?
What year is this?
It's very kind of you
He's 6'3" and I'm 5'10
She's a plus-sized model
She's blond and slim
Tom lives off-campus
Are there any volunteers?
Thank you, everybody
Wow, that line is huge!
Mary is a plus-sized model
Where's my brush?
We speak low german, do you?
When's dinner?
Who ordered pizza?
Who's the pizza for?
You're going to be jealous
Tomorrow's a new day
He's urinating blood
>" means greater than
Is this restaurant open?
Does this fit?
How do you do it?
I'll never be your whore
So I was right?
Go to school and study!
Sudden..
I definitely don't know them
You're the reason I came
Emet doesn't like that woman
Can one eat this mushroom?
What noise do giraffes make?
I'd like to go a bit slower
I'd like to walk a bit slower
Look away for a minute!
Hey, why is the window open?
Are you happy, Tom?
Yes, I am.
If you are, then so am I.
And if you are, Mary, so am I.
Of course!
When would be good for you?
I wish I had an 80-yen stamp
Where were you?
I think I'm going to faint
In Japan, it's now 3:00 a.m
I'm always in a fucking hurry
I'm busy all the fucking time
Haven't you been to Tahiti?
You what?
I never thought about that!
Who's that sleeping?
Professor Lupin.
How does she know everything?
Why?
The date today is 11.12.13
Has Tom lost his reason?
If there were what to lost...
The cannon!
They're loading the cannon!
Why?
Ah!
They're going to shoot!
I feel like I've been cheated
Don't let yourself be cheated!
We hoped we'd succeed today
Fuck neutrality!
Hope you've enjoyed your bath!
Are you a man or a woman?
Do you live there?
How did you get in here?
When will you be back home?
What time will you be back?
Who do you think did this?
Do we have any clean spoons?
God save Ukraine!
Is it OK to eat this mushroom?
It's OK to eat anything once.
Can I eat this mushroom?
You can eat anything one time.
What am I on about?
I'm on my way
Where was I?
I don't live in this city
I don't live in that city
You're a threat to our mission
Can you talk to me?
Stupidity is not a disability!
I haven't used this very much
Tomorrow I'm going back home
I'm going back home tomorrow
I couldn't call you
It's normal to make mistakes
I'm sure I've never seen her
My Arabic isn't very good
You've reached the bottom
I'd like to drink a cup of tea
I'm arriving now
I'm getting in now
And you're a teacher, right?
Brainwashing works!
I think I've been brainwashed
Are you busy on Monday?
Does your throat hurt?
How did you manage that?
Don't feed the trolls
Can they die?
It's horrible
I don't know why I'm scared
You're not going to like it
What's Tom doing right now?
You've gained a few pounds
We're very proud of you
Hey, handsome
He's lazy and vain
I always get what I'm after
We're going to the mall
You've aroused my interest
Where do you want to eat?
I don't know
You choose.
You're such a weirdo
What are you so nervous about?
His muscles were rock-hard
What're you so nervous about?
I couldn't speak
What?
What did you say?
You're the woman of my dreams
I couldn't keep from smiling
Does Tom understand French?
They're staring at each other
I'm listening here in Brazil
Tom's useless
You've played
You'd played
You've been playing
You'd been playing
Can you help me?
He's moved away
Today I'm paying!
Today I'm crying!
He didn't even read it
Give me a kuritsa please!
What?
Kuritza!
I want a kuritsa!
Give me this kuritsa.
No, this is a chicken.
I don't want a chicken
I want a kuritsa!
This one won't
I'd like to know that
I'd like to know that too
I wish I knew that!
That's it!
Do you even lift?
I'd like to know that.
I'd like to know that too...
I wish I knew that!
I wish I knew that, too.
He isn't home
So, you'd better just shut up
We'll be thirsty
Where's my phone?
It's on my table
She'll like this game
Did he forget the money?
Did Tom forget to pay?
I'd like to go back to Boston
Finally, though late, he came
I don't like snow
You weren't ill
Do you want to try?
Why not?
Tom's socks don't match
Let's go somewhere far away
What're you planning now?
What were you planning to do?
It's time to go back home
He's pig-headed
My advantange over them.
Where did I put the car keys?
Where did I put the keys?
He's so much of a faggot
The photo didn't come out well
I've spent all my money
You're much spoken about
Trust me, I'm an engineer!
I've been waiting for years
Rushia, do you have a sister?
In whole, desirably
Six to five for the viewers!
Hmm..
Hey, what are you doing?
Hit the brakes, darling
I've never seen such a tattoo
What's happened?
Isn't that a miracle?
Have you talked to Tom?
Everybody's name is Tom here!
Which one do you need?
The one that is Mary's friend!
There's nothing to force here!
You're who I need now
It's curtains for me!
I don't care at all
Don't thou me
Don't fellow me
They're not kidding
I hope I didn't wake you up
You're as pale as a ghost
Have you been naughty or nice?
She's timid
Whose things are those?
Everything's really cheap
Everything's very cheap
Why don't you take a hike?
Your Majesty, you are evil!
Where am I?
How long was I out?
Two hours.
You're here to pay your taxes?
Not quite.
Gwonam!
My cake didn't rise
I'm totally drunk
You hypocrite!
I don't need favors
We've never been to that place
That's a severe disease
It's time I got revenge
Now I will kill you!
School is over at 3:30
I haven't read it
Don't worry
I'll be careful
This is crud!
They're laughing at me!
You don't say?
Take him away.
Yes, my liege!
Link, I need you.
Finally!
I'll take off my clothes!
Not in that sense, silly
Today is Father's birthday!
The King has a birthday?!
Does she own a pet?
Does he own a pet?
Does she have a pet?
Does he have a pet?
This looks awesome!
How soon can you land?
I can't tell.
I'm a doctor.
No, I mean I'm just not sure!
Can't you take a guess?
I don't dream
I wasn't dreaming
Who loves the son?
Whom does the father love?
Which father loves his son?
Whom do you expect?
I'm looking for a stick
Have you a carriage here?
It is already six o'clock!
Hm!
You're right!
How much does this book cost?
We don't have a daughter
I'm a congruent man
Don't turn the light off
I bet you're in love
I'm trying to calm her down
Do you believe horoscopes?
I promise I'll never leave you
Don't rely on him much
Hi, I'm looking for friends
I can't complete with you
Give me some water, be so kind
Tom is seven, Mary is eleven
You'll go with me
Full stop!
Get out of my kitchen!
Yes, that's fine too.
Why didn't you replied to me?
I owe you all nothing!
You don't have enough friends
We're not as young as Tom
Is Mr. Richard at home?
Tom scored a goal!
Where did they teach you that?
I don't have books
I haven't got books
I'm proud of my dad
Don't forget your coat!
Have you ever seen a monkey?
Don't you want a cup of tea?
Don't they want a cup of tea?
Have you read the Holy Bible?
They won't find her
They won't find it
It's a mineral
They're not rocks
They're minerals
Has Tom got a cat?
You're pale as a ghost
Who sent you here?
What an amazing goal!
It's an easy plant to grow
There's a bomb on board!
I'll have my revenge
Make him stop!
Make him confess!
She's in her room
When will we meet?
Would you give me your number?
So she isn't new
That's how it's supposed to be
I'm making waffles
I'll be there after breakfast
Did he sleep well?
Are you now married?
Do you prefer tea or coffee?
Congratulations!
You're a clown
Be a good listener!
We can't come home in time
There's no reason
When I came, he was out
Don't tell it to my bride
What did you gift him?
I'm quite innocent
Do Tom and Mary get along?
Well, I'd say it depends
Are you shitting me ?
What is it?
What am I?
Where is the Mexican embassy?
Where is the Romanian embassy?
Where is the Estonian embassy?
Where is the Irish embassy?
Where is the Syrian embassy?
Things aren't moving
We can't stand apart
You're serious, aren't you?
Who is this mysterious man?
Who is this mysterious woman?
Let's change the topic
What a clever dog!
Is everything alright?
Not really.
Have you read Tom's new book?
At your service, madam!
He's within his rights
She's within her rights
You're within your rights
She tends to be over-dramatic
I can't go shopping today
To hatred, I reply with pardon
I'd like to wring her neck
She's in the boudoir
How could she have known?
How could he have known?
I'm surrounded by enemies
He's not German, but Austrian
How safe is Brazil?
He's a fop
What was the time of death?
Did he have any enemies?
Did she have any enemies?
The maid didn't see anything
I can't help it
I don't even like him
I don't even like her
I can't talk to you here
It's too dangerous
Tom doesn't like women
Tom doesn't like those women
Tom doesn't like any women
Tom doesn't like that woman
Today's not Christmas!
I don't like roosters
What did you smoke?
Of course I want to catch up!
That kid has a crazy future!
They'll be like "ahaa!
Can you follow me?
And where is that?
Don't be so glum
I'll be free tonight
She's so huge!
I'm afraid of death very much
It's not Christmas today
That's my favorite book!
Honestly!
He's a boy, and she's a girl
Today isn't my birthday
I'm asking Tom to wait
I've read the book in one go
I'm at your service, sir
With a triple-headed snake
It's been raining hard
It's moving fast
There's nothing remaining
Why's he outside?
Invite him to come in!
He'll recover soon
Do you get it?
He's a talented administrator
I can't see any bruises
I'd like to be left alone
Are you trying your best?
You aren't kids anymore
I'm sure Tom will do his best
You're no longer children
And that's your best?
What's your goal for 2014?
My yogurt expires in 2014!
I can't believe he's dead!
I can't believe she's dead!
He's not an evil man
Omigod, Tom, this is so nice!
He's a private detective
He's a gumshoe
He's a shamus
He's a private dick
Don't be impatient!
What are you two doing here?
She's traveling alone
Premarital sex?
Yes, Tom
It means sex before marriage.
These are the girls!
Nobody's going to believe this
Do you recognize these men?
Do you recognize this T-shirt?
He's fighting for his life
She's fighting for her life
Is this the best we can do?
I don't want 2013 to end
How did it go?
Not well.
What do you love about Tom?
What do you like about Tom?
Are you attracted to her?
Are you attracted to him?
I'd rather walk than pedal
Are you attracted to me?
Don't read my diary!
Don't read my journal!
I'm calm
You've heard it here first!
He fell while skiing off-piste
He's used to traveling
That's hogwash
What is this abomination?
Why is he your friend?
Why is she your friend?
Why do you like Tom?
Listen, foreigner
Tom probably doesn't like you
I don't hate you anymore
Do you recognize those men?
Okay, I lied
It was just a one-nighter
I don't know how he does it
I don't know how she does it
Can you make an exception?
Las Vegas was great!
And what if he rejects me?
And what if she rejects me?
Are your parents home?
Don't ask for the impossible
You're right, Mary
What wine goes well with Brie?
I'm traveling by myself
Wasn't he your friend?
I didn't use to smoke
It's okay to be a gay
Let's get back on topic
You're acting very strangely
Get your ass in here!
I'm not defending him!
He's tall and thin
Can you fix my computer?
I'm not related to Tom
Do you want to go to my room?
Why does no one believe me?
I'm saving myself for marriage
When does 2013 end?
He's Tom's chauffeur
Alas, I was inattentive
She's great in bed
What the hell?!
Hark, what have you done?
Nothing yet. ...No, I have.
Hell no, boy!
Take him away!
Tom is Mary's chauffeur
Are you in London?
My salary is 300,000 yen
It wasn't a big store, right?
Guess what?
What does that mean?
When will dinner be ready?
I'm terribly hungry
I couldn't accept the job
She didn't resist for long
I'm afraid he'll kill me
Stand in the corner!
She's a fangirl
Are those guys your brothers?
Are those guys your friends?
Are we going to be late?
Are you aware of any problems?
Are you aware of the risks?
Are you here to help us?
Are you here to spy on me?
Are you hiding something?
Are you in any pain?
Are you in Boston?
Are you in much pain?
Are you kids having fun?
Are you kids hungry?
Are you ready to do this?
Are you really not mad at me?
Are you registered to vote?
Are you responsible for this?
Are you sure you can do that?
Are you telling me to stop?
Aren't you hot?
As usual, Tom was late
At that time, Tom was swimming
Can I do anything to help?
Can this wait until tomorrow?
Can Tom swim?
Can we just eat, please?
Can we just get on with this?
Can we meet somewhere?
Can we postpone the trip?
Can you just go home?
Can you lower your voice?
Can you protect me?
Can you prove that?
Can you speak French like Tom?
Can you swim like Tom?
Can't we all just get along?
Can't we just leave?
Could we get out of here?
Could you just hurry?
Could you lower your voice?
Couldn't you just do it later?
Did that hurt?
Did that just happen?
Did that really happen?
Did that really just happen?
Did Tom say anything else?
Did Tom swim yesterday?
Did you come here yesterday?
Did you just make that up?
Did you just say my name?
Did you make this?
Did you receive my message?
Do you have identification?
Do we have to do this now?
Do you believe Tom?
Do you consider Tom a friend?
Do you feel better?
Do you feel like a drink?
Do you folks need anything?
Do you have a choice?
Do you have any comment?
Do you have any ideas?
Do you have hair clippers?
Do you have life insurance?
Do you know how this works?
Do you know how to do that?
Do you know that song?
Do you know these guys?
Do you know what these are?
Do you know what Tom needs?
Do you know what you just did?
Do you know who it is?
Do you like pirate movies?
Do you mind if I leave early?
Do you mind if I park here?
Do you really believe that?
Do you really like this dress?
Do you recognize these?
Do you recognize this key?
Do you recognize this?
Do you still live in Boston?
Do you still play golf?
Do you think Tom can swim?
Do you trust me, Tom?
Do you want another beer?
Do you want that?
If so, I'll buy it for you
Do you want to go back?
Do you want to go to a movie?
Do you want to go to dinner?
Do you want to go to lunch?
Do you want to rest for a bit?
Does Tom have a choice?
Isn't that dangerous?
Does Tom swim every day?
Does Tom swim often?
Don't stay too late
Don't stay too long
Don't swim here
Don't trust anyone over twenty
Everybody, get out of my house
Get into the boat, please
Has Tom already eaten?
Has Tom already left?
Has Tom finished his homework?
Have you been studying?
Hey, who are you?
How are the repairs going?
How can you be so naive?
How could you do such a thing?
How did everyone react?
How did you get into trouble?
How do we get Tom out of jail?
How do you want your eggs?
How is the construction going?
How's the job?
I assume that Tom can't swim
I can't talk right now
I'm eating dinner
I didn't feel like going
I didn't know that Tom swam
I didn't know you liked Mary
I don't enjoy teaching French
I don't get it at all
I don't like speaking French
I don't want you to be here
I expect that Tom won't swim
I expect Tom won't swim
I guess it can't be helped
I've never cheated on a test
I haven't done that yet
I intend to be there by 2:30
I must've overlooked something
I must've been drugged
I still don't think it's funny
I still think it's funny
I think it's safe to swim here
I think Tom doesn't eat meat
I told Tom that I wasn't busy
I told Tom that I wasn't ready
I told Tom that I wasn't tired
Do you want to go with me?
I wonder why Tom isn't here
I'll ask around for you
I'll do a quick check
I'll do something else
I'll do what has to be done
I'll explain it later
I'll go straight home
I'll go to the police with you
I'll have Tom help you
I'll have Tom mow your lawn
I'll swim with Tom tomorrow
I'll teach you French
I'll teach you how to swim
I'll tell Tom you dropped by
I'm all worn out
I'm glad to see you guys again
I'm happy nothing bad happened
I'm just not having any fun
I'm just not hungry
I'm not a doctor yet
I'm not certain Tom likes that
I'm not going to give up
I'm not going to go with you
I'm not going to quit now
I'm not hungry yet
I'm not letting Tom drive
I'm not ready to do that
I'm not ready to go home
I'm not ready to retire yet
I'm not saying you can't go
I'm not saying you can't swim
I'm not sure what to do next
I'm not sure what to do now
I'm not sure where my hotel is
I'm not sure where Tom lives
I'm not tired yet
I'm so sick of this song
I'm sorry for calling so late
I'm starting to feel hungry
I'm starting to feel tired
I'm sure I can help
I'm teaching myself to juggle
I'm tired of watching TV
Let's do something else
I've had a tough afternoon
I've had a tough day
I've had a tough week
I've had a tough year
I've heard Mary is really cute
I've never eaten rabbit meat
If I have time, I'll drop by
If Tom goes, I will, too
If Tom goes, I'll go, too
If Tom swims, I will, too
Is lunch ready?
Is there something out there?
Is Tom a licensed therapist?
Is Tom able to drive a truck?
Is Tom able to drive?
Is Tom able to speak French?
Is Tom able to swim?
Is Tom cleaning his room now?
Is Tom going to eat with us?
Is Tom going to swim tomorrow?
Is Tom in Boston now?
Is Tom learning French?
Is Tom sleeping?
Is Tom still eating?
Is Tom still happy?
Is Tom still hungry?
Is Tom still in Boston?
Is Tom still studying French?
Is Tom still swimming?
Is Tom still taking a shower?
Is Tom swimming?
Isn't that what I just said?
Isn't that what you just said?
It isn't just about money
It just isn't fair
It just isn't the same
It just wasn't appropriate
It just wasn't enough
It just wasn't what we thought
It just wouldn't be right
It looks like we're all here
It was definitely Tom's fault
It wasn't just luck
It wasn't just me
It wasn't just that
It'll just be a minute
It'll just be a moment
It'll just be a second
It'll just be you and me
It'll just take a minute
It'll just take a moment
It'll just take some time
It's all gotten out of control
It's getting hot
It's getting out of control
It's just a baby
It's just a beer
It's just a cat
It's just a cut
It's just a fad
It's just a feeling
It's just a guess
It's just a headache
It's just a hobby
It's just a job, you know?
It's just a precaution
It's just a scratch, OK?
It's just a suggestion
It's just an idea
It's just been awful
It's just going to take time
It's just my luggage
It's just not enough
It's just not going to happen
It's just not possible
It's just not right
It's just not safe
It's just not that easy
It's just not what we do
It's just so creepy
It's just so early
It's just so exciting
It's just so frustrating
It's just so hard
It's just so pretty
It's just so sad
It's just so unexpected
It's just that simple
It's just up ahead
It's just what happens
It's just you and me
It's not just a guess
It's not just a pen
It's not worth the risk
It's time for us to get going
It's time for you to wake up
Just who are you anyway?
I'll take care of everything
Let's all go together
Let's get Tom out of the water
Let's go somewhere nice
Let's go the other way
Let's go to the mall tonight
Let's go to Tom's place
Let's just get on with it, OK?
Let's just get Tom out of here
Let's schedule a meeting
Let's sing together
Let's sing
Look into that, would you?
Mary and Alice aren't sisters
Maybe it just isn't funny
The water's not too clean
Please don't feed the pigeons
Please don't tell anybody else
Please tell Tom I'm sorry
Should I have not done that?
Some people don't eat meat
Some people don't like dogs
Something's definitely wrong
Stay out of Tom's room
Step out of the car, please
Swimming isn't allowed here
Tell me where you're going
That's a possible explanation
That's exactly what I did
That's exactly what I would do
That's just a rumor
That's just as bad
That's just not acceptable
That's just not right
That's just so sad
That's just the point
That's just what we wanted
That's utter nonsense
That's what I think, too
I am so blessed!
We can't afford this
We can't trust them now
We don't know who he is
We don't sell what you want
We hope you'll cooperate
We must do as they say, Tom
We must do something, Tom
We must respect Tom's decision
We must trust each other, Tom
We need Tom's strength now
We shouldn't be here
We'd better do as Tom says
We'd better do something
We'd better humor Tom
We'd better warn the others
We'd both really appreciate it
We'll all go together
We'll be ready for them
We'll do all we can
We'll do as you say
We'll do better tomorrow
We'll do it ourselves
We'll do more tests tomorrow
We'll do the best we can
We'll do the rest
We'll do this later
We'll do this together
We'll do what we can
We'll go in a minute
We'll go this afternoon
We'll go with you
We'll have plenty of time
We'll have plenty to do
We'll have to do this quickly
We'll have to risk it
We'll just go now
We'll just have to wait
We'll pray for you
We're a week ahead of schedule
We're about to go swimming
We're all a bit a scared
We're all adults here
We're all prisoners here
We're all pros here
We're all proud of you
We're all quite fond of Tom
We're all so proud of you
We're all very proud of Tom
We're aware of that
We're aware of the problem
We're aware of the risks
We're aware of the situation
We're behind schedule now
We're both reasonable people
We're grateful for your help
We're guests here
We're here to assist you
We're here to help you
We're here to support you, Tom
We're in a bit of a hurry now
We're just finishing up
We're lucky to be alive
We're not allowed to do that
We're not allowed to go there
We're not as dumb as you think
We're not entirely sure
We're not ready to do that
We're not ready to go yet
We're not terrorists
We're preparing to do so
We're proceeding on schedule
We're proud of you
We're quite fond of Tom
We're so glad you could come
We're so proud of you
We're surrounded by police
We're very disappointed in you
We're wasting our time
We're wasting precious time
We've allowed for that
We've already hired a lawyer
We've dodged another bullet
We've got to get out of here
We've had some bitter winters
We've isolated the problem
What did you just say?

Everything's just like before
You've lied to us before
Please don't say anything more
I should've eaten more
I don't need your help anymore
There's no known cure
Tom wasn't sure
That's pure conjecture
Tom looked at Mary's picture
Here's to the future
I'm worried about my future
Leave a message, please
Tom isn't making much sense
That's complete nonsense
I'd probably lose
I've got nothing you could use
I don't even have a house
Tom wouldn't leave the house
We went to Tom's house
There's the lighthouse
Tom called to say he'd be late
Tom said that he'd be late
I want to know why you're late
I think you've been fortunate
I should've been more polite
Tom isn't very polite
I've got some reports to write
I've only got a minute
Tom didn't try to argue
It just couldn't be true
It's quite true
I wonder if that's true
I wonder if it's true
What Tom said wasn't true
That wasn't true
I bet that's not true
I haven't said you could leave
I've made up my mind to leave
It's now time to leave
We'd better leave
I think we'd better leave
Well, that's all I have
I think you've been very brave
I'm glad I'm alive
Good advice isn't expensive
This isn't exactly impressive
I'm feeling a bit stiff
Don't repeat yourself
I don't believe it myself
I've seen it myself
Everything's taken care of
There's a hole in the bag
Tom doesn't often beg
Don't be so demanding
I'd say Tom was only bluffing
You're not very encouraging
I couldn't help laughing
Tom's computer keeps crashing
It's the real thing
I've missed something
You've omitted something
I've forgotten something
Tom might've caught something
I've taken nothing
We don't need anything
I should've not said anything
Tom wasn't sure of anything
Tom didn't want to do anything
I couldn't eat anything
Tom couldn't say anything
I'll arrange everything
You can't do everything
I'll pay for everything
I've been thinking
Let's go bowling
I don't like swimming
I don't want to go swimming
There's a guard coming
Tell Tom I'm coming
It's very alarming
It's maddening
Somebody's listening
I'll remember this evening
It's very entertaining
It was Tom's doing
Your sister's sleeping
You're shivering
Tom didn't sing
It's really confusing
It's fascinating
They're interesting
It wasn't interesting
Isn't it interesting?
There's no use arguing
I know why you're leaving
You're not trying
It won't be long
It won't take me long
Tom didn't stay there long
I've stayed away too long
It shouldn't take us long
The rain didn't last long
That shouldn't take very long
It won't take very long
You've been right all along
Let's try to get along
I think maybe you're wrong
I don't think you're wrong
Maybe I'm wrong
It didn't seem wrong
Tom wasn't young
My parents weren't very rich
They don't understand French
I'm still studying French
I know you can't speak French
Tom couldn't speak French
We should've brought lunch
They didn't argue much
You shouldn't do too much
Tom didn't eat much
That's a bit much
It wouldn't cost much
Tom couldn't see very much
I've missed you very much
I'll keep in touch
Tom didn't laugh
I think you've said enough
I think we've heard enough
We've been waiting long enough
I think we've eaten enough
Being rich isn't enough
It isn't enough
This is Tom's photograph
I'll do as you wish
You're afraid of the truth
Tom wasn't telling the truth
I can't hear myself speak
They didn't speak
The signal's very weak
I think I'll walk back
One moment, please
I'll be right back
I'll send it back
I can't go to school today
I'm sick
It's time to talk
Tom couldn't talk
Tom doesn't like milk
Let's go have a drink
Tom might've been drunk
It's an interesting book
I think you'll enjoy this book
I'm scared of the dark
I'll find work
They're refusing to work
This didn't work
This might be Tom's desk
It's a calculated risk
There's absolutely no risk
That's typical
It's all perfectly legal
Everything's quite informal
Everything's back to normal
It's unnatural
Tom didn't regret his refusal
I should've changed the oil
I'm not scared at all
You don't understand at all
I couldn't eat anything at all
It wasn't interesting at all
It didn't work at all
That won't do at all
Tom didn't sleep at all
They're not busy at all
I've been watching baseball
You're very tall
We've done well
I'm quite well
The project isn't going well
I haven't been well
Business isn't going so well
Tom didn't sleep well
They didn't pay us very well
Tom can't paint very well
I was impressed by Tom's skill
I've never skipped school
I've been very careful
We've been very careful
Don't be ungrateful
I'm not ungrateful
It's simply beautiful
I think you've been wonderful
It's wonderful
It's just awful
The curfew begins at 7:00 p.m
Let's get them
Tom knew Mary didn't like him
Come here, Tom
Don't go, Tom
We'll take care of you, Tom
Don't cry, Tom
Don't disturb Tom
I didn't say I persuaded Tom
I didn't say I liked Tom
I think I should've helped Tom
I've always admired Tom
I wish I hadn't kissed Tom
I thought I'd never find Tom
Let's go and see Tom
I knew you wouldn't like Tom
That's why I don't like Tom
I heard you don't like Tom
I can't forgive Tom
There's someone with Tom
I won't even tell Tom
I promise I'll never tell Tom
Some people think I'm Tom
Don't be hard on Tom
I'll be good to Tom
I'll write to Tom
I've written to Tom
It didn't matter to Tom
I think we'll have to help Tom
I couldn't help Tom
I'm surprised you remember Tom
You're too good for Tom
I didn't wait for Tom
There's Tom
I'm not angry at Tom
I'll show that to Tom
I've already met Tom
I wish I hadn't hit Tom
I'm not the one who hurt Tom
Someone's going to hurt Tom
I don't think we can trust Tom
I don't worry about Tom
I'm glad we saw Tom
It's only Tom
We don't have enough room
Tom wasn't in his room
I wonder who it's from
It's only another false alarm
It's unusually warm
I'll do it if I can
Tom knows I'm Canadian
Tom isn't a vegetarian
Let's stick with the plan
That's my plan
I'm glad I'm a man
I think you'll need a loan
I don't think we were seen
I wasn't alone then
You're quite mistaken
We've already eaten
Tom didn't write so often
That's always a good sign
This isn't a good sign
I won't give in
Let's go on in
Tom wasn't in
I think it's happening again
It's good to see you all again
I'll never mention Tom again
I'll write to Tom again
I'll never leave Boston again
I won't do that again
We'll meet again
I'll do it again
That'll be hard to explain
It's tough to explain
It's too difficult to explain
It's difficult to explain
I've decided to go by train
Tom is Mary's second cousin
Tom knows that he can't win
There's a war going on
That's a matter of opinion
Tom never would've asked
It's a foregone conclusion
It's an impossible situation
We've only got one option
Don't ask that question
You've answered my question
We'll take every precaution
Tom'll be here soon
It'll start raining soon
Tom'll be all right soon
I'll be thirty soon
That's the true reason
That's the real reason
Don't blame the wrong person
Tom wouldn't like Boston
Tom doesn't like Boston
I'll never leave Boston
It's located in Boston
I'd rather live in Boston
I'm still living in Boston
I know you've been in Boston
Tom isn't in Boston
It's almost midnight in Boston
Tom hasn't ever been to Boston
I've decided to go to Boston
That's why I left Boston
There's no reason for concern
Don't be so stubborn
This won't burn
Now it's our turn
That would've been fun
It's great fun
It wouldn't be any fun
We'll never back down
Tom wouldn't sit down
Tom didn't drown
I'm going to town
I'm headed downtown
I'm heading downtown
I wasn't sure what I should do
I'll see what else I can do
I know what I'm supposed to do
There's so much to do
Tom didn't tell me what to do
Don't you tell me what to do
I wasn't sure what to do
There's so much left to do
That's all we ever do
I said I'd go
I haven't said you could go
I've promised to go
You're now free to go
Please don't force me to go
Tom didn't want to go
I'm sorry, but I've got to go
I'm packed and ready to go
Everything's ready to go
Tom won't let us go
Tom didn't go
Tom didn't regret saying no
Let me come, too
You'd better come, too
My name's Tom, too
I would like to go, too
I thought so, too
I like dogs, too
I like that, too
Tom liked it, too
I've done so
Tom didn't exactly say so
I think you've been lied to
Tom told me what you're up to
I'm afraid it's rather cheap
The snow's a foot deep
Tom didn't sleep
They're not all asleep
Tom wasn't asleep
If you ask Tom, he'll help
Well, maybe I can help
Tom would've liked to help
I thought I'd be able to help
They're trying to help
They're just trying to help
I thought I'd ask Tom for help
We'll need to ask Tom for help
We'll be needing your help
Tom couldn't help
I'm not going to need any help
I didn't give up
We'd better wash up
Tom didn't even look up
Everyone's pretty shaken up
Tom wasn't one of the group
We'll see you at the bar
I think I've made myself clear
Tom's voice was clear
Now you've gone too far
Tom couldn't jump that far
It's peculiar
Tom wasn't popular
Don't touch my guitar
That's what I can't remember
Tom couldn't remember
I'm an officer
I'm a really bad dancer
I should've studied harder
Don't make me suffer
That's the new manager
We think you're in danger
We're really in danger
Pretend I'm a stranger
Tom didn't recognize her
I've just become a grandfather
I'm a grandfather
Tom didn't want to go either
I should've started earlier
We should've started earlier
You should've started earlier
I should've gone home earlier
I should've quit earlier
We should've quit earlier
You should've quit earlier
I'm the gardener
Here's a piece of paper
Let's all have supper
I thought I'd do that later
That's Tom's daughter
There's nothing the matter
That's what's the matter
It's a confidential matter
It's a serious matter
You've made everything better
It's getting better
That's all over
The concert's over
The play's over
The evening isn't over
I've been thinking it over
The show's almost over
I'm in the shower
There's only one answer
Tom didn't want to answer
Tom isn't a good card player
I'm your new lawyer
That's my chair
That's what I wished for
That's what I asked for
Here's the file you asked for
You've got a lot to live for
I know who you're waiting for
It's not worth waiting for
I like Tom's subtle humor
There's no front door
Tom wasn't poor
Tom isn't a stamp collector
Tom's father was a doctor
Let's wait an hour
I'll give you an hour
I thought it was Tom's
Tom couldn't see what it was
That's the way it was
You're in my hands
We're already good friends
I'll explain afterwards
They've seen our faces
I'd cut down those trees
I don't like cranberries
We'll have some difficulties
I've made so many mistakes
There aren't any rules
They're the right ones
Let's stop fooling ourselves
I didn't open any of the boxes
Tom couldn't hide his feelings
Tom's mother didn't like dogs
Tom isn't as naive as Mary is
I didn't say I wanted this
Tom didn't like this
Wait, we can't do this
I don't need to know this
I thought you'd enjoy this
I've had my share of problems
They're Canadians
Don't feed the pigeons
Tom didn't move his lips
Everybody's upstairs
Let's go indoors
It's perfectly useless
I can't stand rudeness
You don't understand business
I can't find Tom's address
It's wild guess
That's our new boss
I didn't like my boss
I don't have any pets
This area's off limits
I'm not sure what Tom wants
I'll pay whatever it costs
They didn't see us
Tom doesn't blame us
Tom never said he'd go with us
Tom won't want to go with us
You can't go with us
Tom wasn't with us
Tom won't fail us
I knew you wouldn't help us
I'm sure Tom won't help us
There's nothing to stop us
There's a place for us
They're going to do it for us
Everyone's looking at us
I hope it's nothing serious
Now it's serious
I'm rather curious
It's rather curious
That's curious
I'm really curious
I think that's ridiculous
Don't be presumptuous
You're making Tom nervous
That's bad news
Here's some good news
Well, I have some news
Let's see what Tom says
They weren't all boys
I think I'll go out to eat
I heard you don't eat meat
Tom still doesn't eat meat
That would've been great
We're getting fat
I think I'm fat
Tom wasn't fat
Tom wouldn't have liked that
We've already settled that
I didn't say I did that
I'm not the one who did that
Don't give up like that
It's always like that
Tom didn't like that
Tom wasn't like that
I wish I hadn't done that
Tom hasn't done that
I'm glad of that
I've thought of that
I've always hated doing that
Tom doesn't like doing that
I can't imagine doing that
I didn't plan on doing that
I've already told Tom that
I'm the one who gave Tom that
I've always known that
I couldn't help Tom do that
You aren't allowed to do that
They don't like to do that
Tom doesn't like to do that
Tom won't be able to do that
I didn't tell you to do that
We'll never do that
Tom won't let us do that
I thought Tom wouldn't do that
I just won't do that
Even Tom doesn't do that
I don't object to that
It's too soon for that
I don't think Tom knows that
Please don't make me eat that
I can't forget that
I'll not forget that
There's no mistake about that
There's no doubt about that
Tom wasn't right about that
Don't let Tom know that
It wasn't only that
I won't deny that
I knew you'd enjoy that
Here's a fun fact
That wasn't my object
I really wish you'd be quiet
I'll just keep quiet
I'm glad we met
Actually, we've already met
Tom knew Mary's secret
I've come up with a new set
I know why you're upset
Tom isn't married yet
I haven't shaved yet
Tom isn't awake yet
Hasn't Tom come home yet?
I haven't told anyone yet
We don't need to leave yet
I haven't seen anything yet
The kettle isn't boiling yet
The water isn't boiling yet
Tom hasn't studied French yet
They haven't come back yet
Tom hasn't come back yet
I haven't seen Tom yet
Tom isn't beaten yet
I'm not ready to go yet
The day isn't over yet
The honeymoon's not over yet
I'm not famous yet
I haven't opened it yet
Tom hasn't kissed Mary yet
They're open till eight
I think I'm not too overweight
We're ready to fight
Tom wasn't at home last night
It's almost midnight
Everyone can't be right
It's not quite right
I hope it'll be all right
Tom said you'll be all right
Well, that's all right
It didn't seem right
The creek's to our right
What's right is right
There's still no end in sight
Love can't be bought
It isn't what I thought
There's a nice thought
I couldn't stand it
I couldn't understand it
Tom couldn't understand it
Tom couldn't find it
I've never heard it
I'll chance it
Tom couldn't see it
We'll manage it
Tom just didn't like it
Tom wouldn't like it
I know you'll love it
I'll try to memorize it
I've heard of it
Tom wouldn't hear of it
We're still discussing it
Tom didn't feel it
I'm sure Tom can do it
They're going to do it
There's a way to do it
We're still checking into it
We can't help it
You couldn't help it
I couldn't bear it
I really don't remember it
They're looking for it
They're waiting for it
Well, that explains it
Let's discuss it
I'll never forget it
Don't forget it
Well, you'll regret it
Tom won't want it
Tom couldn't prevent it
I haven't got it
I've kept it
We're still talking about it
We don't want to talk about it
Don't talk about it
It's impossible to fix it
I couldn't deny it
It's not worth the wait
We didn't wait
Tom didn't wait
We can't do anything but wait
I should've added more salt
That's your own fault
It's our own fault
It's all your own fault
Perhaps it isn't your fault
This is no one's fault
That was perhaps Tom's fault
That wasn't Tom's fault
That was Tom's only fault
It wasn't all my fault
That wasn't my fault
That really wasn't my fault
They're too difficult
Tom says it's quite important
They're exactly what we want
That's exactly what we want
I'm also a student
You're very disobedient
It's very convenient
Let's be silent
It's excellent
It's dark in the basement
Don't forget to pay the rent
Well, that's different
Tom can't paint
Tom didn't hunt
Well, that's all I've got
The room's getting hot
I'm enjoying myself a lot
Well, that helps a lot
I've always admired you a lot
I've missed you a lot
Tom doesn't seem very smart
Here's the best part
You would've liked the concert
I knew you'd enjoy the concert
There's nothing new to report
I should've eaten breakfast
Tom didn't want any breakfast
I'm willing to forget the past
Tom's plan seemed the best
Tom's plan seems the best
I've done my best
This isn't a fair test
You're my guest
I'm studying to be an artist
Don't get lost
Tom'll find out
This isn't working out
I don't like eating out
You'd better look out
I've got to go out
Tom couldn't figure it out
There's another way out
That's all we talk about
You're all I can think about
I've always admired you
Forget what I've just told you
I don't quite understand you
Come on, Tom, I'll race you
It's so nice to see you
I just hope I didn't bore you
I didn't mean to deceive you
I've got nothing to give you
I'm still afraid of you
Well, I'm proud of you
That wasn't very nice of you
I've had enough of you
I'm jealous of you
They're just using you
I'll teach you
I'll soon be with you
I think we'll go with you
I didn't expect this from you
I'm richer than you
I've never forgotten you
I'm not interested in you
I didn't tell on you
I've asked Tom to help you
Well, I can't help you
That's why I can't help you
I've got nothing to offer you
I'll look after you
I'll get over you
Well, I waited for you
I'll send for you
Well, I'm here for you
I'll do anything for you
Everyone's looking for you
Everybody's looking for you
Everyone's asking for you
Everybody's waiting for you
There's a call for you
Tom wasn't mad at you
It's very nice to meet you
I've got nothing against you
I couldn't live without you
I can't repay you
I can't marry you
I don't know what Tom saw
We'll do it somehow
Please don't leave me now
Tom and Mary aren't here now
I'm going back there now
You're my girl now
I'm a man now
There's no danger now
You'll feel better now
That's over now
I'm done for now
I'm your boss now
Well, it's obvious now
I'm on the phone right now
We're all right now
Tom's all right now
We're eating dinner right now
We're having dinner right now
I'm very busy right now
I can't tell you now
You'd better take it easy now
Well, just let me know
That's what I wanted to know
It's too early to know
They didn't know
I'm going tomorrow
It'll be ready tomorrow
Tomorrow is Father's Day
Is something the matter?
It's a hot day
Let's go there today
I don't want to be late today
It's unusually warm today
There's a lot work to do today
It's much warmer today
Tom didn't enjoy the play
Tom didn't pray
There's so much to say
That's easy to say
I've had my say
I think I can't stay
They won't stay
You've got to do it this way
They've all moved away
They're not going away
I didn't run away
I'd better go away
Tom won't go away
I can't get away
I thought you'd be ready
I'm not quite ready
I'm still getting ready
We're all ready
I'm always ready
I'm going to go get ready
It's time for us to get ready
It's time we got ready
They're not ready
Tom must've gone home already
You've said that already
I'm not engaged to anybody
I thought I'd give you a key
Tom's got the key
I think we'll need more money
I can't borrow any more money
I can't understand why
I guess I'm lucky
I think you've been lucky
Tom wasn't so lucky
I'm enjoying myself immensely
You've got a wonderful family
It's from your family
I'm waiting for your reply
I haven't eaten pizza recently
I think you've been a bad boy
I'm not your errand boy
Tom's a nice boy
Tom wasn't sleepy
I'm beginning to get sleepy
I'm feeling a bit sleepy
Tom wasn't a bit sleepy
They said they're happy
Apparently, everyone was happy
I know why you're not happy
Tom won't make you happy
Tom wasn't really happy
You've made my friend unhappy
I know why you're unhappy
You've made Tom unhappy
I know you've been unhappy
Tom must've misunderstood Mary
Even Tom doesn't like Mary
Tom didn't blame Mary
Tom didn't argue with Mary
Tom didn't wait for Mary
Tom didn't look at Mary
Tom didn't think about Mary
I've never kept a diary
It's almost our anniversary
You know this isn't necessary
Tom didn't want to cry
Tom didn't want Mary to cry
I thought you'd be angry
I can tell that you're angry
I know why you're angry
They said they're hungry
I'm beginning to get hungry
I'm feeling a bit hungry
Tom wasn't a bit hungry
Tom wasn't really hungry
Tom doesn't seem very hungry
It's a fantastic story
That's a really nice story
That's an interesting story
Well, you'd better hurry
I'd say that's worth a try
Well, it's worth a try
We'll let Tom try
Sometimes it's easy
This work isn't easy
You don't make it easy
I thought you wouldn't be busy
Tom won't be busy
They said they're busy
They're not all busy
I know you've been busy
I'm not usually this busy
Tom wasn't really busy
Tom doesn't seem very busy
Let's drive into the city
It's a wonderful opportunity
There's only one difficulty
My rifle's empty
Tom's glass was empty
The box wasn't empty
The box isn't empty
It's a great party
I don't want you at my party
I thought you'd be thirsty
They said they're thirsty
I wasn't thirsty
It's Tom's duty
They've all gone crazy
I'm still dizzy
Will you be finished by 2:30?
Can you reach high C?
I've offended you, haven't I?
Wait here a second, OK?
Don't do that again, OK?
How did you get that idea?
Should I make some tea?
So what's your dilemma?
Does Tom really like opera?
What was your last job?
Do you want something to read?
What should we do instead?
Do you have something to add?
How early do you go to bed?
Why did you get divorced?
Are you wounded?
What do you think you need?
Do you have what you need?
Are you almost finished?
Is Tom still married?
How long has Tom been married?
Was Tom ever married?
Why is the door locked?
Why wasn't I asked?
Why is Tom's name circled?
Well, what's it called?
Is everybody's mug filled?
Who said I was ashamed?
Do you know what's happened?
Why were they scared?
Did you say Tom was murdered?
Why is Tom tired?
Why are you tired?
Why aren't you tired?
Were you really surprised?
Why are you embarrassed?
Are you dressed?
Have you been mistreated?
Are you two related?
Are you related?
What do you think Tom wanted?
What was it Tom wanted?
Have you been arrested?
Was Tom annoyed?
When do I get paid?
How can I stop being afraid?
Was that all Tom said?
What do you think I did?
What is it you think I did?
What do you think Tom did?
What did Tom think you did?
How can anyone be so stupid?
How's Tom's cold?
Why was I never told?
Will you lend a hand?
Who's your best friend?
Did Tom mind?
Can I get a refund?
Is that clearly understood?
Does Tom have a beard?
Can we be overheard?
Where else would Tom be?
What fun would that be?
Who can that be?
Where else could it be?
Who could it be?

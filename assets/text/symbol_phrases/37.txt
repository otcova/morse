If only I could watch telly!
Mary'll be there.
Mary?
He's with someone else now
Her name's Anna
I'm getting to know him
Shall we have some tea?
He's back from vacation
There's a cop under the bridge
It's a tax dodge
Don't call me on my home phone
Some fears aren't justified
They're irrational
I wasn't willing to give up
She can't get off with one man
What...for realsies?
Do your bowels act regularly?
Give me my crutches!
Show me your tongue!
Let me see your tongue!
Don't speak so quickly!
Is he trying to hit on me?
She's a real bitch
What's that, Cookie?
Tom fell down the well?
Want to split a pizza?
I knocked over a tin of paint.
You plonker!
It didn't mean anything.
“Ding-dong!
Ding-dong!
Ding-dong!
We're afraid of dogs
Mary doesn't speak English
Don't you wanna go?
Where is the TV remote?
Matthew squeezed Linda's thigh
It didn't really matter though
It's snowing lightly
I don't think you realize it
Where did you learn Malayalam?
He's learning Malayalam
Do you know what a cicada is?
Do you know what a nebula is?
Do you know what cicadas are?
I've finished writing the song
My parrot is so cute!
I can tell.
How can you tell?
I don't want to have to choose
It's that time
We'll need to run some tests
Am I going to need surgery?
Could you roll up your sleeve?
Your temperature's a bit high
Your temperature's normal
The doctor bandaged Tom's leg
I've been having headaches
I'm going to give you a shot
I think I've pulled a muscle
I've been feeling depressed
And what do you get from that?
Almost nothing!
Matthew's face dropped
Matthew's voice lowered
Matthew didn't know any better
Matthew's anxiety was awful
Matthew couldn't rest
Matthew can't remember exactly
I didn't to that!
Honest to God!
Matthew didn't move a muscle
It didn't feel like a dream
Matthew hasn't been sleeping
The train wasn't too crowded
We're gonna fuck tonight
Matthew couldn't exactly leave
Matthew can't hurt Linda
Matthew didn't smile back
Matthew's dog lost her leg
Matthew found Linda's door
How was the dog acting?
Matthew didn't get visitors
Get the fuck off our property!
Matthew doesn't have a carpet
Matthew's dog was snarling
Tom's my favorite bartender
Is that a soap opera?
Please don't compare me to Tom
Tom's canceled
How do they get their funding?
You've got your girlfriend
Demon!
Yeah, you got me
I'm a demon
How'd you know?
I'll ring you tonight
I'll give you a ring tonight
You're not the only ones
They're not the only ones
And I'm like..
Fuck it dream!
Really?
I'll pretend I didn't see it
How do I get to the guildhall?
It's down this street.
How do I get to the cathedral?
It's down this road.
She's done nothing to you
I'll sit over there instead
I'll always be your boyfriend
It isn't really random
Has he slept?
Did he sleep?
Tom's hardly eaten anything
Sorry!
I'm already taken
Sorry, I'm already taken
How do you know that?
Tom dreamt it.
What?
Don't laugh!
I'll probably be late for tea
Certainly, sir
Tom, John's on the phone.
I'm not in!
Tom, John's on the phone.
I'm not here!
Can I use this trolley?
We've only just got here
We've only just arrived
How did you get your funding?
Where do you get your funding?
Have they finished?
What are your cousins called?
'Let me think a minute.'
'Take your time.'
I last saw him in 1945
I've just got back from a trip
I'm just back from a trip
Are you a Freemason?
Is that snake alive?
It's getting dark
Tom hasn't eaten much
Tom didn't want us to do this
I don't mind where we eat
It's entirely up to you
I can't find one of my shoes
Let's split a pizza
With him, you never know
Was he aware of it?
I'm not pulling your leg
That's gotta hurt
It won't hurt Tom to wait
They don't want to hurt you
It couldn't hurt to look
He's my father's son
I'm not a patriot
Don't let it end like this
You did let him go?
I don't even remember
I'm no patriot
Easy peasy!
Matthew's cheeks got so red
Matthew fell, too
How could Matthew know?
Michael tried calling 911
Look, will-o'-the-wisps!
The dog's barking woke me up
We're going to the theatre
It's good that nobody got hurt
I don't like this kind of talk
Which floor does Mary live on?
What floor does Mary live on?
Outside, it was extremely dark
She doesn't have a boyfriend
Let's go, Tom!
You'll fall
My ferret's name is Cookie
We're on a construction site
I don't even use that anymore
I don't even use it anymore
What's a matta?
What's BOFA?
Bofa deez nuts.
What do you say about my work?
What do you say about it?
I'm a straight guy
Where do you keep the turner?
He's fucking hot, masculine
Tom!
I've lived three lives
It's thirty-three degrees
I'd become a shitty father
I'd been a selfish bastard
I'd never let anybody hurt you
Does your foot still hurt?
I've hurt my arm
So, how's America doing?
Holy shit!
He gave me a half-smile
We're on a very tight schedule
The lid wasn't on tight
They are a tightly-knit group
Had you noticed?
Have you noticed?
Did you notice?
Hadn't you noticed?
Did you notice any difference?
I hadn't noticed that
Who told your about this?
Who told your about the party?
Who told you where to park?
I didn't detect it
Don't mess with Michael!
Or else what?
Go ask Michael.
It's not the same.
It's a glorious day
Can you walk?
I think so.
Michael's arm hurts really bad
Hold on!
I am not gay!
I know Michael isn't gay
I must say I'm impressed
We're gonna cut down the woods
Is the town OK with that?
Do you really need more money?
Michael obviously can't walk
Michael's match was postponed
Michael won't forgive Linda
Michael's heart suddenly sank
Where are you going?
To see Michael.
I'm coming with you.
Prove yourself.
In what way?
Figure it out.
Linda dated the mayor's son
With that, Michael stormed off
Michael couldn't help blushing
Keep it together, Michael
Did you steal all of these?
I'll tell you everything
Please hear me out, OK?
Michael needs Linda's support
Michael doesn't have a son
It's a good thing Michael won
I like Googoo Gaga.
You mean Lady Gaga?
Yeah!
What did I say?
With that, Michael walked away
Man, I can't talk to you
I know what I'm doing
Peanut brains!
Moron!
He's stinking rich
Is Algiers where you are from?
To Michael, Linda was a threat
Who compiled this list?
How long is your list?
Here's a list of options
Can I see the price list?
I'll add your name to the list
It'll be better from now on
This is just too much!
It's just a misdemeanor
I'd like you to live with me
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Oh, so she's single?
No, she's a lesbian.
I miss you so much, my love
Why do you care, Tom?
It's science
I think I'd better leave
Is that normal?
I don't know.
I know she'll never come back
Is that normal?
How would I know?
Do I look normal to you?
Tom isn't rich, but poor
I know he'll never come back
So, why not delete Twitter?
And give up my platform?
And give up my reach?
He drives like a nutter!
He's a back-seat driver
I'd rather he drove himself
I'm extremely upset
I'm extremely upset
Mary's left unannounced
Yes, yes, get to the point!
What's this about?
Tom!
Flowers?
You mean these weeds?
You told me to pull them up!
I'm not transphobic
I can't get comfortable
What's the score?
We're one-nil down.
How long left?
Who is the strongest?
Who's the strongest?
Don't be late
We won't wait for anyone
Don't be late
Don't be late
We're not waiting for anyone
Hasn't he seen you?
Didn't he see you?
Of course she's waiting for me
It's weird, isn't it?
This book costs 23.50
No one likes a know-all
Congratulations!
You've given birth to a son
Congratulations!
Up yours," said the frog
Michael's mom scolded him
Michael covered Linda's mouth
The director shouted: "Cut!
Security, kick this man out!
They're all in love
Tell me immediately!
It's not fair.
Life is not fair.
Michael didn't call either
Michael's head was spinning
Michael's hands were sweating
Michael's heart was pounding
Michael can't take his phone
The money was in Linda's purse
Here's the train fare
I've been selfish
That was fucking amazing!
I don't drink powdered milk
Michael didn't even flinch
Michael's room was ginormous
Michael was on Dad's side
Michael didn't take the job
Are lions afraid of hyenas?
It's time you pay
Michael grabbed Linda's ankle
He's trained to do that
How can .999... be equal to 1?
Why is .999... equal to 1?
Do your feet still hurt?
There's a deafening silence
That's how it looks
That's how it looks to me
How nice my love is!
We painted Tom's office
I don't like the smell of it
I don't like the smell of this
It's Pi Day
I can recite pi to 300 digits.
That's the stairway to heaven
You're high on your own supply
I'm not trying to split hairs
You always say you're sorry!
I've been thinking about it
I'd like to slap him
My pocket's empty
It's almost too much to handle
How can DeSantis believe that?
He doesn't.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Oh, so she's lesbian?
No, she's just single.
Source?
Trust me, bro!
She's not a girl
Nothing, my love
Yes, my love.
And the bathroom?
I had no time for...
Hurry up!
What do you do?
I'm a househusband.
No, I mean for work.
It is my work.
Yes, we can do much better!
I dare you!
It's eighth grade biology.
Child abuse!
Grooming!
What's that like?
Have at thee!
What's your new car like?
I'm not the only Canadian here
Canadians aren't like that
Welcome to Hell!
Wait, there's actually a Hell?
I have so many questions.
Shut up!
Let's write to Robert
Robert wasn't in his office
Why is Robert so negative?
Why are you so negative?
I'm being practical.
Robert's dad has been arrested
Can we be friends again?
Martha got a D again.
You're a darling, Martha!
Robert!
Someone help him!
What's your name?
I'm Robert.
I don't even know you anymore
That was so shallow of you!
You love me?
Then what about Martha?
I love you, dummy!
Dinner tonight?
As long as it's not chicken.
I love you!
I love you more!
You should stop by room 40
Robert didn't heart that often
Stop calling them Mom and Dad!
You're not their daughter!
It's my family legacy
Just then, Robert stormed off
Robert heard Martha's secret
Robert doesn't know the words
Robert will help Martha, too
Robert's day was off
Robert is a slug, now
Sometimes, Robert failed
Robert's dog was also dead
Robert's tumor is bening
Robert doesn't like the beach
Skating is Robert's whole life
Suddenly, the door pushed open
Where did you pop up from?
It's freezing this morning
Tom isn't married
Don't touch my mustache
That didn't even cross my mind
That's a line I wouldn't cross
Don't forget to cross your t's
I'll meet you guys there
Let's meet at the main gate
My name's Tom
How did you meet each other?
Let's meet each other halfway
We need to meet face-to-face
Who is the king of Spain?
Why do you hate freedom?
Robert's message appeared
Hi, my name is Mary
Hi, my name's Mary
It's too hot, Mom
I can't eat
Who will determine the winner?
Don't trust Robert too much
Biology is transphobic, too
Let's declare war on biology
Let's declare war on science
Who's the king?
Who is the king?
Robert didn't turn back
It's useless to run
It's useless to escape
Can I really go out?
Can you light the campfire?
Finally, the stove caught fire
Just then, Robert appeared
Robert wasn't wearing a badge
I'm so sick of your face
Robert rushed to Sandra's door
Robert's face looked worried
Is this a curable disease?
Can you invite me along?
Robert's house was dark
Suddenly, Robert stopped
Robert can't eat that food
Robert visited Sandra's grave
It's Robert!
What the fudge!
Robert's hands were so warm
He's a sleepwalker
Robert ridiculed Sandra, too
Give me that book over there!
Behave!
What time do they close?
Robert doesn't need a mask
Congratulations!
It's a boy!
Robert couldn't believe it
Don't be a drama queen!
Definitely not cheese.
You didn't pay the latte
Robert wasn't about to give up
Are your eyes working fine?
She's married!
Am I not good enough for you?
Robert helped Sandra, too
Do you want to know who won?
Robert sighed, but agreed
Get out!
We need to change!
Get out!
What a jerk!
After all, Robert was so cute
Robert can't run very fast
Luckily, Robert didn't notice
Is this a lipstick?
It's my mom's.
Robert can't play this game
Eventually, Robert dozed off
Can I lie down on the couch?
Did Cookie go poop?
I’ve known him all my life
It's still a work in progress
Did Cookie do a number two?
Did Cookie do his business?
I don't have my key
What kind of crap is this?
I really shouldn't have gone
I can show you.
Exactly!
Have you spilt some sugar?
Who helped you?
I did it all myself.
Can you say the same?
Why didn't you bring Tom?
I'd have loved to meet him
I don't fancy tea now
How come you're home already?
Have you asked him?
I'm on a roll today
Let's roll
A tear rolled down Tom's cheek
That's my biggest dream
It doesn't hurt to dream
That was Tom's lifelong dream
It's every girl's dream
William doesn't envy Sandra
William was accident-prone
This throne is mine now.
I don't care.
William can't fool everyone
Get out!
What the fudge!
Are you kidding me?
Get off me!
You're so annoying!
William went back to 2004
Can you give up smoking?
William's face looked sad
You've matured a lot!
William has grown so much, too
Has William been arrested?
William won't make it back
William's vision went white
William won't be staying here
The guards didn't cooperate
Does anyone want to volunteer?
It's okay to be crazy
William won't tell the police
William was Sandra's henchman
Why is the television on?
Hi, I'm Nancy
It got very dark, very quickly
You can't trust politicians
Don't cross this line
There's no water in that tank
We didn't want Tom to do that
I couldn't get the hang of it
We can't hang on to the past
We've run out of syrup
People don't like change
We've changed our schedule
We didn't change anything
Why did you make that change?
Why was this change necessary?
Why do we need to change this?
We've made a huge mistake
It must've been my mistake
It wasn't a mistake after all
One mistake and you're fired
I'm sorry
Perhaps we've made a mistake
That's a common typing mistake
That's a common typing error
To millennia more of Hebrew!
You complete me.
No I don't
You're complete without me.
This is a car of Tom's
What is life without love?
One can't put back the clock
Has Tom made progress?
Tom said I'd made a mistake
Will Tom ever change?
Why should Tom change?
We've made several changes
Now I've got a bellyache
No one likes a know-it-all
I'm good at football
We're footballers
He's really into football
I'm as thick as a plank
I'm sorry about what I said
What's your favourite music?
I'm wearing Tom's old pyjamas
Unfortunately, he didn't come
I'm a citizen of Canada
What does she hope for today?
It's fairly simple to explain
It's quite easy to explain
Tom thinks I'm a criminal
I don't think he'll go
He probably won't go
If I can do it, you can, too
It's about you and me
If I can do it, you can do it
I'd just got back from a trip
I hope you won't be angry now
I hope you won't be cross now
It's easy to get sucked in
He's livestreaming it
The air is thin there..
We'll meet Tom at noon today
Did you enjoy your day off?
Will you give it to Tom?
Cookie's nose is cold and wet
Don't read this book!
When will this movie end?
I'll come even if it rains
OK, I'll prove that it works
Don't make me prove it to you
I'll prove you wrong
That'll be hard to prove
We can't prove any of it
I'd like to know you better
You've just proven my point
We couldn't prove our theory
We can't prove Tom did that
Has that been proven?
Can you prove that's true?
That's been proven repeatedly
Tom thinks I'm annoying
We don't have any proof yet
What was Tom trying to prove?
Tom can't prove that
Is Egyptian still spoken?
We've made little headway
We've just had a jump in sales
He's currently employed
Let's jump to the last step
What are you up to?
You're in it up to your neck
We shook hands, and he left
He's definitely hitting on me
Don't jump the gun
I'll give you what you deserve
Will Tom need me?
It's very clogged
It's clogged
You're playing The Game
The rules say so.
I don't accept those rules.
I can't play this game
That's my spin on it
Tom is John's sidekick
Where'd Tom and Mary go?
How was the salad?
How was the steak?
How was your sandwich?
How was your visit?
How did you get permission?
How are vaccines made?
How did you pay for that?
How did that movie end?
How did that become a law?
How was boot camp?
How was the conference?
How was the theft discovered?
How was the fraud uncovered?
How did you find this cave?
You're in a cult
How crowded was the bus?
Define "good.
They won't stop at that
Please don't read my diary
Don't you dare read my diary!
William's love is true
Don't you dare, Tom!
William couldn't find Sandra
William saw Sandra's eyes
William is running late, too
William wanted that, too
Why are you named Ziri?
Isn't this room 404§
William doesn't get jealous
Let go!
You're hurting me!
Talk to me when you're calm
William did that, not Sandra
William left school, too
William's emotions flared up
William also felt self-love
William's emotions exploded
William didn't deny his affair
Don't overdo it like that
Who talked to Tom?
Who talked to Tom about that?
Who discussed that with Tom?
Obviously, William cried again
Will William take the risk?
William's face worsened
I've got three cats around me
It's always so quiet here
Tom's car is very quiet
Have I said anything stupid?
That's a stupid exuce
What do we want for our party?
Don't touch Tom's wheelchair
I don't believe in God anymore
Can you imagine how I felt?
How dare you say such a thing?
Someone's nicked my stuff
I've stopped believing in God
There'll be ample
Draw it for me, you guys
Make an effort, guys
We're kohanim
We're Orthodox priests
We're Christian priests
We're kohens
Finally, Tom has arrived
Finally, Tom gave in
We're finally out of the red
We've finally gotten started
Do you want to live healthily?
What's in the green packet?
What is 17 plus 60?
They can't speak freely
He can't speak freely
You'd better lie down
Don't eat too many figs
What startled her?
What frightened her?
It's really warm today
Do you guys smoke weed?
I don't smoke crack.
Good for you.
It's all about meth for me.
It's older than MRIs
You're a bit dumb
Don't go to sleep
If you do, you'll die
Dr. Jackson is a urologist
Don't fall asleep
If you do, you'll die
Don't fall asleep
If you fall asleep, you'll die
You mind if I smoke a joint?
Forty is Elias's number
Elias didn't score
I'm sure Elias will show up
Why's the TV off?
Elias fixed Sandra's Barbie
Elias fixed Sandra's doll
Elias held on to Sandra's hand
I'd rather not speak up
Admittedly, I was so startled
I'm three times as big as you
Elias's style was flamboyant
Elias's profession is a model
It was exactly 5:30
Elias doesn't have to resign
Elias was the chairman's son
Elias's hair was combed
Elias didn't receive any gifts
Elias is a blood-sucking demon
And finally, God helped Elias
What has Elias done for you?
Where is that woman now?
Her name is Sandy..
Are you cheating on Elias?
Elias can't control himself
Elias sold his dad's house
He hid at his relative's
I'm with them
You can't strip a naked man
He's losing his way
I can't do anything to you
I'm pretty distrustful
Can you find it on a map?
He'll give me it
Are they healthy?
Does your dad have relatives?
I demand that he be there!
It's not blackmail
It's some friendly advice
Which cow is theirs?
Young people like "Le Peura
You don't have any siblings?
Do you like her?
I don't know.
Are you telling truth?
It was such a relief!
Where did my sister go?
You're such a pig!
Are you glad I came round?
What is he playing at?
Free Ukraine!
Does she know you're here?
Tom's hobby is cooking
Don't worry
I'll clean it up
I'd never laughed that much
He's still a man
Don't just stand there!
But why take the risk?
Why is it so dark?
What is the purpose of it?
Are there any fries here?
Why aren't you Catholic?
She's not one of us
They're getting ready to leave
Are you Italian?
She interrupts me non-stop
He's cooking ox tongue
I'd never want to hurt you
They're both at home
We can do better than that!
What are you scheming?
What are you plotting?
Does it belong to you?
I didn't want to respond
Are you guys Italian?
It's me who's looking at you
She's rolling in her grave
I've read your arrest report
I'm placing your under arrest
We won't arrest you today
You don't look Canadian.
What?!
World Poetry Day is March 21st
Tom didn't resist arrest
Where did they arrest Tom?
Tom made a citizen's arrest
What exactly is prose poetry?
We're going to an open mic
Life really isn't easy
It hurts, doesn't it?
I miss you, I want to see you
He's madly in love with you
Are you coming this weekend?
I'm excited to read you
They do everything?
I can't see anything anymore
What is the main theme?
Poor countess!
Throw your weapon here!
Leave with Jean!
He doesn't care about me
He responded: I'll come
Never!
He's a food lover
How many stars does he have?
I'm not pushing them
Birds of prey don't sing
You're lying to your wives
Why didn't you buy a guitar?
How old is Tom Jackson now?
Elias wasn't going to work out
Elias wasn't working out
What's up?
We don't need him
Elias just wouldn't listen
Elias yanked Sandra's necklace
Elias didn't know his way back
Elias came to Sandra's town
Elias?
I can't believe my eyes!
I'm so happy to see you here!
Elias's journey was finished
Elias wasn't there yet
That's for your betrayal!
You're definitely right
I haven't heard that one yet!
Tom's advice helped a lot
What were you advised to do?
I'd advise you not to buy that
Ms. Jackson is my advisor
Ms. Jackson is my adviser
I'd advise you to lay low
I've done what you advised
I'd advise you to reconsider
I advised Tom to come by 2:30
I'd advise you to leave
I'd advise you to wear a suit
Where are you, you cowards?
Quit complaining and climb!
I never believed in it!
Wake up, Marie!
It's half past eight
We won't tell him anything
We won't tell her anything
I'll buy him some cherries
I'll buy her some cherries
We're attending the burial
He left, leaving no trace
It's a scam!
Where are my newspapers?
Do you want to go in my place?
Marie's feeling better
Who ate my food?
Don't blow this opportunity
The wind blew Mary's dress up
I don't want to blow this
Tom didn't know it either
Beat it!
You're spreading fake news
Translate the text, please
He's open to dialogue
He isn't really the party type
Hello, Anna!
Given what any thought?
Oh, you know.
No, I don't know
Help jog my memory.
It's good that you're here
It's good that you're here!
I hoped you'd come
It's a full moon
Don't panic
Who knew her son?
Who knew their son?
No, I've got a meeting at two.
You'll understand when you see
I won't die completely
Oh, he's long since over it.
Don't shout!
I'm not shouting
I'm calmness personified.
Don't shout!
I'm not shouting
I'm calm itself.
That'll calm you down
It's a pity you have to leave
It's a shame you have to go
I'll pour myself another
Be more careful in future.
Yes, sir.
All right, you can go.
I'm sorry
Have I done everything right?
If you want, you can wait
Let's talk on the way
It's not always easy to say no
Which of them is yours?
Is that in Spain or France?
Aren't you well?
I've got a splitting headache.
Don't you feel well?
I've got a splitting headache.
Have you got a pen?
Yeah.
Are you travelling alone?
How should I answer?
How should I reply?
That night, it was really dark
Did you have fun at the mall?
Did you draw these pictures?
Are you feeling insecure?
They'd had a big fight
My fiancée is a Canadian
He didn't trust strangers
I've locked myself in
Elias doesn't eat out
The men weren't just skinny
Mum, the dogs are hungry
Mum, where's the sugar?
She’s probably at home
What's your name, by the way?
Elias still didn't emerge
Elias didn't return that night
Isn't he your old boss?
Yeah, you're right!
Do not follow his advice!
What does she know about it?
Leave my kittens alone!
Robert is a man, not a boy
He's an outdoorsman
William, wake up!
I'm usually an outgoing guy
I didn't find what to say
Have you finished gossiping?
Your idea is worthless.
Do you speak French?

Does Tom drink?
Come in, Tom
Is this Tom's car?
Where's the proof?
Be careful, Tom
Why is Tom quitting?
I'm used to the heat
It's October already
It's already October
We can't count on Tom
Why are you quitting?
Will doing that help?
Isn't Tom from Boston?
Let's go to hear the lesson.
But how is your father?
Well, thanks be to God.
Why are you so kind to me?
You'd better answer that
I'm sorry, I need to take that
We'll meet again one day
Tom's car screeched to a halt
Why are you crying?
Because I'm so happy.
Tom's voice is soothing
Mary's voice is soothing
They're charismatic
They're conscientious
They're cruel
They're extroverted
I don't throw rocks at anyone
He's full of shit
Lions don't meow
Has any one passed this way?'
Which way did the woman go?
What a lovely thing a rose is!
The board-schools.
Light-houses, my boy!
Beacons of the future!
Where are we going to now?
I asked, as we left the office
Any news?" he asked, eagerly
Come out into the sunshine!
Come out into the sunshine!
No, thank you, Joseph
It'll get better
God bless you!" he cried
You have saved my honour.
God bless you!" he cried
You have saved my honour.
I can't accept this situation
My God!" gasped our client
So it was.
My head whirls," said he
Your words have dazed me.
Sami won't believe Layla
Sami's religion is not for me
Sami couldn't explain that
Sami can't explain this
Sami didn't pass the drug test
Sami's parents accepted Layla
Sami's parents liked Layla
Sami doesn't have a religion
Sami hasn't prayed yet
Sami doesn't know how to pray
Sami can't be forgiven
What does Tom need from us?
You are afraid of something?
Is Mrs. Watson in?
Never.
Let me ask you a question, Tom
Please keep my secret!
What did you tell him?
The truth.
What did you tell her?
The truth.
Does he know the way?
What did you tell Tom?
I told him the truth.
How much do I owe her?
Does he love you?
I don't know.
Does she love you?
I don't know.
How is married life?
How soon can you do it?
I've reconsidered your offer
Hello, this is Tom
Can I speak to Mary?
Hi, this is Tom
Can I speak to Mary?
You're going to do what?
They're skinny
They're thin
We've lost her
Actually, it's a comedy
How would you say it?
You're going to do what?
I'm going to kill someone.
Are you out of your mind?
I didn't want Tom to go
Did you try the chicken?
Are those your students?
I didn't want Tom there
Has Tom finished eating?
Please don't park here
Is it October already?
Is Tom drinking coffee?
I'm used to the smell
I'm coming in October
I'll be ready by 2:30
Could you help me out?
I'm going to kiss Tom
Are Kabyle women beautiful?
Why did he accuse my son?
Why did Yidir accuse my son?
Why is she bothering me?
It's going to be quite cold
He has escaped!
Moriarty?
He has given them the slip.
It is indeed, a fearful place
You did not write this?
You did not write this?
Certainly not!" he cried
You guys did an awesome job!
Tom is self-righteous
God answered Tom's prayers
God answered Mary's prayers
That's enough
Okay, you two
That's enough
I'm sorry you had to hear that
Wow, that's so cool
Shoot!
October isn't so far off
Isn't Tom from Australia?
I've gotten used to that
I wasn't here in October
If Tom calls, wake me up
That didn't seem to bother Tom
Why do you want to stay?
What time's your curfew?
I didn't want to play with Tom
I won't be able to do that
Nobody's died so far
No one's died so far
I've never seen him again
Why did you buy that hat?
Does Tom live around here?
It'll make you feel better
You didn't finish your drink
Fuck your mom, bastard
You're free to use this room
It's no use arguing about it
I didn't want Tom to stay
That's definitely not true
When did you buy that hat?
I'll follow you
We're going to sell our house
Stand to attention!
That's gross!
I'll talk about poems
Let's hope that you are cured
I want to go home!
Tom's mother was exasperated
It gives me the heebie-jeebies
You've almost got it
Alright, you two that's enough
It's a complex question
I'm a boy
How can we get out of here?
How much will you get paid?
How much will Tom get paid?
I'll be leaving in October
Let's drink something else
I can't get Tom to do that
Mary doesn't wear lipstick
Please don't do that today
I'll fix you a drink
I'll fix a drink for you
I'll fix you breakfast
I'll make breakfast for you
I'll fix breakfast for you
We're eating inside
Tom is easy-going and fun
We'll make up for the loss
It's no use going there
I couldn't make the train
I didn't make the train
Tom didn't drink the milk
Tom didn't drink that milk
There's no use making excuses
Didn't Tom suspect anything?
Who's supposed to help you?
Why didn't you come by bus?
He cheated on her!
He cheated on him!
What a bad life!
What a hard reality!
It is not that way my dear!
Suddenly, they appeared to me
I'm preparing dinner
I'm preparing the lunch
Please, look ahead!
It's not a problem at all!
Your computer can't work!
He had the golden touch!
They are only good at gabbing!
The Kabyle language is rich!
The snake doesn't kiss!
It's female mimicry
He lifted earth and sky!
Sleep well, darling!
No, daddy
Is he coming?
See you tonight!
Seek and you shall find!
Drink milk!
Go left!
There is no coincidence!
What does Mitsubishi mean?
What a sourpuss!
It's a golden family
Any luck?
Does that name ring a bell?
Hello, gorgeous
Can we use this as a weapon?
Do you know any card tricks?
How much butter do you want?
I can't help the way I feel
I don't celebrate birthdays
Is this Tom Jackson's house?
Are you having any luck?
Do you feel prepared?
Who is playing the violin?
Who's playing the violin?
I'd like to cash this check
I burped and Tom burped, too
I'd love to do that for you
I've made some bad decisions
In October, I was in Boston
I can't allow Tom to do that
I don't like to argue
I don't like arguing
What's your favourite city?
What's your favourite town?
Anne Frank wasn't a citizen
Let's sing and make music!
How fast does that bird fly?
Enjoy the rest of the weekend!
I'm going to the control room
Mr. Grimm is a history teacher
Good day, Sir!
Can I see my son?
To be honest, I don't like him
Why do you learn Spanish?
That's the press freedom
Buy a nice dress!
I don't speak with Tom
They talk a lot for nothing!
What is this all about here?
Don’t open old wounds
It's not meant to be
Things shouldn't be like this
It's completely disgraceful
“Holmes!”
“Is it really you?
Good Heavens!
“You’ll come with me tonight?”
Well, then, about that chasm
Let's meet again in October
Mary doesn't shave her legs
I didn't want Tom to find me
you'll come with me tonight?
When you like, where you like!

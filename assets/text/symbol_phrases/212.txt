Are they even really friends?
It's a pleasure for me
I'll never forgive you, Tom
I'll never hurt you, Tom
He's just teasing you

At least, that's what he said
At least, that's what she said
You mustn't flatter me
She looked tired, but happy
Tom looked tired, but happy

Don't be like that.
Like what?

I know Tom's sister
Did Tom kiss you?
Did you really kiss Tom?
Did you kiss Tom?
That's absurd!
Fine, you don't have to
Take a nap if you're tired
I didn't really mean that

Tom told me he wasn't sleepy
Tom told me he wasn't hungry
Tom told me he wasn't busy

How many flowers do you buy?
Another glass of beer, please
I'll see as I walk along
Why don't we order the pizza?
Tom is a friend of my friend's
I'll fire at you
I don't like sand
I hate him, too
I hate her, too
It's not googleable
I won't follow you
I won't do anything
The girl saw it, too
I don't choose you
You'll soon feel better
Come on, Tom, bust him up!
Why can't we have pizza?
I don't have any son
Don't let your guard down
Tom doesn't get the situation
What is my prize?
What is so special?

She's on vacation
Do you think he'll like it?
I'll speak with him alone
Do you want more than that?
Steffi, will you marry me?
How much money do you have?
Are we cool yet?
Is it okay if I don't show up?
Is that okay?
No, it's not okay.
That's imitation leather
Sorry, I have church on Sunday
I won't stand for it anymore
He's preparing for the journey
I won't tolerate it anymore
I won't tolerate that anymore

Tom's hair has turned gray
Have you eaten seafood?
Shellfish, let's say
How typical of Tom.
I'd like to meet Tom's father
Mary, are you decent?
You can only take out 60 euros
That's it
It's not an insult
It's an observation
I'll be very attentive
How can this be?
I don't care how you feel
I'm sure we'll find a solution
It's easy to tell them apart
If we don't do it, who will?
I'm not sleepy anymore
Tom's dog is a mutt
We don't drink enough water
Have you ever considered it?
Mary's neighbor is a busybody
It's too foggy
I can't see a thing
I'm counting on you guys
It's a complicated story
What team do you support?
Police line: do not cross
That's dry information
That's a very dry explanation
In my opinion, Tom is innocent
This isn't a real diamond
I'm going to move next month
These diamonds aren't real
Now I'm fairly healthy again
I'll summarize it all

It's not new
I'm Canadian, too
I'll save it
How was that?
Don't waste it
Don't look up
You're wrong
Can you take a break?
You won't win
Why change it?
We've run out of kerosene
We've run out of gasoline

We're not done
We're doing OK
We're bankrupt
We're all safe
We'll make it
We aren't sure what to do
Tom's the boss
Tom's not weak
Tom isn't afraid
Tom died at 65
They're young
They're close
They'll grow
They'll fail
They won't die
They couldn't help us
That's not love
That's my dad
That's doable
That's a start
That'd be fun
That'd be cool
Now let's talk
No one's upset
Let's get real
Let's get busy
Let's end this
It's very cheap
It's expensive
It's about this big
It'll be hot tomorrow
It isn't wrong
It isn't cheap
It didn't help
Is Tom your son?
Is Tom next?
Is Tom a member?
Is this a hoax?
Is that unfair?
Is it that bad?
I've done that
I've already paid for it
I'm very lucky
I'm too young
I'm still angry
I'm paid enough
I'm here, too
I'll miss that
I'll go see it
I was inspired by Tom's speech
I didn't study
How far was it?
How do we help?
How did we win?
Do you need it now?
Do they work here?
Did you notice any errors?
Can we move it?
Are we on time?
I'll give you an example
I've seen a lot of cool things
I'd like to believe otherwise
When you cry, you cry alone
Without water, there's no life
That's the logical thing to do

That had to be blind luck!
I have to wake up at 6:30

Is Tom that bad?
Is Tom out there?
Is Tom confident?
Is this serious?
Is this natural?
Is this ethical?
Is this correct?
Is that too hard?
Is that healthy?
Is it hazardous?
Is it clear now?
Is it all wrong?
I've got it all
I'm retired, too
I'm quite happy
I'm not allowed to help you
I'm glad we did that
I'm a happy man
I'd better go, too
I won't buy one
I held Tom's hand
I don't mind it
I don't eat out very often
I didn't speak
I didn't sleep
I can't open this jar
I can't keep it
I can't join you
I can't feel it
Has Tom been fired yet?
Go to Tom's house
Don't back away
Don't attack me
Do I look tired?
Could that be Tom?
Can you afford it?
Can we fix this?
Can I afford it?
Can anyone help?
Are you envious?
Are you at work?
Don't obey your boss blindly
I bet you're talking about Tom
What's his teacher's name?
Too many to remember!
Are you going out with anyone?
Chicks'll dig me!
I can't go on like that

I don't need dinner
What time do you think it is?
That's just the problem
Is there any bread?
Is it included in the price?
Don't screw with me!
Tom didn't know Mary
Savvy?
You're all hypocritical
If I want, they will kill her
If I want, they will kill you
Don't stand in my way
Stay out of my business!
How many secrets can you keep?
So have you got the guts?
Do I wanna know?
That's what you call good luck
You are not looking!
Which word?
Can you write it down?
You still think I'm bluffing?
What's your favorite language?
I'm too much of a lazybones
I know something!
Where's my little princess?
It's my passion
Isn't that a pity?
I hate doing this stuff!
Tom, don't listen to them!
I think Tom's here
He said it was nine o'clock
What kind of stain is that?
I'll go wash my hands
How much did you pay for this?
Like 20 euros.
That's crazy cheap!
Are you serious?
Me?
Yes, you!
Could I have a spoon?
There's no coffee left
I'd like to ask a favor
Yes, what about it?
Is love just a game to you?
It's all Toma's doing
Don't hurry, be happy!
I hope you won't sing
Tell her I'm hungry
What is this flower called?
He's afraid
Must we wait for them here?

There isn't anyone here but us
At first, I was puzzled
Look Tom, it's stopped raining
You were really good, too
Are you happy now?
Yes, I am.
I'm going to be famous one day

That infernal home!
You are sloth!
Dad, I am pregnant
Tom swallowed a chewing-gum
I'm a big child

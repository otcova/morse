It's not quite clear
It's not their money
It's not very common
I'm glad that Tom got caught
It's offensive to me
It's orange in color
Tom didn't have children
It's pretty far away
My car isn't as big as Tom's
It's quiet out there
It's red, not orange
Tom doesn't like anybody
It's simply not fair
That's not all Tom had to do
It's simply not true
It's slow, very slow
It's time to confess
That's not all Tom has to do
It's tough out there
It's tough right now
It's up to our board
It's up to us to ask
It's very, very good
It's very, very hard
It's way better here
It's what artists do
It's what coaches do
It's why you're here
Just don't look down
I told Tom that we're friends
Kids are people, too
Tom said he loved me, too
Let's try doing that
Life isn't like that
Life's not like that
Maybe it's like that
Tom doesn't earn very much
Something isn't right with Tom
Money can't buy that
Tom knew he'd been wronged
Can I get there by bus?
One day isn't enough
Tom didn't take his mask off
Tom didn't take off his mask
Tom didn't tell anybody else
That can happen, too
That didn't work out
Tom hasn't yet paid for that
That isn't an option
Tom didn't turn off the light
Tom didn't turn the light off
Are you having panic attacks?
That wasn't too hard
That won't affect us
That won't last long
That's a common myth
That's not all, folks
That's a fire hazard
That's the best part
Tom says he doesn't feel well
That's a great asset
That's the good news
What's the real goal?
That's the sad truth
That's up for debate
That's a lovely idea
That's a new message
That's a proven fact
Where's the volume control?
That's a rare luxury
I'm Filipino
That's a red herring
That's all I can see
That's all I'm doing
That's all we wanted
Tom didn't know I was sleeping
That's going too far
That's great to hear
That's how we'll win
Tom didn't seem to mind at all
That's in poor taste
That's just about it
That's just my guess
That's just not cool
That's my goal today
That's my main focus
That's my only focus
Don't throw stones at cats
That's my only worry
The game starts 2:30
Tom said he didn't need a ride
This won't last long
Where is your helmet?
You're from a cow?!
No, I'm from Macau.
It's yours to enjoy
What was resolved?
Who wants to start?
Can we meet at the park?
It will endure forever!
I've finished already
It's not a sharp pain
It's perfect as it is
It's what teachers do
Let's try it that way
That didn't offend me
That's not a priority
Was anybody surprised?
How are you kids doing?
Is there any other way?
Is this already cooked?
It wasn't fun to watch
It's about time to eat
It's what musicians do
He ordered a two-topping pizza
It's an environmental disaster
Many people don't care
Maybe I won't be there
He doesn't miss Algeria
Nothing.
Today we're in Algeria
Of course, we're angry
He lives in Bejaia, Algeria
That doesn't affect me
He's traveling around Algeria
He grew up in Bejaia, Algeria
He came to Algeria in 2004
When did you move to Algeria?
He didn't move to Algeria
Do you like Algeria?
Don't come to Algeria
I was born in Bejaia, Algeria
Of course I'm Algerian
I'm 100% Algerian
I'm totally Algerian
It's cold in Algeria
Don't come to Algiers
What is Algeria like?
That isn't our problem
He's not staying in Algeria
She's a fellow Algerian
They're mostly Algerian
Why are you coming to Algeria?
I'm in Algeria
That's a big advantage
That's a critical fact
I'd like to talk to him
She doesn't like cheese
He's bigger than me
He isn't a lazy child
She's always late
She wonders if it's true
She's hiding under the table
She's away on a business trip
She's dying for that cake
That's a powerful idea
That's a strange thing
That's also true today
That's an amazing plan
That's flat out racist
That's just an opinion
That's our major focus
Don't make things complicated
That's why you're here
This isn't new anymore
I didn't get a tax refund

It's show time
I can't walk fast
I don't want help
That isn't Tom's forte
Boston isn't that far away
That's not my goal
What did you see, Nancy?
My plan didn't work
That's not Tom's forte
That's what's scary
A small cup of coffee costs €2
A small cup of coffee is €2
You'd better stay in bed
That's for the birds
That isn't an excuse
That isn't clear yet
That isn't that hard
That's a real relief
That's not an excuse
That's not clear yet
That's not that hard
That's our game plan
That's our goal here
That's our main goal
That's the next step
She's a responsible driver
He's a professor of literature
That's the real goal
That's what it takes
That's what we'll do
I'm sure I'll miss Australia
There's no such rule
There's no time left
You can't keep those
Many Canadians don't do that
What's your main goal?
That isn't enough time
That's not enough time
That's what I'd prefer
Boston isn't all that far away
Tom doesn't want help
We aren't on an island
We're not on an island
Failure isn't an option
I felt that wasn't fair
I hope I don't get hurt
I'm afraid I'd get lost
I'm sorry I woke you up
I'm sorry we're so late
It's hot here, very hot
I'm sure you'll miss Australia
Let's go out for coffee
Look where you're going
We haven't visited Taiwan
We didn't visit Taiwan
One day won't be enough
That doesn't look right
Tom didn't seem to want one
That method didn't work
That's not all I wanted
Will Tom do that?
Maybe, but who cares?
The value isn't obvious
Would you like?
Tonight's party is BYOB
Children are people, too
Did you ask for a discount?
Tom laughed whole-heartedly
I'm not sure that's fair
It's a difficult process
Tom's car has heated seats
It's a three-week course
It's up to the committee
What made him so angry?
Many of us don't do that
That isn't my only worry
Why's he so annoyed?
He's not as young as I am
That's how it stands now
That's just plain stupid
That's my main focus now

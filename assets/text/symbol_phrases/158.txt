What were your teachers like?
What were you doing in there?
What were Tom and Mary doing?
What happened here yesterday?
What does that mean, exactly?
What do you want me to carry?
What did you do with my keys?
What did you do last weekend?
What are they doing in there?
Were you with Tom that night?
Were you at home all morning?
We've met before, haven't we?
We've met a few times before
We've had a misunderstanding
We've discussed this already
We're very worried about you
We're so sorry for your loss
We're all far from our homes
We'll start at nine tomorrow
We'll soon be busy, won't we?
We'll meet up with Tom later
We'll begin tomorrow morning
We'll all be dead eventually
Tom's not answering his cell
Tom's eyelids were half open
Tom's car was hit by a truck
Tom won't go to school today
Tom won't go along with that
Tom won't be working with me
Tom will take the 2:30 train
Tom wasn't totally surprised
Tom wasn't thinking straight
Tom wasn't the only survivor
Tom was Mary's first teacher
Tom was Mary's first husband
Tom wanted to finish by 2:30
Tom should've said something
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Tom says that he's very rich
Tom says that he's very busy
Tom said he doesn't eat meat
Tom said he didn't know Mary
Tom said he didn't feel well
Tom said he didn't feel safe
Tom said he didn't feel cold
Tom really doesn't like Mary
Tom realizes what's happened
Tom probably doesn't like it
Tom probably didn't hear you
Tom just doesn't fit in here
Tom isn't so good at singing
Tom isn't a college graduate
Tom is really busy, isn't he?
Tom is my next-door neighbor
Tom is laughing at you, Mary
Tom hasn't been arrested yet
Tom doesn't think it'll work
Tom doesn't need to know yet
Tom doesn't need to come yet
Tom doesn't look tired to me
Tom doesn't look happy to me
Tom doesn't look broke to me
Tom doesn't know you're here
Tom doesn't know that I know
Tom doesn't do much, does he?
Tom doesn't care how we feel
Tom didn't tell me about you
Tom didn't take his own life
Tom didn't say where he went
Tom didn't look like a freak
Tom didn't like me very much
Tom didn't let Mary kiss him
Tom didn't know who Mary was
Tom didn't know where it was
Tom didn't know what hit him
Tom didn't hear Mary come in
Tom didn't give me any money
Tom didn't call Mary, did he?
Tom didn't believe the rumor
Tom could've bought this car
Tom can't seem to avoid Mary
Tom and Mary weren't invited
Tom and Mary just don't care
Tom and Mary don't have much
Tom and Mary don't have kids
Tom and Mary aren't home yet
Tom and Mary aren't back yet
Tom already thinks I'm crazy
This isn't your place, is it?
This is Tom's idea, isn't it?
This is Tom, my ex-boyfriend
This is my daughter's school
There's no rule against that
The food hasn't been touched
That sounds like Tom's voice
Tell them that they're wrong
Technically, you're correct
Promise me you won't be late
One of them was Tom's friend
Maybe you shouldn't eat that
Maybe you didn't do it right
It's not time to go home yet
It's not like you to be late
It's likely Tom will be late
It's about time you got here
It's a good time for a party
I've never seen them so busy
I'm sure everything'll be OK
I'm really not all that busy
I'll check in with you later
I'd like to go there someday
I wish you didn't have to go
I know that Tom isn't hungry
I don't find that very funny
I can't believe Tom did that
Hey Tom, isn't that your cat?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
Has Tom eaten anything today?
Giving up smoking isn't easy
Don't you have to be at work?
Don't go anywhere without me
Doesn't Tom ever wear a suit?
Does Tom have an appointment?
Do you want to do this later?
Do you want to do that again?
Do you want a glass of water?
Do you really hate that idea?
Do you have a recommendation?
Do we really have to do that?
Did Tom say when he'd arrive?
Couldn't Tom have been lying?
Consider this a warning, Tom
Can I help you with anything?
Are you saying Tom is a liar?
Are you going to pay in cash?
Are you coming to pick me up?
Your T-shirt's on backwards
Your sweater's on backwards
You're wanted by the police
You're thirty minutes early
You're the person in charge
You're not that interesting
You're needed in the clinic
You're asking the wrong guy
You're all busy, aren't you?
You'll be the first to know
You'd better not drink that
You'd better listen to this
You were happy, weren't you?
You must've had a hard time
You must've had a good time
You hate small towns, right?
Why did you say that to Tom?
Why did you have to do that?
Why did they do this to you?
Why are you wearing my coat?
Why are you procrastinating?
Why are you in your pajamas?
Why are you doing this here?
Where were you this morning?
Where have you been, anyway?
What're you looking at, Tom?
What're you doing with this?
What're you doing with that?
What're you doing in Boston?
What were you in prison for?
What were we supposed to do?
What were Tom and Mary told?
What does that mean, anyway?
What did you have for lunch?
What are you smirking about?
We've studied it thoroughly
We're not out of danger yet
We're going to be just fine
We're glad to have you here
We don't need anything else
We aren't yet out of danger
Tom's phone started ringing
Tom's office door is closed
Tom's not feeling very well
Tom's eyes started to water
Tom won't have to wait long
Tom won't even listen to us
Tom won't come until Monday
Tom won't be very effective
Tom wears a toupee, I think
Tom was mistaken, of course
Tom thought we shouldn't go
Tom thinks I'm exaggerating
Tom says he didn't hit Mary
Tom said Mary couldn't swim
Tom said he didn't feel hot
Tom recognized Mary's voice
Tom must've had his reasons
Tom may be back before 2:30
Tom knew Mary wasn't hungry
Tom isn't my responsibility
Tom isn't interested either
Tom isn't in Boston anymore
Tom isn't bothering anybody
Tom is wearing John's shoes
Tom hasn't done anything yet
Tom got it wrong, didn't he?
Tom doesn't want me to stay
Tom doesn't trust any of us
Tom doesn't seem to hear us
Tom doesn't seem to be busy
Tom doesn't see it that way
Tom doesn't look rich to me
Tom doesn't know who we are
Tom doesn't get this at all
Tom didn't take it with him
Tom didn't seem to think so
Tom didn't seem to be upset
Tom didn't see Mary do that
Tom didn't look too pleased
Tom didn't give me a choice
Tom didn't get on the plane
Tom didn't come to get Mary
Tom could've said something
Tom and Mary aren't talking
Tom and Mary aren't married
Tom and I'll stick together
Tom and I'll do it together
This is our fault, isn't it?
They're thirty dollars each
They're now in Tom's office
They'll be here soon enough
There'll have to be changes
The car's almost out of gas
That's your favorite, right?
That wasn't on the schedule
Shouldn't that be my choice?
See you in the morning, Tom
Pull yourself together, Tom
Maybe I've been misinformed
It's almost time to go home
It's a great day for a hike
It was your idea, wasn't it?
It looks like my job's done
I've never seen you so busy
I've never seen Tom so busy
I'm starting to feel better
I'm not very busy right now
I wonder why Tom isn't busy
I thought Tom wasn't hungry
I said it wasn't your fault
I knew that Tom wasn't busy
I don't often ask questions
How much does a ticket cost?
Haven't you had enough, Tom?
Have you been to the police?
Has Tom ever threatened you?
Hardly anybody's busy today
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Do you want some more bacon?
Do you know that for a fact?
Do you have my money or not?
Do you care what they think?
Did you get your money back?
Did Tom do well on the exam?
Are you sure we haven't met?
Are you claustrophobic, too?
Are we forgetting something?
You're supposed to be busy
You're so wrong about that
You're not hungry, are you?
You're not fooling anybody
You're needed at once, Tom
You're my best friend, Tom
You're jealous, aren't you?
You'd better ask Tom first
You were busy, weren't you?
You should've had some pie
You must've had a nice day
You didn't need to do that
You didn't have to do this
You didn't have to do that
Would you care for a taste?
Why is Tom in the hospital?
Why is this cabinet locked?
Why do you have Tom's keys?
Why do you have to do that?
Why did you say that to me?
Why are you wearing a suit?
Why are you being so noisy?
Why are you always so busy?
Whose umbrella did you use?
Who was driving the hearse?
Who isn't wearing lipstick?
Where have you been living?
Where have you been hiding?
Where are your parents now?
When did the meeting start?
What're you babbling about?
What're we doing here, Tom?
What were they doing there?
What was Tom doing in here?
What was their explanation?
What was it you were doing?
What have they done to Tom?
What does Tom have in mind?
What did they say happened?
What did they do yesterday?
What are you snickering at?
What are you investigating?
What are you in prison for?
Weren't you listening, Tom?
Were you wearing a name tag?
Were you flirting with Tom?
We've had a few casualties
We're the only people here
We're not from around here
We're in the same business
We're all on the same side
We'll start this afternoon
We'll meet Tom at the gate
We'll be there soon enough
We weren't all that hungry
We don't have lots of time
We don't have any kids yet
Tom's not having much luck
Tom's not from around here
Tom won't tell us anything
Tom won't be going with me
Tom won't ask you to dance
Tom was Mary's best friend
Tom thinks it's impossible
Tom says he's already paid
Tom lied to you, didn't he?
Tom laughed at Mary's idea
Tom knows what's happening
Tom isn't wearing a jacket
Tom isn't selling anything
Tom isn't paying attention
Tom isn't much of a talker
Tom isn't enjoying himself
Tom hasn't been here today
Tom hadn't considered that
Tom gazed into Mary's eyes
Tom doesn't need your help
Tom doesn't look very busy
Tom doesn't like any of us
Tom doesn't have insurance
Tom didn't want to go home
Tom didn't want to be late
Tom didn't say why he went
Tom didn't mean to be rude
Tom didn't know who it was
Tom didn't give Mary a lot
Tom couldn't understand us
Tom couldn't help grinning
Tom and Mary weren't there
Tom and Mary aren't hungry
Tom and Mary aren't afraid
Tom and I'll work together
Tom and I'll both be there
This isn't your fault, Tom
This isn't my fault, is it?
This is your bag, isn't it?
This is my life's ambition
They're out of their minds
There's snow on the ground
The bathroom's on the left
That wasn't easy, you know
That hasn't been confirmed
Thanks for the advice, Tom
Tell Tom Mary's on the way
Shouldn't you be listening?
Shouldn't you be in school?
Shouldn't we say something?
Remember your promise, Tom
My daughter's name is Mary
Maybe this isn't a problem
May I talk to you a minute?
Look at what Tom's wearing
Living with Tom isn't easy
It's nice to have you back
It's good to have you home
It's good to have you back
It's complicated, you know
It wasn't an easy decision
It was wonderful, you know
Isn't Tom having breakfast?
Is Mary wearing eye shadow?
I've always liked baseball
I'm originally from Boston
I know that Tom isn't busy
How have you been sleeping?
Here's my driver's license
Haven't you been listening?
Have you had breakfast yet?
Have you ever seen a ghost?
Has Tom said anything more?
Does Tom feel the same way?
Does anyone have an antidote?
Does it have to be tonight?
Do you think Tom is hungry?
Do you remember that night?
Do you really like it here?
Do you need our assistance?
Do you know where they are?
Do you know what they said?
Do you have to do this now?
Do you have to do that now?
Do you have an explanation?
Do you have a bowling ball?
Did you open all the boxes?
Did you find your car keys?
Did you do that on purpose?
Can we do it before Monday?
Can Tom drive himself home?
Aren't you having fun, Tom?
Are you wearing my glasses?
Are you two about finished?
Are you trying to be funny?
Are you having a breakdown?
Are you calling it a night?
Your skirt's on backwards
You're wearing my pajamas
You're on the wrong floor
You're not that important
You're not ready for this
You're not in danger here
You're in so much trouble
You're in serious trouble
You'll understand someday
You'll need to wear a tie
You'll need some of these
You'll need a screwdriver
You'd better not be drunk
You'd better listen to me
You must be Tom's parents
You must be Tom's brother
You aren't ready for this
Will you meet our demands?
Why weren't you listening?
Why is Tom wearing a coat?
Why is Tom being followed?
Why is that your nickname?
Why is it such a big deal?
Why has Tom been arrested?
Why does it have to be me?
Why do we have to do this?
Why did it have to be Tom?
Why aren't you interested?
Why aren't you in uniform?
Why aren't you in college?
Why are you wearing those?
Why are you wearing a tux?
Why are you so dressed up?
Why are you so busy today?
Why are you picking on me?
Who was that on the phone?
Where were you that night?
Where are you from anyway?
When did you realize that?
What've you done with Tom?
What've you done now, Tom?
What's your lawyer's name?
What's that on your shirt?
What's that in your mouth?
What're you doing tonight?
What're you doing in here?
What'll you have to drink?
What were you celebrating?
What were they doing here?
What were their interests?
What have you been eating?
What have they been doing?
What does Tom usually eat?
What does Tom have to say?
What do you think we need?
What do you do with these?
What did you say that for?
What did you have in mind?
What did you do with them?
What did you do with that?
What did you do in Boston?
What did Tom say happened?
What did Tom do this time?
What did they have to say?
What are they doing there?
What are these doing here?
What are their weaknesses?
Were you worried about me?
Well, what did you expect?
Well, Tom, you were right
We've had some good times
We're off to a good start
We're no longer in danger
We're late because of you
We're here because of you
We're having a lot of fun
We're almost out of sugar
We'll never agree to that
We'll meet you downstairs
We need that woman's name
We could meet you at 2:30
Tom's wife kicked him out
Tom's not so good at math
Tom's dog bit Mary's hand
Tom, do you have a moment?
Tom won't risk doing that
Tom won't make it in time
Tom won't let you do that
Tom won't let us help him
Tom won't even talk to me
Tom won't even look at me
Tom won't be needing that
Tom won't always be around
Tom wasn't too interested
Tom wasn't expecting that
Tom wasn't even surprised
Tom was working part-time
Tom was at Mary's baptism
Tom wants Mary's approval
Tom still hasn't shown up
Tom slashed Mary's throat
Tom should've been warned
Tom said he didn't get it
Tom pulled off Mary's wig
Tom knows what's going on
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy
Tom isn't saying anything
Tom is now in Mary's room
Tom has flu-like symptoms
Tom doesn't seem too busy
Tom doesn't look too busy
Tom doesn't have red hair
Tom didn't wear a uniform
Tom didn't talk to anyone
Tom didn't put up a fight
Tom didn't look that busy
Tom didn't give Mary much
Tom didn't get on the bus
Tom didn't get in the car
Tom could've had this job
Tom could've been injured
Tom chain-locked the door
Tom and Mary aren't happy
Tom and Mary aren't alone
Tom and I'll wait for you
Tom and I'll be all right
Tom acted in self-defense
This is Tom's handwriting
This is Tom, my colleague
This is Tom, my assistant
They'll be ready for that
There's no doubt about it
The gun hadn't been fired
That's your job, isn't it?
That's my impression, too
That wasn't my experience
Thanks for the help, guys
Thank you for coming, Tom
Tell Tom we're on our way
Shouldn't you be in there?
Should we call it a night?
Put on your seatbelt, Tom
Mary was Tom's first wife
Look, Tom, we have to move
Listen, we have a problem
Keep this to yourself, Tom
It's your money, isn't it?
It's time for us to leave
It's not time to stop yet
It was your grandfather's
Is it your birthday today?
I've never met Tom's wife
I've just finished dinner
I'm the only one here now
I'm sorry I said anything
I'm not at all hungry now
I'm glad to be of service
I'll help you in a minute
I wasn't very busy anyway
I thought you'd be hungry
I thought Tom wasn't busy
I know why Tom isn't here
I guess I'm not that busy
I don't think Tom is busy
How're you doing tonight?
How long's Tom been there?
How is Tom related to you?
How have you been feeling?
How did Tom and Mary meet?
How can you pick just one?
How are your grandparents?
Has Tom had many visitors?
Has that been done before?
Everything's in your room
Does Tom have to be there?
Does Tom have an attorney?
Does anybody have a match?
Do you need my assistance?
Do you know what Tom said?
Do you know what they did?
Do you know what that was?
Do you know that for sure?
Do you know how they knew?
Do you have Tom's picture?
Do you have Tom's address?
Do you have today's paper?
Do you have their address?
Do you have a moment, Tom?
Do you have a family, Tom?
Do you have a better plan?
Do you hate Tom that much?
Did you do the decorating?
Did you do that purposely?
Could you babysit my boys?
Could Tom have been there?
Come on, pick up the pace
Are you the only one here?
Are you doing this for me?
Are you doing that for me?
Are we done with this job?
Are they keeping you busy?
Your wife's on the phone
You're not wearing a tie
You're not that old, Tom
You're not that hopeless
You're not busy, are you?
You're no friend of mine
You're in the wrong seat
You're in serious danger
You'll never change, Tom
You'll need a flashlight
You'll meet Tom tomorrow
You'd better have a plan
You were right, you know
You must've been wrong
You must be Tom's sister
You must be Tom's father
You know that isn't true
You don't seem too happy
You don't seem so hungry
You don't look very busy
Wouldn't that be a shame?
Would you say that again?
Would you really do that?
Would you like more wine?
Would you do this for me?
Would that be acceptable?
Why was Tom at your home?
Why isn't Tom in the car?
Why is Tom picking on me?
Why have you deceived us?
Why do you have my phone?
Why aren't you in school?
Why aren't you in Boston?
Why aren't you here, Tom?
Why aren't these working?
Why are you wearing that?
Why are you a Republican?
Why are they saying that?
Who's picking up the tab?
Who's not wearing gloves?
Who's going to wear them?
Who did you have in mind?
Where's your family, Tom?
Where's Tom this morning?
Where were your children?
Where were you stationed?
Where were they standing?
Where is your compassion?
Where have you been, Tom?
Where are you going, Tom?
What've you done with it?
What've you been cooking?
What's your problem, Tom?
What's your niece's name?
What's your dilemma, Tom?
What's on your mind, Tom?
What're we doing tonight?
What're we doing in here?
What was in the envelope?
What was in that package?
What time did they leave?
What is it you want, Tom?
What is it you need, Tom?
What is it that you need?
What have you heard, Tom?
What have you found, Tom?
What have you discovered?
What does Tom do for fun?
What did you do with Tom?
What did you do in there?
What did Tom say this is?
What did Tom say exactly?
What did Tom have to say?
What did they say to you?
What did that accomplish?
What are you smirking at?
What are you negotiating?
What are you insinuating?
What are they rehearsing?
What are they doing here?
What are they discussing?
Were you in the military?
Were you and Tom friends?
We've never discussed it
We're the only ones left
We're ready for anything
We're not that desperate
We're not ready for this
We're in serious trouble
We're almost out of time
We're almost out of fuel
We're all beginners here
We're all agreed on that
We'll discuss this later
We weren't all that busy
We were close, Tom and I
Tom's wife picked him up
Tom's not ready for that
Tom's eyes are wide open
Tom was Mary's assistant
Tom was caught off-guard
Tom thinks it's possible
Tom says he's not hungry
Tom said I didn't get it
Tom must've overheard us
Tom must've had a reason
Tom must've been tired
Tom loved Mary, you know
Tom left just after 2:30
Tom knows we aren't busy
Tom isn't wearing gloves
Tom isn't that different
Tom isn't Mary's brother
Tom isn't going anywhere
Tom isn't doing anything
Tom hates Mary's cooking
Tom hasn't called me yet
Tom hasn't been arrested
Tom hadn't expected that
Tom followed Mary's lead
Tom drugged Mary's drink
Tom doesn't seem to care
Tom doesn't look so well
Tom didn't sign his will
Tom didn't see the point
Tom didn't go to college
Tom couldn't see anybody
Tom couldn't kill anyone
Tom couldn't be bothered
Tom could've been warned
Tom could've been killed
Tom and Mary aren't here
Tom and Mary aren't busy
Tom and I'll go together
This was in Tom's locker
This was in Tom's closet
This isn't your decision
This is your chance, Tom
They're very old friends
They're on the same team
They're not ready for us
They're friends of Tom's
That hasn't been decided
Tell Tom that he's wrong
Shouldn't you be at work?
My wallet's in my pocket
Mary is my ex-girlfriend
Listen to your wife, Tom
Let's pretend we're busy
Let them know we're busy
It's your responsibility
It's time to say goodbye
It's not time to eat yet
It wasn't Tom
It wasn't that expensive
It wasn't that difficult
It wasn't me
It hasn't been that long
Isn't that your car, Tom?
Isn't that a coincidence?
Is Tom telling the truth?
Is that Tom's MP3 player?
Is that Tom's girlfriend?
I'm wanted by the police
I'm waiting for a friend
I'm proud to be Canadian
I'm a pretty busy person
I'll never agree to that
I'll drive you to school
I'll be home all weekend
I know they're both busy
How're you doing at home?
How long's Tom been here?
How are you tonight, Tom?
How are you feeling, Tom?
Have you fully recovered?
Have you been practicing?
Have you been in a fight?
Have you been having fun?
Has Tom had any visitors?
Has Tom done this before?
Has Tom been transferred?
Give us a moment, please
Does Tom have to do this?
Does Tom have to do that?
Does Tom have to be here?
Does it have to be today?
Do you want some raisins?
Do you want some bourbon?
Do you think Tom is busy?
Do you remember that day?
Do you record your calls?
Do you know what Tom did?
Do you know what that is?
Do you know how Tom knew?
Do you know a better way?
Do you have Tom's number?
Do you have to do it now?
Do you have the painting?
Do you have a preference?
Do you have a point, Tom?
Do you have a better one?
Do you all feel that way?
Could you do that for me?
Could Tom have done this?
Come on, Tom, be patient
Can't you do that at all?
Are you worried about me?
Are you wearing my shoes?
Are you wearing lipstick?
Are you wearing a girdle?
Are you Tom's girlfriend?
Your hat's on backwards
You've become very cute
You're wearing my shoes
You're three hours late
You're nice to everyone
You'll remember me, Tom
You'll never believe it
You'll know soon enough
You'd better be kidding
You shouldn't talk here
You don't look too busy
You don't have to leave
Wow, isn't that amazing?
Wouldn't you agree, Tom?
Why were you frightened?
Why was Tom transferred?
Why isn't Tom at school?
Why is this room locked?
Why is that significant?
Why is that of interest?
Why is that interesting?
Why does Tom have to go?
Why does Tom have a gun?
Why do you wear a watch?
Why didn't you write me?
Why aren't you with Tom?
Why aren't you sleeping?
Why aren't you laughing?
Why aren't you in there?
Why aren't you in class?
Why aren't you at Tom's?
Why are you so cheerful?
Why are you crying, Tom?
Why are you all so busy?
Why are we meeting here?
Who'd want to wear that?
Who were you protecting?
Where were your parents?
Where were you that day?
Where were you standing?
Where was your daughter?
Where is Tom being held?
Where do you have to be?
Where did you find that?
Where are you stationed?
Where are you from, Tom?
Where are we going, Tom?
Where are my sunglasses?
What've you done to Tom?
What've you done lately?
What's your status, Tom?
What's your explanation?
What's your excuse, Tom?
What's your answer, Tom?
What's Tom's dog's name?
What's in the briefcase?
What're you saying, Tom?
What're you doing there?
What're you doing later?
What were you expecting?
What were they thinking?
What was Tom's response?
What was Tom describing?
What time's your flight?
What time did Tom leave?
What should we do first?
What is it you do again?
What have you done here?
What have you concluded?
What do you have to say?
What do you eat, anyway?
What do you do, exactly?
What did you have to do?
What did you do with it?
What are your ambitions?
What are you gawking at?
What are these pictures?
What a beautiful design!
Weren't you freaked out?
Were you in an accident?
Were you at the concert?
Well, aren't you coming?
We've said our goodbyes
We've had very bad luck
We're the only two left
We're meeting for lunch
We're five minutes away
We're almost out of gas
We'd better have a talk
We aren't very busy yet
Was Tom wearing cologne?
Was Tom in the accident?
Was that Tom's computer?
Was Mary wearing a cape?
Tom's not ready to quit
Tom's house was on fire
Tom wouldn't believe me
Tom would've understood
Tom won't open the door
Tom won't listen to you
Tom won't have a chance
Tom won't be successful
Tom won't be happy here
Tom wasn't the youngest
Tom wasn't expecting it
Tom wasn't at the party
Tom was our friend, too
Tom was crazy, you know
Tom still isn't so busy
Tom still hasn't shaved
Tom still hasn't called
Tom says it's important
Tom says he's very rich
Tom says he wasn't here
Tom knows what's coming
Tom knows it's hopeless
Tom just couldn't do it
Tom isn't strong enough
Tom isn't seeing anyone
Tom isn't Mary's father
Tom isn't in Boston now
Tom isn't hungry either
Tom isn't far behind us
Tom isn't easily amused
Tom isn't a nice person
Tom is twice Mary's age
Tom hadn't noticed Mary
Tom felt Mary's forehead
Tom ducked Mary's punch
Tom doesn't fit in here
Tom didn't want to talk
Tom didn't want me here
Tom didn't tell anybody
Tom didn't shoot anyone
Tom didn't look pleased
Tom didn't help anybody
Tom didn't go after all
Tom couldn't protect me
Tom could've killed you
Tom could've been lying
Tom called Mary's bluff
This wasn't Tom's fault
This was your idea, Tom
This isn't for you, Tom
This is Tom's handiwork
They're friends of mine
These are Tom's glasses
These are Tom's friends
The guns weren't loaded
The doctor's on his way
That's a beautiful song
That wasn't on the list
That wasn't my question
Thanks for the tip, Tom
Thanks for calling, Tom
Thank you for this, Tom
Speak for yourself, Tom
Please have a seat, Tom
Place your bets, please
Nothing's wrong with me
Nobody's as fast as you
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry
Lunch wasn't that great
It's time to wrap it up
It's time to go to work
It's time for you to go
It's my fault, you know
It's in your hands, Tom
It was Tom's, wasn't it?

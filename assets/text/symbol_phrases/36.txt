I hear you're helping her
They're binding up the meat
Will they baptise Mary soon?
Bit of a whizzkid, ain't he?
You'll ruin the carpet!
Let's spin round, in circles!
He's know to gripe
It's good to do it yourself
Please don't gape at me
It's rather rude, y'know.
That's a bit skany, is it not?
Please don't string me along.
Hey, come check this out!
I got a freebie.
Oh, no!
It's a time-honoured tradition
Well, that's effing stupid.
I can't take it anymore!
Scurry on home little one.

Oh, nothing too fancy.
This doesn't matter at all
Try hitting the "shift" key
Don't frazzle me!
I love my Dutch oven!
Stay focused.
He's a bit woo-woo
I don't know
He's feeling rather fiendish
This is the jumping-off point
We've been outflanked!
They have an A-frame house
It's gruelling work
Pipe up, please!
He has a well-kept garden
Don't pummel your brother
What a measly offering!
It was an action-packed film!
Don't jostle the baby
I'm not into pageantry
I love this go-cart!
He is the current title-holder
He's a Whig
Gear up and let's go!
She's the party's figurehead
It's time for a spring clean!
He's plodding along
Can you customise it?
It's in the pluperfect tense
How clumsy of me!
I'm open to all possibilities
No, I don't see anything
I couldn't hold back the tears
I hadn't cried for ages
Are planets solid bodies?
You think this'll work?
I didn't care about the money
How'd you get that?
There's nothing in it for me
Has anyone ever told you that?
Because I don't want to
So what's your excuse?
C'mon, it's not that bad
Is it made of copper?
I don't need help from anyone
How often do you masturbate?
Do I need to?
I'm shaking from the cold
You're stalling!
Tom went for a single-leg
It didn't end well between us
Oh my God, I saw that
Can you help me learn Rust?
He couldn't go anywhere else
She's in my class
Well, what's wrong?
Is Mr Miller back yet?
No, I'm afraid he's not.
He's not home yet
No, thanks.
Wait until he's back
I'm sure everyone's hungry
I'm eager for this to be over
Who does he love?

How much of it do you need?
How much do you need of it?
What's your role in this?
I've got lots of those
The driver wasn't injured
The driver wasn't hurt
What have they been up to now?
Where can they be?
Have you already eaten today?
Where are you now exactly?
Have you eaten today?
Saying it isn't enough
They're acting very strangely
It's one and the same thing
It's one and the same
She's gone to buy some wine
He's a long-standing friend
Fifty-fifty?
He's an OK guy
It's not my first choice
It wouldn't be my first choice
She's in a pickle
She's in dire straits
She's in bad shape
She's in a bad way
Raise the roof!
She's a natural exaggerator
Ask her to come, dummy
Make a decision!
It's a tough sell
It's a hard sell
It's real to me
There's a double rainbow!
I don't care if I get arrested
Are we the baddies?
Your tricks don't work on me
What is the conclusion?
When did you last date a man?
Should we refuse?
What plan do you have?
How will you proceed?
Can you give me a light?
We'll never be good friends
It's a matter of respect
He won't need it any longer
I'm clean-cut
Does this sound better?
See?
That wasn't so bad
Don't make mistakes
Don't be mistaken
Don't err
Don't be wrong
How did they get together?
How did they meet?
Submit!
I'm at a crossroads
I'm at a critical stage
We're trained for this
It's a race against himself
Which pet do you like?
He's blind to his own flaws
He doesn't see his own faults
You're an incurable romantic
You're a hopeless idealist
You're not that handsome
Who wants to try too?
Did you guys hide something?
Can you pick me up from work?
Has anything happened?
I'd hate to be you
Do you understand?
I don't like to drive at night
She didn't look at him
What did the analysis show?
I'm thankful for my parents
I'm grateful for my family
Look!
Mushrooms!
Abolish borders!
I'm glad I have a job
What is the definition?
I'm glad Tom stopped dipping
He's dead, Tom
She's a crack addict
He's always silent
He's usually quiet
Rather, it is life who did
It's very suggestive
What the fuck do you want?
This one is me, in anger
Is the anaesthetist there?
What do you think to the cake?
It's not quite my thing.
It's not suitable for drinking
With great pleasure, my friend
He'd gone home to see his mum
Are fairy tales just stories?
I'm sorry, I can't stay

Apparently, Mark was wrong
Jessica minimized Mark's abuse
Mark can't take any more abuse

Was it worth the risk?
Let's walk faster
Is there time for that?
It's the only thing to do
What more do we need to do?
Which of you will be going?

Do people actually live here?
You'd better not mess this up
That wasn't our first choice
What do you normally do?

She's not worried any more
She's no longer worried
You shouldn't shout at him
I don't want to be forgotten
She can't right now
It's a very bold step

That doesn't make sense!
Why are you giving me money?
It's not normal
She's progressing
Tom won't stop meowing at me

Tom?
That's hard to imagine.
Well, he is
Do you know Tom?
We met once.
Have I come at a bad time?
What is a club in any case?
Any news?

We're going left
You're breaking the rules
Nobody mentioned you!
I must've taken a wrong turn
Were you at home?
No, we weren't
Less talk; more action!
Why can we not divide by zero?
That's my favourite chair
Who's that strange bloke?
There's no way back

What is social justice?
Tom, you're manspreading
I'm a princess
It's a small room, isn't it?
Want another beer?
Are you sure it's not a fire?
It's a sentence about nothing!

I really like you, too
Matthew's lips were so soft
It isn't my problem
What will be easier for Tom?
The Masons?
No, why do you ask?
Is it true that he banged her?
She's at the market
I don't have a driving licence
Where did I put my magic wand?
What?
Do you reckon?
I'll bring the suitcases in
It's freezing cold at home
I just can't explain it
I'll now explain everything
I think I'll get going.
What do you mean?
I'm not in the mood for Peter
Were you at Mary's wedding?
Yeah, as an onlooker.
Let's plant some trees
What an honour!
Your wing mirrors are filthy!
You must be exhausted, my dear
No, they looked quite fresh.
We haven't set off yet
We haven't taken off yet
Sunday lunch on a Monday?
How unusual!
It's unlikely.
Break's over!
Back to work!
Mind if I come?
Oh, it's so cold in here!
I'm bored

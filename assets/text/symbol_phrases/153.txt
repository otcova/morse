I wasn't expecting anything
I was pretty good, wasn't I?
I was going over Tom's file
I was afraid you'd say that
I was afraid you'd ask that
I took Tom's blood pressure
I told you Tom didn't do it
I told you I couldn't do it
I told you I can't help you
I told Tom we'd be late
I told Tom I couldn't do it
I thought you wouldn't mind
I thought we'd surprise you
I said all I'm going to say
I hope Tom doesn't get sick
I don't want Tom to do that
I don't know if I can do it
I don't have anything to do
Don't you have any ambition?
Do you know what this means?
Aren't you curious about it?
Your car's totally wrecked
You've told me that before
You've saved all our lives
You've said nothing so far
You've quit smoking, right?
You've hurt Tom's feelings
You've got to come out now
You're with me, aren't you?
You're up late, aren't you?
You're too weak to do that
You're thirty minutes late
You're not scared, are you?
You're not joking, are you?
You're good at what you do
You're always welcome here
You're a very good teacher
You're a great-looking guy
You'll have to be the boss
You'll be there in no time
You'd regret that, I think
You won't get away with it
You won't find it in there
You won't be safe anywhere
You picked Tom, didn't you?
You have a good heart, Tom
You don't know anyone here
Would you stop saying that?
Would you please step back?
Would you please excuse us?
Would you please come here?
Would you help me out here?
Why should I buy a new car?
Why are you wearing gloves?
Why are you angry with Tom?
Whatever you do, don't cry
What's your husband's name?
What're you thinking about?
We're waiting to be served
We're running out of money
We're not throwing it away
We're asking the questions
We're about to have guests
We're about to have dinner
We'll be there in a minute
We'll all be together soon
We wouldn't stand a chance
We won't know until we try
We won't do it without you
We won't be able to escape
We don't have a dishwasher
Tom's bag is near the door
Tom's a very good engineer
Tom, your life's in danger
Tom, you've got to wake up
Tom, you've got to help me
Tom wouldn't run out on us
Tom wouldn't do that to me
Tom wouldn't bother to lie
Tom would've thrown us out
Tom works for a non-profit
Tom won't care what we say
Tom won't be afraid of you
Tom will be fine, won't he?
Tom wasn't sure what to do
Tom set his alarm for 2:30
Tom says he's really sorry
Tom noticed Mary's mistake
Tom is in his mid-thirties
Tom has a four-year degree
Tom doesn't live in Boston
Tom couldn't open the door
Tom couldn't find his keys
This is a collector's item
They're brother and sister
They won't risk doing that
They won't let you in, Tom
They won't even talk to me
The closet door won't open
That's fantastic, isn't it?
Tell Tom when you're ready
It's interesting, isn't it?
If Tom dies, what'll we do?
I've tried everything else
I've told Tom where we are
I've been looking for this
I'm worried about Tom, too
I'm well aware of the risk
I'm waiting to talk to Tom
I'm very good with numbers
I'm very good at what I do
I'm using it at the moment
I'm unwilling to risk that
I'm turning it over to you
I'm trying to cheer you up
I'm touched you remembered
I'm tired of listening to you
I'm thinking of firing you
I'm thinking about leaving
I'm the one with the money
I'm the one who caught Tom
I'm the one who built this
I'm telling you what I saw
I'm telling you Tom did it
I'm telling you to shut up
I'm telling the truth, Tom
I'm taking you out of here
I'm taking Tom to the park
I'm sure you'll understand
I'm sure you'll find a way
I'm sure you'll be welcome
I'm sure you misunderstood
I'm sure you did your best
I'm sure you can handle it
I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind
I'm sure Tom would love it
I'm sure Tom will help you
I'm sure Tom told you that
I'm sure Tom is on his way
I'm sure Tom could help us
I'm sure I wasn't followed
I'm sure I locked the door
I'm sure I heard something
I'm sure going to miss Tom
I'm sure everything's fine
I'm suddenly rather hungry
I'm still angry about that
I'm staying at Tom's house
I'm starting to get hungry
I'm standing up for myself
I'm sorry, I can't do this
I'm sorry, I can't do that
I'm sorry I missed the fun
I'm sorry I lost my temper
I'm sorry I had to do that
I'm sorry I frightened you
I'm sorry for interrupting
I'm sorry about everything
I'm sorry about being late
I'm so glad you're staying
I'm so glad you could come
I'm sitting here in my car
I'm running for reelection
I'm really mad at you guys
I'm really glad you called
I'm really glad to see you
I'm really glad to hear it
I'm ready whenever you are
I'm only three blocks away
I'm on my way to a meeting
I'm off to help my friends
I'm occupied at the moment
I'm not used to Boston yet
I'm not trying to be funny
I'm not that desperate yet
I'm not talking about that
I'm not taking any chances
I'm not sure what you mean
I'm not sure what it means
I'm not sure what happened
I'm not sure I believe you
I'm not staying in a hotel
I'm not so sure it was Tom
I'm not so sure about this
I'm not so sure about that
I'm not really in the mood
I'm not much of a mechanic
I'm not leaving Tom behind
I'm not keeping this thing
I'm not interested in that
I'm not going to sign this
I'm not going to shoot you
I'm not going to open this
I'm not going to need that
I'm not going to live here
I'm not going to leave you
I'm not going to judge you
I'm not going to fight you
I'm not going to blame you
I'm not going to ask again
I'm not doing this for you
I'm not doing this anymore
I'm not certain what to do
I'm not being unreasonable
I'm not allowed to do that
I'm not afraid of you, Tom
I'm not a bachelor anymore
I'm meeting Tom in an hour
I'm meeting Tom for dinner
I'm looking for my glasses
I'm living with my parents
I'm leaving that up to you
I'm leaving in the morning
I'm just worried about you
I'm just trying to be kind
I'm just thinking out loud
I'm just stating the facts
I'm just going to sit here
I'm just glad I could help
I'm just calling to say hi
I'm just a phone call away
I'm just a little confused
I'm investigating a murder
I'm in enough pain already
I'm hoping you can help me
I'm here to talk about Tom
I'm having second thoughts
I'm handling the situation
I'm going to work with Tom
I'm going to win this time
I'm going to try something
I'm going to throw Tom out
I'm going to throw a party
I'm going to tell Tom that
I'm going to take Tom home
I'm going to stay with Tom
I'm going to stay in today
I'm going to set the table
I'm going to see you later
I'm going to see Tom again
I'm going to open the wine
I'm going to need a minute
I'm going to miss you, Tom
I'm going to miss you guys
I'm going to lock the door
I'm going to join the army
I'm going to go inside now
I'm going to do that again
I'm going to do it for you
I'm going to deal with Tom
I'm going to call you back
I'm going to call it a day
I'm going to call for help
I'm going to be right here
I'm going jogging tomorrow
I'm going back to work now
I'm going as fast as I can
I'm glad you're still here
I'm glad you feel that way
I'm glad you could make it
I'm glad you agree with me
I'm glad we got here early
I'm glad it all worked out
I'm getting a little drunk
I'm feeling better already
I'm feeling a little woozy
I'm feeling a little tense
I'm fairly sure it'll work
I'm excited about tomorrow
I'm doing this to help Tom
I'm doing a lot of reading
I'm delighted to hear that
I'm certain it can be done
I'm calling from my mobile
I'm better off without you
I'm being paid to help you
I'm aware of your problems
I'm aware of the situation
I'm asking you to trust me
I'm anxious to get started
I'm afraid you're too late
I'm afraid Tom will say no
I'm afraid I have bad news
I'm about to take Tom home
I'm a pretty good handyman
I'm a different person now
I'm a big fan of your work
I'll write it down for you
I'll turn thirty next week
I'll try to control myself
I'll tell you when to stop
I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll tell you what I think
I'll tell you if I find it
I'll tell Tom you're ready
I'll tell Tom where I went
I'll teach you many things
I'll take Tom there myself
I'll take good care of Tom
I'll take care of your dog
I'll take care of it later
I'll stay right where I am
I'll show you to your room
I'll settle with you later
I'll send you the schedule
I'll send a message to Tom
I'll see you later tonight
I'll see you later at home
I'll see you in a few days
I'll see you all next week
I'll see to it immediately
I'll return in ten minutes
I'll open the door for you
I'll never trust you again
I'll never trust Tom again
I'll never leave you again
I'll never forget you, Tom
I'll never forget that day
I'll meet you Monday night
I'll meet you in the lobby
I'll meet you at my office
I'll meet with Tom tonight
I'll make you a cup of tea
I'll make the arrangements
I'll look after our guests
I'll let you know tomorrow
I'll know better next time
I'll kill Tom if I have to
I'll just have some coffee
I'll help you wash the car
I'll help you look for Tom
I'll help when I come back
I'll have to think it over
I'll have to remember that
I'll have to be innovative
I'll guard it with my life
I'll give you five minutes
I'll give you a good price
I'll give you a call later
I'll get us some more wine
I'll get right back to you
I'll get in touch with you
I'll get in touch with Tom
I'll get a room at a motel
I'll fire Tom if I have to
I'll finish what I started
I'll explain what happened
I'll examine it for myself
I'll do whatever I have to
I'll do what I can to help
I'll decide how to proceed
I'll check in on you later
I'll certainly talk to Tom
I'll catch the next flight
I'll catch a ride with Tom
I'll call for an ambulance
I'll be taking Tom's place
I'll be staying in a motel
I'll be back when I'm done
I'll be back for you later
I'll be back for Tom later
I'll be able to assist you
I'll be a few more minutes
I'll ask you one last time
I'll always care about you
I'll always believe in you
I'd trust Tom with my life
I'd think you'd understand
I'd think that was obvious
I'd say that's a good idea
I'd recognize you anywhere
I'd recognize Tom anywhere
I'd rather not discuss Tom
I'd love some help on this
I'd like to speak with you
I'd like to buy you dinner
I'd like some help, please
I'd know if you were lying
I'd better think this over
I'd better tell the others
I'd better get back inside
I'd better do it right now
I'd better be getting home
I'd be quiet if I were you
I wouldn't worry about Tom
I wouldn't put it past Tom
I wouldn't know what to do
I wouldn't get my hopes up
I would've had a good time
I won't let it go to waste
I won't be ready for weeks
I won't be home for a week
I won't be here next month
I won't be coming with you
I won't be a party to this
I wish I didn't have to go
I went over to Tom's house
I wasn't thinking straight
I wasn't talking about you
I wasn't talking about Tom
I wasn't stealing anything
I wasn't home at that time
I wasn't here a moment ago
I wasn't going to hurt you
I was hoping you'd tell me
I was hoping you'd do that
I want to go back to Tom's
I usually don't wear a tie
I usually don't wear a hat
I told you we'd meet again
I told you I'd protect you
I told you I can't make it
I thought you'd be excited
I thought it'd take months
I thought it'd be too much
I hope Tom doesn't show up
I don't want to drink that
I don't know much about it
I don't know if I can help
I don't have a car anymore
I assume you're in a hurry
Have you seen Tom on stage?
Do you know where Tom went?
Do you know the difference?
Did you say something, Tom?
Beautiful woman, isn't she?
Are you going to go or not?
Are you asking me for help?
Your name's Tom, isn't it?
You've walked into a trap
You've underestimated Tom
You've still got your job
You've seen what I can do
You've really earned this
You've piqued my interest
You've made a bad mistake
You've got to concentrate
You've disgraced yourself
You've been through a lot
You've been a great guest
You're not upset, are you?
You're not tired, are you?
You're not going, are you?
You're not a teenager yet
You're asking for trouble
You're a good-looking guy
You're a good friend, Tom
You're a fantastic kisser
You would've loved Boston
You have a job, don't you?
You have a car, don't you?
You don't love me, do you?
Would you mind if we left?
Why don't you take a walk?
Why don't you read a book?
Why doesn't Tom like Mary?
Why do I have to help Tom?
Why are you late to class?
What's your mother's name?
What's your father's name?
What's Mary's maiden name?
What are the alternatives?
We're sorry for your loss
We're conducting a survey
We'll be here for a while
We weren't doing anything
We haven't officially met
We don't need Tom anymore
Tom's not with us anymore
Tom's not very good at it
Tom's not in the hospital
Tom's not happy with that
Tom, you've grown so fast
Tom, you've got to get up
Tom wouldn't listen to me
Tom wouldn't have said no
Tom wouldn't abandon Mary
Tom won't let me help him
Tom won't know what to do
Tom wasn't gone very long
Tom pointed to Mary's car
Tom knows we aren't happy
Tom is your son, not mine
Tom is a stay-at-home dad
Tom gave Mary a thumbs-up
Tom doesn't have cable TV
Tom doesn't have an alibi
Tom didn't have much time
Tom didn't deserve to die
Tom became self-conscious
They're not all criminals
They're a bunch of losers
They won't let me see Tom
They don't have any money
That wasn't a coincidence
That was a lie, wasn't it?
Tell Tom I won't be there
Mary is Tom's half-sister
It's time to feed the dog
It's good to be back home
It isn't necessary, is it?
It doesn't get any easier
Is it a trap of some kind?
I'm writing another story
I'm waiting for an answer
I'm usually not this busy
I'm used to being ignored
I'm trying to protect you
I'm trying to protect Tom
I'm too old to start over
I'm Tom and I'm an addict
I'm the one with the bomb
I'm the one who loves you
I'm telling the truth now
I'm taking Tom for a walk
I'm taking my lunch break
I'm taking a semester off
I'm sure Tom will turn up
I'm sure Tom will love it
I'm sure Tom will do well
I'm sure Tom will be late
I'm sure Tom will be fine
I'm sure Tom is mad at me
I'm sure Tom is just fine
I'm sure they can hear us
I'm sure that Tom is busy
I'm sure it's Tom's fault
I'm sure glad that's over
I'm suddenly very thirsty
I'm still working on this
I'm still working on that
I'm still married to Mary
I'm still looking for Tom
I'm still kind of thirsty
I'm staying at the Hilton
I'm sorry, I've got to go
I'm sorry Tom wasn't here
I'm sorry it took so long
I'm sorry if I misled you
I'm sorry I brought it up
I'm sorry for the trouble
I'm sorry about your loss
I'm sorry about the noise
I'm sorry about that, Tom
I'm so glad you showed up
I'm so glad you said that
I'm sitting here with Tom
I'm simply planning ahead
I'm simply obeying orders
I'm seeing a pattern here
I'm running out of energy
I'm running a little late
I'm real upset about that
I'm pretty sure it's true
I'm paying for everything
I'm out of town next week
I'm only here to help Tom
I'm only here for one day
I'm only following orders
I'm one of the lucky ones
I'm offering you a choice
I'm not worried about you
I'm not very good at this
I'm not thirsty right now
I'm not telling you again
I'm not talking about Tom
I'm not sure you're ready
I'm not sure Tom is ready
I'm not sure I understand
I'm not sure how to begin
I'm not supposed to drink
I'm not so sure about Tom
I'm not satisfied with it
I'm not prepared for this
I'm not planning anything
I'm not on duty this week
I'm not much of an artist
I'm not like that anymore
I'm not like other people
I'm not learning anything
I'm not in love with Mary
I'm not having a good day
I'm not going without you
I'm not going to tell you
I'm not going to show you
I'm not going to say that
I'm not going to move out
I'm not going to kiss you
I'm not going to fire you
I'm not going to eat this
I'm not going to eat that
I'm not exactly surprised
I'm not doing this for me
I'm not convinced of that
I'm not being paid enough
I'm not asking you to lie
I'm not a teacher anymore
I'm not a soldier anymore
I'm no different than you
I'm never going to Boston
I'm never getting married
I'm meeting someone later
I'm looking for adventure
I'm looking for a new job
I'm just pulling your leg
I'm just having a bad day
I'm just glad Tom is back
I'm just following orders
I'm just a little nervous
I'm just a little curious
I'm in charge of shopping
I'm in charge of security
I'm horrible with animals
I'm here to take you home
I'm here to take Tom home
I'm here to help you, Tom
I'm here to do what I can
I'm here at Tom's request
I'm having problems again
I'm having a heart attack
I'm growing a beard again
I'm going to work on that
I'm going to wait outside
I'm going to wait for Tom
I'm going to Tom's office
I'm going to the restroom
I'm going to the hospital
I'm going to the bathroom
I'm going to tell you now
I'm going to talk to them
I'm going to take off now
I'm going to surprise Tom
I'm going to speak to Tom
I'm going to quit smoking
I'm going to park the car
I'm going to need the key
I'm going to need details
I'm going to name him Tom
I'm going to help you now
I'm going to go to Boston
I'm going to go join them
I'm going to get you, Tom
I'm going to get you home
I'm going to get some tea
I'm going to get some air
I'm going to drive myself
I'm going to cook for you
I'm going to check on Tom
I'm going to build a fire
I'm going to be over here
I'm going to be out today
I'm going to be gone soon
I'm going to be all right
I'm going to be a teacher
I'm going to ask Mary out
I'm going out for a drink
I'm going back to college
I'm glad you're my friend
I'm glad you're here, Tom
I'm glad you're all right
I'm glad you weren't here
I'm glad you realize that
I'm glad to see you're OK
I'm glad that you're here
I'm glad I could help out
I'm getting tired of this
I'm flying back to Boston
I'm done with all of that
I'm done listening to you
I'm delighted to meet you
I'm cutting my trip short
I'm considering resigning
I'm calling Tom right now
I'm bringing home a pizza
I'm being honest with you
I'm at the end of my rope
I'm asking what you think
I'm as shocked as you are
I'm as curious as you are
I'm afraid Tom isn't here
I'm afraid I may hurt Tom
I'm a pretty good swimmer
I'm a pretty good student
I'm a little disappointed
I'll walk you to the gate
I'll try to remember that
I'll try to keep it short
I'll try to distract them
I'll text you the address
I'll tell you what to say
I'll tell you what I know
I'll tell Tom you're here
I'll tell Tom you said so
I'll tell Tom you came by
I'll talk to you tomorrow
I'll talk to Tom about it
I'll take care of you all
I'll take care of the cat
I'll take care of it, Tom
I'll stay out of your way
I'll stay a few more days
I'll show you where it is
I'll show you the way out
I'll see you at the party
I'll see what is possible
I'll see to it right away
I'll say it one more time
I'll never understand you
I'll never leave you, Tom
I'll never be that famous
I'll need you to be there
I'll make you some coffee
I'll make you proud of me
I'll make a pot of coffee
I'll let you speak to Tom
I'll leave that up to you
I'll kill the both of you
I'll just get you started
I'll join you there later
I'll join you in a moment
I'll introduce you to Tom
I'll hit Tom if I have to
I'll have to do it myself
I'll hang onto it for now
I'll go with Tom and Mary
I'll go take a shower now
I'll go anywhere you want
I'll go and get your coat
I'll give you a lift home
I'll give Tom the message
I'll give it my best shot
I'll fix you a cup of tea
I'll find out soon enough
I'll find my own way back
I'll explain it all later
I'll do whatever you want
I'll do whatever it takes
I'll do what must be done
I'll do it in the morning
I'll do anything you wish
I'll deal with Tom myself
I'll check with you later
I'll catch the next train
I'll catch the next plane
I'll call you after lunch
I'll borrow us some tools
I'll be with you in a sec
I'll be with Tom and Mary
I'll be waiting out front
I'll be there in a second
I'll be ready in a second
I'll be in the other room
I'll be back in my office
I'll be at the front door
I'll be as quick as I can
I'll be along in a minute
I'll arrange that for you
I'll answer that question
I'd take it if I were you
I'd really like to go now
I'd rather stay anonymous
I'd rather not go into it
I'd rather die than leave
I'd never let that happen
I'd make a good chaperone
I'd like for you to leave
I'd better go talk to Tom
I'd better call Tom first
I'd better call Tom again
I'd be willing to pay you
I wouldn't worry about it
I wouldn't try that again
I wouldn't recommend that
I wouldn't change a thing
I would've sent Tom money
I wonder what Tom's doing
I wonder if you'd help us
I won't obey those orders
I won't let you ruin this
I won't leave without Tom
I wish you'd called first
I wish you hadn't told me
I wish Tom were here, too
I wish I weren't Canadian
I wish I had Tom's brains
I went to Tom's apartment
I wasn't really listening
I wasn't paying attention
I wasn't informed of this
I wasn't going to give up
I wasn't cooking anything
I was gone for 45 minutes
I underestimated you, Tom
I told you you'd like Tom
I told you I'm not hungry
I told Tom it wasn't mine
I thought you'd never ask
I thought they'd heard us
I thought I'd be too late
I shouldn't have slept in
I hope this isn't a dream
I don't want to live here
I didn't prepare a speech
Don't you have an opinion?
Do you like the food here?
Do you know what to bring?
Do you have any sunscreen?
Do you have a few minutes?
Could you show me the way?
Could I borrow your ruler?
Beautiful night, isn't it?
Are you worried about Tom?
Are you going to tell Tom?
Are you feeling all right?
Are you asking my opinion?
Are you a friend of Tom's?
Are there any more donuts?
Am I making you nervous?
You've slept a long time
You've helped us so much
You've got to believe me
You've got the advantage
You've come just in time
You've been holding back
You've already got a job
You're worrying too much
You're very good at this
You're tired, aren't you?
You're taking a big risk
You're not my girlfriend
You're not lost, are you?
You're not hurt, are you?
You're not a kid anymore
You're joking, of course
You're breaking my heart
You're a horrible person
You're a grown woman now
You'll be very impressed
You won't be on your own
You have my support, Tom
You have my respect, Tom
You are lost, aren't you?
Would you pass the salad?
Would you come over here?
Why don't you take a nap?
Why don't people like me?
What are the differences?
We've wasted enough time
We're very happy for you
We're on the wrong train
We're late for the dance
We're having a good time
We're friends, aren't we?
We're brother and sister
We're all Canadians here
We'll work on that first
We'll be late for dinner
We have a two-car garage
Tom's out of the picture
Tom's out of the country
Tom's not missing, is he?
Tom's not in a good mood
Tom's having a good time
Tom's coat kept him warm
Tom's a fine-looking boy
Tom wouldn't let them in
Tom wouldn't let me help
Tom wouldn't hurt anyone
Tom would've left a note
Tom will be OK, won't he?
Tom said that he's sorry
Tom isn't messing around
Tom isn't a good swimmer
Tom is Mary's only child
Tom hasn't come home yet
Tom has no chance, right?
Tom didn't like the plan
Tom didn't like homework
Tom didn't keep his word
Tom didn't have to study
Tom co-wrote these songs
Tom checked Mary's pulse
This isn't a negotiation
This isn't a coincidence
They're not my prisoners
They're not always right
They're having a meeting
They won't find you here
That's unusual, isn't it?
That wasn't the question
It's the truth, isn't it?
It's really cold outside
It's difficult, isn't it?
I'm working with Tom now
I'm working on my speech
I'm working on a project
I'm willing to risk that
I'm very sorry about Tom
I'm very good at sailing
I'm unwilling to do that
I'm unaccustomed to this
I'm trying to stay awake
I'm trying to keep awake
I'm trying to get to Tom
I'm trying to compensate
I'm too excited to sleep
I'm Tom's legal guardian
I'm Tom and this is Mary
I'm thrilled to meet you
I'm the one with the car
I'm telling you to leave
I'm taking you to school
I'm taking Tom some food
I'm taking Tom his lunch
I'm surprised you called
I'm sure you'll like Tom
I'm sure you'll do great
I'm sure you can't do it
I'm sure Tom misses Mary
I'm sure that's not true
I'm sure glad to see you
I'm sure everything's OK
I'm supposed to meet Tom
I'm stuck here in Boston
I'm still married to Tom
I'm still kind of hungry
I'm still here, aren't I?
I'm staying with friends
I'm starting to like you
I'm sorry, but it's time
I'm sorry you can't stay
I'm sorry to disturb you
I'm sorry I mentioned it
I'm sorry I let you down
I'm sorry I bothered you
I'm sorry for everything
I'm sorry about all this
I'm so proud of you, Tom
I'm so glad you liked it
I'm so glad I could help
I'm right over here, Tom
I'm right here, aren't I?
I'm responsible for this
I'm really proud of this
I'm really not very well
I'm pretty sure about it
I'm pleased to hear that
I'm parked around the corner
I'm only staying an hour
I'm one of your students
I'm one of Tom's friends
I'm one of the good guys
I'm not worried about it
I'm not very eager to go
I'm not thirty years old
I'm not thinking clearly
I'm not that kind of guy
I'm not sure that's true
I'm not sure of anything
I'm not sure I trust Tom
I'm not sure I can do it
I'm not signing anything
I'm not selling anything
I'm not ready to give up
I'm not ready to die yet
I'm not ready for it yet
I'm not playing with you
I'm not much of a dancer
I'm not messing with you
I'm not making any plans
I'm not like most people
I'm not leaving with you
I'm not leaving with Tom
I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with Tom
I'm not here to hurt you
I'm not here to help you
I'm not here on business
I'm not going to do this
I'm not going to do that
I'm not giving up on Tom
I'm not getting involved
I'm not gambling anymore
I'm not from around here
I'm not feeling too well
I'm not expecting anyone
I'm not eating this fish
I'm not driving anywhere
I'm not done with it yet
I'm not doing it anymore
I'm not cut out for this
I'm not coming back home
I'm not cleaning that up
I'm not at all surprised
I'm not allowed to leave
I'm not afraid of snakes
I'm not afraid of ghosts
I'm not afraid of flying
I'm not afraid of anyone
I'm not a violent person

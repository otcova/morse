Is this letter yours?
They're not in China
I'm not in China
Have you received that letter?
We're out of catnip
In my eyes, rats are cute
The lift doesn't work
Do you like pizza or pasta?
We've got to talk to Tom
It didn't rain today
I don't believe in Quran
Tom's a stone-cold murderer
Which book do you like more?
My plane leaves at 2 p.m
You're holding it upside down
It's been nine hours
Why didn't she call me first?
I'm going to Constantinople
It's about politics
Was that meant in jest?
I already know.
As ever, Tom has an answer
We leave on 20 August at 6 a.m
He didn't have a penny
How much mince did you buy?
How many of them do you want?
I've been to London
Are you at Nan's?
Are you at Granny's?
What are you doing today?
Nothing.
That's what you did yesterday.
Well, I haven't finished yet.
I don't like queuing up
Does he drink tea?
I've missed you terribly
It's her birthday today
Give me a pen.
Will this ballpoint do?
Honestly, the way he behaved!
All right!
Keep your hair on!
Could that be?
The meaning doesn't change
Take care!
See you at school tomorrow!
Can't be helped, I'm afraid.
Are you single?
Yes, I'm a single father.
Don't you read books?
You can't just sack me!
We're in a 30 zone!
We're in a 30 zone!
When are we off?
When are we setting off?
Stop eating crayons!
She's wearing red socks
Can I treat you to a coffee?
May I treat you to a coffee?
Do you like reading books?
You're right as always, Tom
Read the paper!
I may be old, but I'm not deaf
Is she your aunt?
It's a right-wing party
The goat bleated: "Maa!
It's easy to learn Interlingua
Don't forget who you are!
I can't work miracles
She doesn't get nightmares
You'll see for yourselves
You don't notice your mistakes
Do you drink enough water?
Let's take things day by day
Do you have children?
I have three cats.
Tom's toupee caught on fire
Tom's parachute failed to open
I haven't said the worst yet
It's a pseudonym
They're rubbing it in
He's not normally so meowy
It's funking freezing!
It was so beautiful!
What will we do tonight?
He didn't know how to do it
She didn't know how to do it
Maybe she can't do it
Maybe he can't do it
Wake me up when we've arrived
I'm Hungarian, what about you?
Have you finished that job?
Have you been smoking again?
She's pitting him against me
Why are you laughing?
I'm telling the truth
What do you want to say now?
Self-defense is important
What is the supreme being?
Self-defense is vital
I'm not that sort of person
I'm not sure about Sunday
Do you hear the alarm?
Mary hasn't read this book
Are they French girls?
I would've needed more time
Thanks!
I look forward to seeing you!
Half four.
Half four?
Is he daft?
Hey, you!
You can't stand there.
Just go over there.
Laze about.
I'm going to take a bath now
I don't know what they like
It's the best option
Does he disgust you?
Is he conscious?
They're from the same team
He'll think about it
They'll never forget you
He doesn't deserve you
Prepare for the worst!
Have you seen Dad?
They're manipulating you
You're going to a party
Here's my house
I've never been to their house
We left the village's house
You hide, and I'll seek
Tom can't quit drinking
I'm interested in photography
That's pretty clever
Who do you take me for?
Can you spell that?
There's no way I wrote that
You're a real smarty pants
Do you even know who he is?
Do you even know who she is?
I love you, darling
They're not saying this
Am I being clear?
Break time!
I can't drink wine
We've cycled a lot this summer
Do you want me to wash it?
Ultimately, nothing came of it
No one's around to help
Where were you earlier?
He says it's love
So, how are you at the moment?
Tom should be back by 2.30
Dad, where did you meet Mum?
Word for word!
It's all because of you
I'm thinking of moving
I don't think so
How was your flight, sir?
Your baggage is there!
Mere pretense won't do
I can't drink green tea
Borrowed wisdom won't cut it
I don't know any English
I want you to be here by 2:30
I've injured my foot
Is the crisis surmountable?
Tom doesn't need to learn it
Tom doesn't have to learn it
Show us what you're drawing
What an absurd opinion!
No, I'm not an angel
I'll get the doctor.
Should I add salt?
They're inseparable friends
Down with capitalism!
Does he have a soul?
Have you slept here?
Can I use it here?
We'll be here tomorrow
I was born in Tel-Aviv
I will wait for you, my love
I'm tired of being married
The table isn't dirty
Math isn't my thing
Look at the size of that line!
It's an unusual storm.
It's nice to have family
Look at Tom's funny long hair!
Tom is an anarcho-liberal
Look here, a spherical thing.
Kick it.
Just kick it.
Phew, I made it.
You're sweating like crazy.
And?
How'd that go?
I lost.
What is her teacher's name?
What is his teacher's name?

My head hurts because I'm sick
Man can't become women
They cut Rima's breasts off

It's my civic duty
That won't solve our problem
That won't solve your problem
I'd love some.
I'd like to go with you guys
I'm sorry for writing so much
One more word and you're dead
Mom, I swallowed my gum!
I'm not afraid of the dark
Come on, I'm not a total wuss
She's a librarian
I'm your creator
A wasp flew into Tom's mouth
What did you promise her?
Must be a blissful existence!
You're clearly mistaken
Arguing won't solve anything
Did you watch the match?
I don't love you any more
Dogs can't distinguish colours
Mum, he's kicking me!
Mum, why is that lady crying?
Listen, I need the toilet
I'll be back in a minute
Why are you up at this hour?
Which is your flat?
Which one is your flat?
I'm afraid of the unknown
Here it is.
I don't want to read it
Throw it away please, John.
You're late.
I don't expect Tom to help me
Is he coming as well?
I hope so.
I have lunch at 1.30 p.m
I'd rather have some beer
I'd rather have a pint
I'm a friend of your brother
I'm a friend of your brother's
I didn't see anything, either
I didn't hear anything, either
The trousers haven't got clean
What is?" asked Mrs. Dowling
How we laughed!
You guys don't know Tom
Am I being too loud?
Am I being annoying?
Great deeds can't die
What do Zionist settlers want?
Ziri is an anti-Zionist rabbi
It's about Palestine
What if he didn't bluff?

Why don't you believe in God?
Don't question the Quran
You can't question the Quran
Muslims can't eat pork
They call themselves "Muslims.

Tom, you really are something!
Don't worship Jesus Christ
I'm proud to be Muslim
Is Muslim blood cheaper?
Is Palestinian blood cheaper?
Go to the women's-only line
It's much shorter
Meanwhile, I want ice cream
Are you interested in Islam?
You don't have to call me
You're just a carrier
I don't like mineral water
Life's too short for that
Do you read Tom's blog?
Nah; life's too short.
We're going up that mountain
It's a great deal
Come and learn, go and teach
Today's the day to work
Can I watch TV tonight?

Can I get a smile?
Can I get a smile?
No.
Can I get a smile?
I'm sitting outside, at a cafe
Furthermore, I can fly
The level is rising!
Can you smile for me?
No.
Merry Christmas!
I'm not a Christian.
So what?
It's secular!
I want to see you smile.
Stop flailing around!
Merry Christmas!
Wow, how embarrassing
How old are you?
What's Tom's superpower?
I worship the Most High.
Snoop Dogg?
Can I get a smile?
Tom: "Honesty.
He says he's an introvert.
Yeah right!
I was thinking the same thing.
Tom doesn't eat eggs
How'd you sleep?
How'd you sleep?
Not well.
It's a bottomless stomach!
Please have a taste!
He's a braggart
Shall we go for a swim?
But I really need this job!
What's up with the sound?
Smile.
Command not found.
Smile.
Please insert bill.

Tom, you're an absolute liar!
I don't get angry often
Wow, another pointed question
Where do your parents work?
Did you come up with that?

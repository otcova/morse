In the room, it is dark
Are you traveling to Germany?
How do I get to the bookstore?
Lobbyists' job is to lobby
I don't usually lie
That's some good advice
Soccer (football) or rugby?
Which one do you do?
I don’t want to be taken in
I don't know what's what
I'm not falling for this again
What made us come to blows?
Why didn't you come?
Do I look fat in these jeans?
Do I look fat in these pants?
I'm a bit rusty
Tom's head is spinning
Mary's head was spinning
They say he's a good doctor
Tom won the hundred-yard dash
Don't forget to buy bread!
Does the offer still stand?
I was not.
I'm sure Tom's fine
I'm sorry
I can't read his handwriting
I can't read Tom's handwriting
I can't read her handwriting
What time did you get back?
I'm my own worst enemy
You're lying!
No, I'm not.
It's not gambling
The train was delayed­
Don't forget what you need
Let go of my arms!
I didn't find anything better
How badly do you want it?
How bad do you want it?
The line isn't moving
You can't cut in like that
It's a good way to meet girls
I'm on a strict diet
Tom can't get that car started
Sadly, the poet died young
It's water
I'm buying bread
Apparently he's sick
It's still hot in September
Arabic isn't complex
Don't you like my book?
Is it too difficult?
Is that too difficult?
But where is our solar system?
Are you naturally blonde?
Would you explode?
Would your blood boil?
Could you survive?
Tom's apartment is spacious
We'll buy a new car next week
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
I was just about to call 911
What happened to you?
Are you hurt?
I wasn't spying or anything
You're right, as usual
I can't tell if you're serious
I can't tell if you're joking
You're just pulling my leg
I can't move
I can't move
You've earned this, Tom
Who is that man over there?
Who is that woman over there?
Who is that person over there?
What's that thing over there?
What is that thing over there?
It's very drafty in here
It's drafty in here
It's really drafty in here
Is that a dog?
Don't worry; it won't bite
I can't read your handwriting
I don't treat you like enemies
I should ask, right?
I don't need lawyers
Nope, I'm not buying it
We'll swim tomorrow
Did you close the window?
Why do I have to do this?
What's the point?
He'll never admit he's wrong
It's hard to throw things out
It's time to clean your room
Don't get sidetracked
I haven't worn this in years
What's in that box?
There's a monster in my closet
What's in those boxes?
Do you like silent movies?
It's a little spicy
It's spicy
It's very spicy
It's used to make risotto
It's not you I'm worried about
Tom has dark, mysterious eyes
The less he knows, the better
The less she knows, the better
I haven't talked to her since
Do you have a prenup?
I haven't talked to him since
Do you think this is a movie?
I can't leave until he comes
That dog runs so fast!
Did you see it?
I haven't talked to Tom since
I'm based in Boston now
We're puzzled
Can we do this?
We'll be in Boston all week
Are they any good?
We'll miss living in Boston
Are they worth it?
Are your lips dry?
We're still living in Boston
You're being rude
She's proud of her high school
I'm a police officer in Boston
There's plenty to do in Boston
We can't interfere
We're fortunate here in Boston
It's time for change
Am I too old for this?
I'd prefer a sandwich
How did you become wealthy?
How did you become so rich?
Um..
Come back here, you scoundrel!
It's not finished yet
We know that he's a brave man
That's it!
I've had it
Why do you rob banks?
He wasn't crying
Do you accept my offer?
That doesn't make sense at all
Come on, Tom
Let's get out of here
Unfortunately, I can't
You act like I don't exist
I presume you're Tom Jackson
Mary, we're your friends
Where is your report card?
Where is your report card?
I already gave it to you.
I'm not ready to talk about it
Why don't you get lost
They got caught red-handed
I'm not stupid
I'm your friend
I'm your friend
I hope you don't mind
Is there hope in salvation?
Where is the cutlery?
I don't hug her
Do you still need our help?
Hurry!
We don't have a lot of time
Again!
Hmm, maybe!
Well said!
I can't look at this calmly
That doesn't really make sense
I've never been so happy
Have at it!
His wondering didn't last long
Off with his head!
Off with her head!
Off with their heads!
When have I ever wronged you?
I like music.
What is that supposed to mean?
Does she really want that?
That isn't a priority
This isn't a priority
The meeting isn't over
That's a tough question
They're not that stupid
You aren't welcome here
There's always next year
There's still a lot left
Help her!
I don't know why I lied to him
I don't know why I lied to her
It's part of her charm
He's very touchy feely
Why do people kiss?
Do you want bread?
Don't kill
Do you like animals?
I will kill you!
I'm going to go and see a film
Wanna come?
I'm going to go and see a film
Do you want to come?
He's a tough cookie
She's a tough cookie
I'm worried
Did you ask your father?
Did you ask your mother?
It's not a date
I'll make you breakfast
Is it true?
That doesn't sound very good
Tom's arm brushed against mine
I don't think we're alone
Are you going to rat me out?
Don't pay attention to her
She's just jealous
I can't believe you did this
I can't believe you did this!
Tom's eyes lit up
Mary's eyes lit up
Did you lose weight?
Did you lose weight?
I wish.
Tom wore a V-neck T-shirt
Let's not rush things
I'd love a good massage
He's at least twice my age
That's just how life is
That's such a cute cat
It's so adorable
Yes, I have read the book
Do you like Seinfeld?
Tom, wake up
It's me
Mary, wake up
It's me
Is it hard being a goalie?
There's no leash law here
This book isn't very good
Maybe it's not interesting
I'm looking for my friend
October 20th was a busy day
That's a comforting thought
That's a depressing thought
That's an interesting topic
It's normal to be scared
What is your greatest fear?
It's normal
It's normal to be scared
I'm scared too, you know
It's normal to be scared
I'm scared too
It's okay for a man to cry
It's okay for boys to cry
It's okay to feel emotions
That's not what I meant
I'm sorry
He doesn't follow any rules
As if!
Save me, you coward!
Kill me, you coward!
Come back here, you coward!
Stand here and fight!
There's time for everything
Do you plan to go to college?
Now you're just overreacting
I'm a dog
I don't want to study
Mary didn't finish her lunch
Mary couldn't finish her lunch
Tom stole Mary's lunch
Were you kissing?
The zipper's stuck
Tom, help me
The zipper's stuck
Can you zip up my dress?
Can you zip me up?
Oh, Mary, you look terrific!
I can't get my dress zipped up
There's a big storm coming
I thought you were asleep.
Me too.
What are those flowers called?
Is it a real tattoo?
Tom, do something
Big boys don't cry
Big girls don't cry
Drink your milk!
Do you drink milk?
Does she drink milk?
Which of these is yours?
What's wrong with that one?
This is very, very important
You don't have to say a word
Selling newspapers isn't easy
That's a controversial theory
The results weren't very good
Most people aren't that stupid
No, everything isn't all right
Oh, that's kind of interesting
One day, somebody will succeed
Uh-oh!
Don’t wait up for me
I’ll be very late tonight
Have you seen Sally of late?
Many thanks, friends
It sounds crazy, I know
Tom, be quiet and listen to me
Tom, shut up and listen to me
Wasn't that what you wanted?
I'm glad we cleared that up
Let's build a bonfire!
Oh, look, a shooting star!
It's very far away
Tom didn't complain once
She didn't complain once
I'm dying of cold
It's so true
Let's go to the waterpark
He's a sourpuss
Don’t think of anything bad
The question is just when!
Water doesn't stay in a sieve
That's how it happened
Is there nothing else?
Today I'm resting up at home
You've been a big help
What's that letter about?
He couldn't take another step
Don't listen to him
He's lying to you
Don't listen to him
Don't listen to her
She's lying to you
Don't listen to Tom
He's lying to you
Storage space isn't a priority
The decision wasn't a surprise
The police can't be everywhere
Is that a smile or a leer?
I did not!
So where are they?
Um..
I'll get back to you on that.
When was the book written?
When was the book published?
Who's the author?
Who is the author?
I just got my driver's license
Does it still work?
Define 'work'.
We don't swim at night
There's not much happening now
Things haven't really improved
Who came to our house?
Bill's been to Japan
She's hiding something
I know it!
He's a real piece of work
There's no need to be rude
Will you do this for me?
Where are you guys now?
Who said it is bad?
They want sex, wealth and fame
What have you done right now?
I've just woken up
She's lucky
What's the point?
I'm still young
Believe me!
I'm not accusing anyone
I didn't get them
Where are all the good men?
Did that work?
It's good fun
It's my style
I'll always love Tom
It's not free
Tom is a good-hearted person
They'll become teachers
We'll kill him
I'm not forgetful
Rather, it is giving love
You've grown up
It's not gold
It's still OK
Could you help me push it out?
Now I'm angry
Tom is a very easy-going guy
That's no fun
We're friends, not lovers
I'll get you some aspirin
Tom ran a half-marathon
Can we get help?
I'm not on Tom's side
We're all right
I've never beaten Tom
Did you steal it?
Tom would never lie.
Do it quick!
Do it quickly!
There isn't a guard
I don't allow you to smoke
They'll get married
When does the bakery open?
Her cousin lives in the U.S
She'll save more money
He can't pick
He can't choose
I don't want a horse
She's wearing hair curlers
Let's give Tom a lift
Please don't hurt Tom
They're doing OK
This isn't cheap
Therefore?
Pardon?
Yummy!
What's your real opinion?
What did she really mean?
What did you really mean?
What did he really mean?
I don't think there is
I don't think there is
What did Tom really mean?
I'm teaching
He's sleeping
She's sleeping
How long were you sick?
Tom's exaggerating
Oh, we're out of sugar
Can I have the sugar, please?
He doesn't know his father
She doesn't know her father
What is a meteor?
Happy Midsummer!
Welcome back!
Tom worked until 2:30
Can we stop there?
What did Tom do wrong?
Tom must've missed something
I'm not good at negotiating
Everyone laughed, except Tom
I don't like hearing myself
Oh, you poor thing
Oh, you poor thing!
Tom didn't make it very far
What if Tom was right?
Don't answer that
Don't get nervous
Don't tell a soul
Can we give Tom a ride?
Don't try so hard
That cat is so cute!
That kitty is so cute!
Don't vote for it
Don't call Tom anymore
Here's your money
Hey, thanks a lot
Is this your new friend?
How many are left?
How hard was that?
Is it still there?
Is life here hard?
Is that really it?
I've never lost to Tom
Is that seat free?
Aha!
He's buying that book
I'm drawn to you
What is he on about?
What a tall mountain!
She’s almost as tall as I am
That's so great!
My vision is blurry from joy!
Marie didn't like that game
By God!
You're really hateful!
Where are my manners?
That's your chance, Tom
Take it!
Okay, I'm leaving now
I like Tom's mindset
I can't play tennis
She doesn't love her husband
Work?
Is that your idea?
Is that your role?
It isn't worth it
It's a great deal
Tom wasn't honest about that
It's all gone now
Tom wasn't seriously wounded
Should we eat?
Oh, I've broken a nail!
I’ve still got a lot of work
It's almost funny
It's already done
Tom won't be with us anymore
It's getting hard
It's great to win
It's hot out here
Tom's condition is worsening
You’ll surely be thrashed
Are you reading the Bible?
To peace.
Love, Mary.
She's a bit of a recluse
Stop singing that song!
You'd make a cute couple
What's mine is yours
Why have you turned it off?
Did you let him know yet?
How long will it take to you?
Don't play dumb
Sorry I couldn't refuse her
He won't deal with it
I'll be within 10 minutes
Will you deal with it?
We've got enough space here
I think he's looking at me
I think he's looking at you
I think she's looking at me
It's kind of small
I think she's looking at you
He's looking at us
He's looking at us now
No, it can't be!
No, it can't be!
He can't be dead!
No, it can't be!
She can't be dead!
Someone's gotta do it
Whaat?
Do you want some?
I'm way over my limit
I'm currently training a dog
I hope she'll like it
I'm watching out for your baby
This kid just isn't possible
I'm waiting for a reply
Snow is white, soot is black
What?
Really?
What's your favorite Anime?
Tom has caught every Pokémon
Tom is a Pokémon trainer
I'm not being rude
Tom, you're being rude
You're being rude to my guest
Let's grab a bite to eat
Don't you get lonely here?
It's kind of cool
Tom's death wasn't a suicide
It's not a luxury
Tom's family moved to Boston
It's not accurate
Tom's first car was a Toyota
It's not an error
Tom's hard work has paid off
It's not bad here
Tom's life is back to normal
It's not official
It's not this one
Did you ask Tom that question?
It's not too hard
Do you think Tom can help you?
It's not yet over
Does Tom regret what happened?
It's not your job
It's now official
It's official now
It's only a guess
Tom doesn't know how Mary died
It's so different
That didn't bother Tom at all
It's so difficult
Tom didn't want to let Mary go
It's sort of cool
There was a girl in Tom's car
It's totally true
There was blood on Tom's face
It's very helpful
I said I didn't know Tom
It's very private
Tom and Mary still aren't here
It's very special
It's very strange
Tom and Mary aren't here today
Tom doesn't like surfing
Tom wouldn't leave Mary alone
My dad's not here
Tom couldn't believe the news
Tom didn't have anything else
Tom didn't like what he heard
Tom didn't talk to the police
Tom didn't think it was right
Now's your chance
Tom didn't take Mary's advice
That's a bad loss
That's a bad spot
That's a big blow
That's a big deal
Maybe Tom thinks I'm dead
That's a big fish
That's a big loss
That's a big step
That's a hard one
No, you are not crazy
Your husband's cheating on you
I don't like being laughed at
It was cowardly, and I'm sorry
I've been pretty distracted
I've been bit by a snake
Why are you peeling the apple?
I've been to a lot of funerals
I've been a terrible host
I've been summoned by a judge
I got grounded for 2 weeks
My car can beat yours!
Want to go for a ride?
That's all it was
That's all we did
Tom must've been tortured
That's been tried
That's big enough
That's exactly it
I'm looking for my car keys
I'm going to Russia
We didn't believe him
I didn't go by train
I'm observing wild birds
I can't afford to lose my job
Tom became Mary's best friend
That's fairly low
That's hard to do
That's hardly new
That's just a lie
Tom did the same thing in 2013
Tom didn't leave the door open
She's a sweetheart
She just can't wait
She's just a babe in the woods
She's singing in her room
She's a little political
She's smart and quite lovely
She's about to be discharged
She's at her tennis lesson
She's more powerful than you
She's lucky to have him
She's better in smaller groups
She's like a dove of peace
She's vital to the mission
She's just a bit nauseous
She's on holiday with a friend
Do you drink rum and Coke?
Why do you always get lost?
Why do I always get lost?
I'm not good at reading maps
Why don't you get lost?
Do you admit that we're lost?
No.
Admit it, we're lost
We're not lost!
We're not lost
Why are men so stupid?
Why are guys so stupid?
Why are men so dumb?
He's just being macho
What is it, darling?
What is it, honey?
You're just being nice
You're just being nice to me
We've both been under stress
How did you get that scar?
It's a long story.
How did you get that scar?
That's not my cup of tea
Halt!
Tom couldn't find the keys
Is she asleep?
I can't stand him any longer
Tom was truthful, I think
That's just nasty
Tom left the party at 2:30 a.m
That's much worse
Tom's room was very clean
That's my destiny
That's my mission
How does Tom feel about it?
That's my mistake
Here are today's ledgers
That's my opinion
That's our future
That's pretty big
That's pretty low
That's pretty sad
That's their plan
That's too simple
That's very crazy
Tom was Mary's third husband
That's what I got
That's what I say
Tom was Mary's older brother
That's what we do
That's what works
That's why I care
Tom is very self-confident
That's why I quit
Where's the toothbrush?
I don't want to ruin my karma.
Mike, how's it going?
I'm utterly speechless
Need I say more?
We're human
Oh dear!
I'm very underwhelmed
Tom left the party at 2:30
They'll handle it
They'll need help
Tom listened to Mary's story
They're all right
Don't worry too much
Pretty!
Don't feed the dog!
I won't tell anyone
It's easy for you to say that
How do I know if he likes me?
How do I know if she likes me?
Don't try to play innocent
I wasn't expecting anyone
But it's not fair!
That's not an opinion
It's a fact
Please don't hurt him
Can you do a handstand?
There's no doubt about it
He's tall
Don't interrupt the elderly
He's your age
They're behind us
I'll be in the car
I know Tom isn't happy here
I've lost confidence in Tom
It wasn't possible
It's a bad problem
It's a big concern
Tom is using Mary's computer
It's a big country
It's a great story
It's easy for them
Tom could've done something
It's good to dream
It's gotten easier
It's happening now
Tom is Mary's youngest child
It's just a rabbit
It's not a gimmick
Tom is Mary's little brother
It's not effective
Do you take debit cards?
It's not expensive
It's taken a while
It's very personal
It's very puzzling
It's way too early
I'm worn-out
She won't be happy about that
He won't be happy about that
Tom won't be happy about that
They won't be happy about that
We're all human
Do you like frozen yogurt?
Do you like strained yogurt?
I'm not Finnish
Don't spoil the mood
I think she's a witch
I don't have any homework
Have you done your homework?
I don't have any homework.
Do I look fat in this dress?
Oh God, I look so fat in this
I'm so fat
I hear you say "Why?
Always "Why?
Do you work alone?
I can't handle his comments
You're the one I love
I hate the mole on your face.
But it is my mole!
I'm good at keeping secrets
Can you touch your toes?
Tom can't touch his toes
Don't listen to rumors
Let's watch a horror movie
We'll set up camp here
I don't like science
There's no silver bullet
Tom's voice broke with emotion
Did you kiss her?
Did you kiss her?
No, I didn't kiss her.
Why did you kiss her?
I don't like the taste
Let's go eat together
I'm happy if you're happy
I've heard her story before
Tom didn't want to harm Mary
It's way too small
It's what I wanted
These aren't cheap
Tom couldn't see Mary's face
Those aren't tacos
Today isn't Monday
I'm a ghost
What do you regret most?
Is this a puzzle?
Can you feel the love tonight?
Did you ever go to Hokkaido?
We haven't found him
We haven't found it
How much do you owe?
Tom's design is very original
Do you have a gym membership?
I have a date tonight.
With who?
Adults are 55-60 percent water
It's one of our specialties
Tom's car was repossessed
Mary brushed Kate's hair
Mary stroked Kate's hair
You don't need to convince me
Who speaks Russian?
He's a well-known impresario
I'm kind of stunned
Tom isn't making much money
It's hard to choose
That's not a museum
It's beautiful
That's not the goal
This isn't gasoline
This isn't my money
We didn't play well
Are you leaving, too?
Did I miss the party?
Is distilled water drinkable?
It was launched in 2015
Why are you so disappointed?
They don't eat anything
I'm glad you invited me
Where did you learn all this?
Have a great weekend!
Same to you!
Let's pick up Tom
Let's give Tom a ride
Let's go for a midnight swim
Did you see the news?
Do you like this car?
Tom doesn't seem to like me
Mary doesn't seem to like me
I'm sure you'll be very happy
Tell me this isn't true
Please tell me this isn't true
I can't control that
I'll show you around
I'm stuck in the mud
I'm taking away your phone
Could it be love?
Isn't that something?
Tom's plan worked perfectly
It doesn't feel good
It wasn't a burglary
Tom's room was pretty clean
It wasn't bad at all
What's wrong with Tom today?
Let's go skating now
Let's make a snowman
Let's try that again
How could that happen to Tom?
Hello.
Hi, this is Tom
At least, that's how he felt
Damn rascal!
Ana's boyfriend is so cloying
He's the scum of the earth
I don't know if that will help
She told him "Nice job!
He answered "No big deal.
The neighbors' dog passed away
I'm not miserable
I'm just not happy
Don't try to be me
Be yourself!
You're arguing just to argue
I'm on the porch
I'm on the deck
It's "segue", not "segway
We'll phone our mother-in-law
I've made a lot of sacrifices
Don't tilt your chair
Don't tilt your chair back
You're a peculiar girl
You're a peculiar girl, Mary
Why is that?
Should we try it out?
The footprints weren't Tom's
That's not realistic
Tom and Mary met in 2013
They're attacking us
Tom bought 30 gallons of gas
Tom claimed he wasn't guilty
Have you done your homework?
I don't have any.
Tom stole Mary's car
Today's my lucky day
Was all of that true?
Was that intentional?
We'll be leaving now
I'm not sure if that will help
Is he cooking too?
It's a despot's dream set-up
I'm going to vote with my head
What's your favorite outfit?
We'd like to leave
Mary doesn't love her husband
Tom isn't good at reading maps
I wish I could've met Tom
Tom doesn't love his wife
Why did you kiss Tom?
Beware of falling rocks!
What is mathematics good for?
Actually, I know that
Who broke the plate?
Which one is your bag?
The more people, the better
He weighs more than 80 kg
She weighs more than 80 kg
Can I join you?
Sure.
What is your height?
As in, how tall are you?
We're sorry about it
Tom couldn't afford a lawyer
What scares you most?
Tom couldn't control his son
I don't think it is over
I don't think it's incurable
Have a ball at the ball!
Have fun at the ball!
Tom couldn't wait any longer
You'll never beat me
It's easy for Tom
Can I stay in the car?
Do you blame yourself?
Don't even mention it
In fact, she lied
How did you get stuck?
I guess it's all over
I won't eat that.
That's your problem
You'll remain hungry.
I'll be on my way now
I'm glad I'm not late
I'm glad to know that
That's all Tom did
Is it taking too long?
Isn't it your day off?
Isn't this refreshing?
That's how Tom won
It's a welcome change
It's been a nightmare
We need to teach him a lesson.
I have an idea.
Will you make it in time?
It's a big animal
That's why Tom won
Let's all go home now
Let's get to work now
I don't like journalists!
That's generous of you
I don't consider them friends
Don't leave me alone here
Please don't go
Don't leave me alone here
Should we do it again?
Tom was there, too
That wasn't very good
That's not big enough
This isn't fun at all
This wasn't expensive
Can I open my eyes now?
We're not officially dating
Can I speak to you in private?
May I open my eyes now?
We'll give you a ride

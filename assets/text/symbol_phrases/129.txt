He's on his way home
She's on her way home
Are you still there?
Is he still there?
Is she still there?
That's a woman's job
That's a man's job
Where's the rest?
Is your daughter here?
He's a hunk
He's an exorcist
She's possessed
Where's the rest of the money?
You've got the wrong man!
I know it's a lie
You're lying!
She's lying
She's lying on the floor
I didn't do what he says I did
Obviously, someone is lying
You're not telling the truth
It's completely natural

I thought you didn't know Tom
I thought you weren't coming
I thought you'd agree with me
I thought you'd agree
I thought you'd ask that
I thought you'd be alone
I thought you'd be at the bar
I thought you'd be dead by now
I thought you'd be different
I thought you'd be grateful
I thought you'd be happy

By car?
Why all this hate?
Listen to her!
That's from the Bible?
Where in the Bible?
Can this car go any faster?
I couldn't live like that
I wasn't talking to you
Let's go on a road trip

Let's go down the street
Let's go and investigate
Let's get you to a chair
Let's get ready to leave
Let's get out of the car
Let's do something crazy
Let's do it after school
Let's do dinner tomorrow
Let's discuss this later
Let's barricade the door
Let's all just calm down
Let's wait until Monday
Let's try and stay calm
Let's talk in my office
Let's talk about Boston
Let's take another trip
Let's stop wasting time
Let's stay here forever
Let's sit down and talk
Let's see if that works
Let's play another game
Let's not wait too long
Let's not talk about it
Let's not point fingers
Let's not kid ourselves
Let's not get into that
Let's not get emotional
Let's keep this private
Let's just try it again
Let's hope you're right
Let's hope Tom is smart
Let's hope Tom is right
Let's hear your opinion
Let's go to your office
Let's go to the kitchen
Let's go to the factory
Let's go to the bar now
Let's go the extra mile
Let's go somewhere, Tom
Let's go out for a walk
Let's go into my office
Let's go back to Boston
Let's give Tom a minute
Let's get started, OK?
Let's get some pictures
Let's get out of Boston
Let's get a closer look
Let's find out for sure
Let's do this carefully
Let's do something else
Let's all stay in touch
Let's watch that again
Let's try to stay calm
Let's talk about death
Let's stretch our legs
Let's set up a meeting
Let's see how you feel
Let's say you're right
Let's play that by ear
Let's play a word game
Let's not do this, Tom
Let's move the dresser
Let's meet for a drink

How does a cow go?
You're making me cry
You're bound to like it
You're a special lady
Tom doesn't need a doctor
Is this the original?
He's under anesthesia
Read it!
We're leaving!
I'll always remember this
Everything is a lie!
Don't take off your shirt
Don't take your shirt off
Who do you love?
Mary.
What if they're not home?
What if they're not at home?
You're going to get married
Can this dog swim?
Dermatologists hate her!
We're almost out of water
Who is this package for?
Definitely for someone.
Who's that package for?
How's this color?
I'll take care of Tom myself
Where is the nearest toilet?
Where's the nearest toilet?
You're going grey, Tom
You're going grey
Why does no one ask questions?
We're open all year round
Is that a joke?
Have you brought a camera?
Did you bring a camera?
Mary thinks she's having twins
Cats forever!
Looks like they're coming
Did you ring me today?
Why?
Wasn't me, honestly!
Channel your fighting spirit!
Has she perhaps forgotten?
I've already seen her
I've already seen them
He's often abroad
Where has he been?
And where is he now?
Where has it been?
And where is it now?
Where's Tom?
Up his own fundament.
She's given me her book
Don't neglect reaching out
He didn't come until midday
He didn't arrive until noon
He didn't arrive before midday
You'd better close the door
Have they told her?
Look, there he is
I'll have a few of those
I'll take a few of those
I can't stay here any longer
Thank you very much!
I'll say goodnight
I'm dead on my feet
She's fed up
She's had enough
She's had a bellyful
May I use this umbrella?
May I use this racket?
In an instant, my life changed
Ask Dad!
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Dad told me to ask you.
Ask Grandad, then!
He's asleep on the sofa.
Tom hasn't eaten in three days
Wake him up, then!
Asleep!
At this time of day?
Have you ever heard the like!
Oi, Tom
How did that get there?
Which tie do you like most?
I'm leaving this evening
Take me home, please.
Have I thanked you yet?
I've seen the price tag
He's not ill
I've got no idea
Where is there a cash machine?
Where's a cash machine?
Everyone's ill
They're brilliant
All right, mate?
Am I being sacked?
Petrol's not cheap any more
I think that maybe it's over
Tom's ill
You're sacked
That'll certainly help
Steady on!
I'm peckish
It's got dark
Come on, let's get the bus
How many caps does Tom have?
Tom's hobby is growing roses
We'll make some changes
Look, she's coming
Look, they're coming
Why not ask Tom for help?
You're all I need to be happy
Why is it closed?
And when will it open?
Thanks, Tom!
I owe you one.
Don't mention it.
He's no longer with us
When are you coming to Japan?
Tom is under thirty, I think
It's just not fair to Tom
What did they hire Tom to do?
You're the one that I want
I've never seen Tom working
Tom couldn't think straight
Tom was wrong, of course
Where are the candles?
Give me a box of matches!
Tom has broken Mary's heart
Wanna become an astronaut?
It's colder than it was before
Will she be there too?
What was Tom hired to do?
Why do cats lie in the sun?
Who else did Tom help?
I didn't think I'd be nervous
Tom didn't get a degree
Where's mom?
You know I've got to help Tom
Let's wait till Tom gets back
Don't be incredulous
Don't be distrustful
Should I read it?
Do you want me to read it?
I'm not Kurdish
I'm from Dersim
I'm from the city of Derik
I'm from Derik
You're from the city of Derik
You're from Derik
Are you also Kurdish?
Yes, I'm also Kurdish
Yes, we're also Kurdish
We're all Kurdish
I'm from Mardin
Tom isn't a soldier anymore
Why did Tom sell his cello?
What a tiny little book!
You're just a demagogue
It's cheaper in bulk
It's a kind of lottery
Up periscope!
Down periscope!
You've always been nice to us
It was a win-win option
What do you think you'll do?
I'm ready to learn
Would you please just go away?
You're a very special lady
Can you vouch for him?
Can you vouch for her?
Please show us what you've got
Won't you please stay?
I'm just a little guy
Who else did Tom kiss?
We've seen the last of it
Is that person over there Tom?
Long live cats!
Can you vouch for Tom?
Do you have any medicine?
Where'd you hear that?
You've really got sharp ears
You're the only one I need
You're the one for me
Is your dog a good swimmer?
We're almost out of money
Tom needs one of these, too
I'm sweating like crazy
Here's what Tom is looking for
Who will protect us from Tom?
We've got a big day tomorrow
I'll come over to yours later
How much were those glasses?
He's playing football tomorrow
He'll play football tomorrow
You must've known I was lonely
I don't believe him any more
I'll wait until she comes
I'll wait until she arrives
Sorry, but that's not possible
Who organised this event?
Who arranged this meeting?
Who wrote this book?
John.
He's got no one to play with
I don't think she'll be coming
Are you ill?
He'll be back before five
Do we need to get the bus?
Do we need to catch the bus?
Have we got to get the bus?
Have we got to catch the bus?
Will he be coming tomorrow?
Is he coming tomorrow?
I'm getting up early tomorrow
We've got no sugar left
Our work isn't valued here
I'm a poor traveler
Go to bed if you're tired
Go to sleep if you're tired
Who else did Tom hug?
Do you hate me?
No, no.
So, you like me, then?
Why do you ask?
Hey!
We can hear it!
We hear!
Such emotions!
Are we even now?
Why not together?
Why did we take him?
Won't you do the same?
Usually, a pot has two handles
Do you know the boy next door?
I know it's kind of expensive
I know it's kind of late
I know it's kind of strange
What a terrible thing to say!
Why did I have to do that?
It's good for you
I really don't mind the rain
Did you really miss me?
You're where you should be
We've got a lot of time
We've got it all
Is Tom always so rude?
You'd better watch your step
You'd better shape up
Why can't we do that here?
Why don't we all go there?
Why can't we just be happy?
Wasn't it Tom who said that?
Wasn't it Tom who did that?
I told you that I'd wait
If you ask me to stay, I will
You've never let me down
Why can't we talk it over?
Why does anyone do anything?
Who could ask for more?
We're going to have a party
We'll probably have to do that
I wasn't hurting anyone
Was it something that I said?
We're here to have a good time
I'll do whatever you do
You're surrounded by friends
When you get home, text me
We've agreed to do that
It's three o'clock in Boston
I won't let Tom exploit me
I'm not feeling any pain
What a mess we've made!
It's time for us to be leaving
I can see what's happening
You didn't even bother to call
Are you sure it won't explode?
My part of the deal's done
Now it's your turn
Don't tell him her address
He's fired
Why not go together?
Where are you based?
To battle!
Woah!
I'd like to take another look
I know that it's expensive
Tom stepped on Mary's glasses
How would I even do that?
What kept you?
Tom, you wrote this part wrong
What's that under your bed?
Mum, I'm going out.
Where to?
University?
Isn't it spring break now?
What are you going there for?
A club?
Looking that smart?
It's all right isn't it?
Seriously?
This chicken is rock-hard
When was this house built?
These aren't exactly the same
Tom was cross-examined
I looked into Tom's eyes
It's rude to point
Tom's house is old
Tom's smile faded
Shall we take a vote?
This isn't what I expected
Tom's left foot is swollen
Tom's heart sank
Things are bound toÂ get better
How did he do?
How did he manage?
I think he'll do just fine
Tom didn't interrupt me
Will you attend the meeting?
It's getting cooler every day
When does the store open?
Where is the store located?
How about a night out?
You're not a bad person
That wasn't exactly a surprise
It's obvious that you're right
I've heard enough already
She's looking for you
Tom couldn't hear anything
I'll have Tom call you
I'll tell Tom to call you
Tom wasn't at school that day
How did Tom treat you?
Tom isn't good at his job
It's buffering
Can I look in the phone book?
I've been studying all day
Please don't lock the door
I don't need your love anymore
It's Murphy's law
I don't think he would mind
I don't think he would object
What will happen if I do this?
Is chivalry dead?
Are you a piano player?
What do you think about Tom?
Ziri didn't see Rima there
Why?
Why wasn't Ziri happy?
How was the test?
There's no way
Look over at the window!
They just hit a mine!
Let's put Tim front and center
He's going to one in the city.
How is he getting there?
Don't invite Tom here again
As just introduced, I'm Tom
Careful, it's loaded
I don't speak programmer
I didn't pee myself
How could you miss it?
How could you have missed it?
If you hate it, you hate it
If you like it, you like it
Can we get him out of jail?
Smash that like button!
Unfortunately, I can't come
I'm used to this heat
Who built this wall?
This isn't exactly legal
Will you be at the meeting?
Tom needs a full-time job
It must've rained
I didn't expect Tom's help
We're waiting for an ambulance
I'd also like to go
That's something I hate doing
Riding a horse isn't easy
It's not clear what Tom wants
There's been a change
We're about to run out of food
Tom wasn't sure about that
We're almost out of food
That's something I have to see
Are you married?
Yeah I am.
No, nothing at all.
I wonder how she's doing
It's not factual
Didn't he just show up?
Is this supposed to be a gift?
We're not withholding anything
How could I have saved them?
Tell me, what am I to do?
If that happens, ring me
If that happens, phone me
Say I'm ill
Tell them I'm ill
I've been ill
Tell him I'm ill
I'm rarely ill
I'm hardly ever ill
Tom hasn't rung
Tom still hasn't rung
I've been sacked
Why are your clothes so dirty?
He's tetchy
Do you think you can get away?
I've got to get my skates on
I'm not ill
I'm not ill any more
I'm no longer ill
I can't go
I'm ill
I can't come because I'm ill
Look, Mary
Look, Mary
Ziri wants to go there, too
I'll destroy you one by one
It's not your cup of tea
She's wearing a green dress
Tom's alarm didn't go off
I'm tired of living with you
I can't explain his behaviour
Why must you make me suffer?
At ten past seven, he gets up
Now he's in a hurry
Here's a cool new sentence
She doesn't have much money
The meeting won't take place
The meeting isn't taking place
I'm sure Tom will do just fine
So what if he's dangerous?
Tom didn't seem ready to go
It's not your forte
What are you in for?
Don't move a muscle!
Why did you hurt his feelings?
Don't dream about toilets
I'm not creative enough
I'm not hungry, thank you.
He's still going!
Do you think he hurt himself?
Does that place even exist?
I'll get you some more coffee
What's wrong?
Mr. Smith is not available
The teachers didn't care
They weren't interested in us
It's alright isn't it?
I guess it can't be helped
What do you want to eat?
Why are you only mad at me?
Mary did the same thing too.
That's amazing!
Nice!
I'm so happy.
He's a really healthy baby boy
It's twenty minutes to four
How often do you run into Tom?
We don't live near a big city
I'll buy you what you want
Tom couldn't get over it
Tom's name wasn't on the list
They're all laughing at you
That isn't really important
When did Buddhism enter Japan?
Tom is a character, isn't he?
It's not a masterpiece
It's a mistake
You're overthinking it!
You were overthinking it!
Can I come to your place?
Is Tom a little drunk?
What'll happen if I do this?
You aren't a bad person
That picture isn't real
It's been photoshopped
I don't care about that guy
What should I do?
The door's shut tight
That's how it'll stay
And that's how they did it
By the way, what time is it?
We've got nothing else to do
I hear you've got a boyfriend
Why would anyone ever do that?
Tom told Mary what he'd bought
Where's my bicycle?
We've got nothing else to lose
I don't think Tom would object
How many songs do you know?
Tom hasn't noticed yet
I'm in the twelfth grade
I'm a twelfth grader
Tell me why you're doing that
Tom's shirt is blue
What is history?
What is an autobiography?
What is a dynasty?
Where are the pyramids?
What is a sphinx?
What is an obelisk?
What are hieroglyphics?
What is the Rosetta Stone?
Aren't you at university?
Did you go to university?
Have you been to university?
Is Tom playing football?
Have you ever got lost?
How are we doing on time?
I'll go to hospital
I'm in hospital
Does your offer still stand?
Was the door shut?
Has the door been closed?
I didn't know you knew I knew
I don't serve them tea
I'm not serving them tea
He's not a bad-looking bloke
I'll talk to you again later
I'm just going to the loo
How old would you say I am?
How much will you give me?
How many will you give me?
Catch him, or he'll get away!
Come!
It'll be fun
I'll buy her a chair
What happened?
The numbers don't lie
Is it good?
It's an acquired taste.
That's incredibly stupid
Mom, please!
Come on, Mom!
Don't 'mom' me!
I'm thinking of selling my car
Do you know something?
Why can't it?
She doesn't know that I know
Tom, come out!
I'm allergic to chalk dust
It's not a secure password
We didn't notice anything
I can't go back on my word
I'm suicidal
And your bike?
Me, I'm crazy about kielbasa!
I'm not a countess
I don't want to lose my streak
How do you earn your living?
I've wagered everything I own
Was that directed at me?
Way to go, loser!
Ziri can't tell Rima anything
I've known her for two years
How about I call you tomorrow?
He's a famous pianist
We'll stay until the end
Everyone is here, we can start
He's a stocky man
We don't have time to lose
It's quite an old building
Let's hope they leave us alone
There's no way I could do that
Is this what it's all about?
Don't tell anyone I told you
I can't find the bathroom
Don't touch the walls!
The paint is still fresh!
I'd be fine
I'd be totally unfazed.
Shit!
I'm going to be late
Yeah, she does
Don't bother me
Oh, Tanaka-san!
Uh...!
Have you been doing well?
Um, uh...!
What's your name again?
Really?
I'm Kunisada
Keiko Kunisada.
Oh, right, Kunisada-san
It's been a while!
You're right where you belong
I'll teach Tom how to fight
Promise me you'll stay with me
Can you take me to the store?
What about your bike?
Somebody stole it.
What's the opposite of "cold?
What's the opposite of "up?
What's the opposite of "wet?
What's the opposite of "top?
What's the opposite of "love?
This isn't true either
You should've consulted me
Tom won't be working either
He's too unsociable
Do they mean it?
I'm no scientist
If in doubt, ask Tom
What did Tom propose?
He'd got it all wrong
It's my job to wash up
Tom hadn't done it right
Tom didn't do it correctly
What films are on this week?
Are there any seats left?
Are there any seats free?
Let's tidy the desk
I'm wet through
I'm drenched to the skin
Quiet, otherwise he'll hear us
She's eloquent
She's articulate
I understand Tom's perspective
I haven't seen the video yet
That's a high-rise, isn't it?
Must I give him a reason?
I'm thirsty
I'd like a cold drink
The room can hold 200 people
This rule doesn't always apply
I need to sleep!
This cake is delicious!
Where did you buy it?
He has a rock-solid alibi
I'm not sure if I'll manage
I'm not sure if I can do it
Come on, eat your tea
I've already got up
I'm already out of bed
What's wrong?
This is the poet's birthplace
I've read my notes
I think it's quite good here
I'll fetch it later
I'll pick it up it later
I'll collect it later
That bloke's a petrolhead
I'll find my own way
We don't have any time to lose
It's too hot
It's too hot
Are you both ready?
They're Norwegian
I'm amazed by your naivety
Have you ever been lost?
He's an unstable person
I'm eating a book
That didn't convince them
They weren't convinced by that
We're having a party tonight
Is there any hope?
The key's been lost for ages
Nothing's visible from here
What could it have been?
You've got your father's eyes
What?
You don't want to bet?
Are you a pagan?
What?
Don't you want to bet?
Are you a heathen?
It's yours
He's never been to Paris
Now you're starting to get it
Don't play the martyr
Dang it!
When exactly did you see it?
Countess, you are charming
What did he give you?
You've been so good to me
Do you hate that?
Yup.
I hate it too.
I'll be gone for a day or two
I'll be gone a few days
I hope I'm not wrong
How old did Tom say Mary was?
A Coke, please
She's too ugly
Call a doctor!
You can't change that
He's crazy about cats
Do you like my hat?
Does Tom have a weapon?
Is infinity a real number?
Does Tom have a pink shirt?
I'd swap them around
I'd change their places
What's this on the floor?
Why is this on the floor?
Ew!
Did you step on something?
Let's swap seats
Sign here and here, please
She's his current wife
She's her current wife
I don't want to see Tom here
Is your number still the same?
I won't be able to make it
Oh, no!
I'm built different
I've been a bean
I'm going to make some coffee
Do you want any?
Yes, thank you
What can we expect from them?
Heathens!
I'll be gone for a few days
I'll be gone in a few days
Where's your bike?
Where's your motorcycle?
Where's your bicycle?
Let's rent a row boat
I don't know how long I slept
Why aren't you asleep yet?
It's very stuffy in here
Can we open a window?
Can you hear me?
Yes, I can.
Did you see them yesterday?
No, I didn't.
Sorry, I forgot.
Are you sick?
I'll go make some food
What would it mean for Tom?
Why do dogs bite their owners?
Ziri's cat was wounded
Is it really Tom's fault?
Does Tom have a watch?
Does Tom know we know?
Does what Tom think matter?
Does Tom's opinion matter?
Does Tom know about us?
You're such a pretty girl
Does Tom ride every day?
It's way too early to leave
Is Mary your sister?
Who will dance tonight?
Will Tom be coming by bus?
Is Tom coming by bus?
We can't leave yet
Why won't they stay here?
Tom's sister and I are friends
She's thrilled
Ziri's door was shut
Can I bum a cig?
I didn't like what you said
Is Tom already here?
Is Tom here already?
Tom isn't yet here
Is Tom seeing someone?
Does Tom have a scooter?
Is Tom a patient of yours?
Is Tom a patient here?
Is Tom still a patient here?
Does Tom work hard?
Why is Tom laughing at us?
Of course not, darling
Of course not, my dear
Could you leave him alone?
Tom's sick
Are they having problems?
Is Tom from Boston, too?
Is Tom really serious?
If you really need me, call me
The temperature's rising
Is Tom really afraid of Mary?
Is Tom afraid of Mary?
Is Tom reading a book?
It just can't be done
We won't be able to do that
That just can't be done
Is Tom still in bed?
Is Tom drinking milk?
Is Tom coming as well?
Will Tom be coming, too?
Will Tom also be coming?
Will Tom be coming as well?
I'm having such a good time
Is Tom hard of hearing?
Why can't we do that together?
Is Tom hiding something?
I think that it's worth a try
Why is Tom looking for Mary?
Is Tom ready to talk?
Is Tom going to make it?
Will Tom be able to make it?
Oh, hey look!
There's Tom's new beau.
He's checked
She's checked
I'll ask Tom one more time
Is that important to you?
Why aren't you here yet?
Why are you still in bed?
Is Tom still looking at us?
Is that Tom talking to Mary?
Does Tom pay you well?
Is Tom interested in art?
Won't you leave me alone?
Is Tom self-employed?
Does Tom really want it?
I'll just leave it up to you
I'm eight years old
He's a bit superstitious
Kids, drink milk every day!
Is that your daughter, Tom?
Everyone's waiting for you
Oh Baby, what a place to be!
What did I see?
Theoretically, it's possible
I hope you didn't smoke
They didn't tell Ziri
Pass the potatoes, please
Are you coming early?
Ziri doesn't need a moustache
What do you want?
I need something.
Do you need money?
Yeah.
Be gone.
You can be Romeo.
I'm flattered.
Please don't scare the kids
Ziri was holding Rima's hand
We're from Algiers
Ziri entered Rima's class
Ziri wrote Rima's phone number
Where the heck are you?
Ziri, you're my hero!
Ziri visited Rima's apartment
Ziri hid Rima's letter
Move out of the way.
No problem.
What's this?
It's a flush.
Interesting concept.
Are you calling Dad a liar?
What's his name?
Ziri.
Ziri?
Sounds like a typo.
It's a Berber name.
What?
Are we in love?
Are we really in love?
Says who?
Says me, that's who!
It's not raining outside
I said no soda pop.
It's not soda
It's juice.
Ziri's planet exploded
Rima isn't that attractive
Did you fix the bike?
Ziri is Rima's caregiver
Ziri threw away Rima's flyers
Ziri's confession is real
The woman is Ziri's mother
What are your names?
Ziri and Rima.
Ziri isn't ashamed
I'm innocent.
That's what they all say.
I don't need therapy.
That's what they all say.
We're waiting for rain
I'll tell you the truth.
Now we're getting somewhere.
I'll tell you what I know.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Hey, baldy, come here.
Don't call me baldy.
Ziri's son is sexy
Ziri is Rima's first love
Ziri's heart really hurt
Ziri was my father's favorite
Did Mary see you leaving?
I hope not.
Why did you tell them that?
Ziri isn't drinking that milk
I'm always barefoot at home
It didn't rain
Unfortunately, it didn't rain
Ziri didn't succeed that year
Ziri didn't meet Rima at all
Ziri's heart was very broken
We shouldn't do it either
I'll have some sausage
He's really serious
Ziri is Walid's best friend
Have you lost your mind, Ziri?
Ziri claimed he was Rima's fan
Let's go through the graveyard
It's shorter that way
Ziri is one of Rima's fans
Ziri can't hear anymore
Ziri isn't good at bowling
Ziri knows Rima can't hear
Ziri is Rima's baby's daddy
Ziri searched Rima's room
Ziri checked Rima's room
Ziri chatted with Rima's room
Where is Mr Yazid?
Ziri doesn't say anything
What is with that principal?
He's treating me like shit
Ziri's career is over
Can I see you in the hall?
Ziri bumped into Rima's friend
Ziri's cellphone wasn't there
Where's his mother?
I don't have a heart
I live in Mascara, Algeria
I'll arrange a gun for you
Your mom is right, Tom
Who else wants seconds?
What did you feed him?
What did you feed it?
Do we have bait?
He's going there alone
I doubt he'll agree
What lake is this?
I've got the map
It's a pretty common name
It's a fairly common name
It's a powerful weapon
She had heart-shaped earrings
Are you a Berliner?
Nope, I'm a hamburger.
Why didn't you come to class?
I'm Tom's mum
Honestly, it's tiring
Is Tom about?
Was Tom sacked?
Has Tom been sacked?
The meeting ended at 3PM
Can you skip?
Have they sacked you?
Did they sack you?
He's in the team
Do I swear too much?
Let's have a butcher's
Let's have a look at that
May I help you, madam?
Why are you lot here?
Why did they sack Tom?
They're in the same team
I'm fed up with queuing
The Eiffel Tower, of course!
In 1932, he was in Paris
He was in Paris in 1932
I'm happy to be with you
I can't get to sleep tonight
Oh no!
What's wrong?
I'm buying a mobile tomorrow
You're pointless
Are there any en suite rooms?
We're going for a drink
Didn't you see that woman?
What's your favourite fruit?
How much did you pay?
About twenty euros.
Oh, that is cheap!
We're all present
The meeting isn't over yet
Oh, that book?
It's on my desk
I hate my voice.
Really?
Golden Week is finally here!
Why would anyone say that?
I've got a real bad headache
I've met Tom a number of times
What a lovely scene!
You will learn, but be patient
Rats!
Has your appetite changed?
You want a hug?
Turn on the stove, please
Hip hip hooray!
Why did he have to stop?
Why did she have to stop?
Why did you have to stop?
One more step and I'll shoot!
I'm a hero in her eyes
They're all new recruits
They're all conscripts
He's a conscript
Don't dwell on failures

Have you met Tom yet?
Can you see Tom's boat?
Are you the new nanny?
Are you Finns or Russians?
Are these dishes gluten free?
Is Tom still in town?
Is Tom ready for this?
Is Tom ready for that?
Is there a better way?
Is the wait worth it?
Is that funny to you?
Is that a real option?
Is that a good place?
Is that a fair share?
Is it worth your time?
Is it the right time?
Is it still worth it?
Is it really fair?
It's time to have fun
It's time for a vote
It's still a bad idea
It's really up to you
It's now ready to use
It's not an easy task
It's not an easy job
It's great to be with you
It's good to be alive
It's easy to see why
It's downright scary
It's been great fun
It's been fun so far
It's been fun for us
It's been a tough week
It's been a good year
It's been a good week
It's as plain as day
It's as easy as that
It's a very tough job
It's a very good sign
It's a long way away
It's a full time job
Let!
Let!
Let!
Let!
I'm farsighted
He's an agnostic
Does he have an alibi?
He's a general practitioner
He's an amateur actor
What a useful gadget!
She's an audiologist
She's Australian
He's Australian
Long live the king!
Do girls also masturbate?
Yes, why not?
We're both students
We're relatives by marriage
He's spreading false rumors
She's spreading false rumors
We're related by marriage
Don't forget your passports
She's in prison
She's in jail
Robin is Batman's friend
She's asocial
He's an astronaut
He's an atheist
He's flexible
Why were you so slow?
She really doesn't like dogs
It is an army of 70.000 men
What is your philosophy?
Stop jumping on the bed!
I know that it's difficult
We really don't have time
You're blocking my driveway
Don't just sit there!
Move!
Have you lived here?
Tom really doesn't like dogs
Tom doesn't really like dogs
Tom doesn't really like Mary
Tom isn't a rich man
Tom isn't a good guy
We'll visit you sometime
She is Alan's wife
I'm too small
Are you drinking wine?
It's the last train
Must I stay home today?
Did you drink wine?
Toshio, who do you like?
I'm catching a cold, I believe
Are there books in your house?
Was Tom very busy?
What sort of book did you buy?
Don't be a baby!
You lying bastard!
What's wrong about this one?
It's too perfect.
Wow, that was close
Really!
I can't go on without Tom
It'll be lots of fun
It wasn't a long list
What are quarks made of?
Are you still with us?
Are you ready to work?
Are you ready for it?
Are you having fun yet?
Are you happy or not?
Are you a good golfer?
There's not much more to say
There's no need to panic yet
The man's name is Tom
That's not up to you
That's likely true
That's likely not true
That's a good song
Your time's up
Will Tom stay with us?
Whose side is Tom on?
Who are the bad guys?
When will the store open?
What's the goal?
We've been on a roll
We've been fortunate
We're not used to it
We're good at it
Was that good or bad?
Was that a good idea?
Blondes aren't dumb
Tom isn't a young man
Tom isn't a happy man
Tom can't ride a bike
Tom can't be far away
More tea?
Why are you so scared?
What did you see?
Is this drinking water?
Will you be ready soon?
We've lost too much
We know it's a hassle
We haven't yet been told
We haven't been told yet
Tom's sister is a nun
Tom won't let us down
Tom wasn't ever in Boston
Tom wasn't a nice man
Tom took over in 2013
Tom says that's a lie
Tom is good at it, too
They think it's a toy
Was it of help?
Was it useful?
This way, please
How can we refuse?
It isn't that easy
It's a lovely idea
It's kind of scary
It's not so simple
Let's not be naive
Who exactly is Tom?
Why is it my fault?
It's Tom's own fault
It's been very quiet
When's your bedtime?
It's not that bad yet
This is good stuff!
I'll see you at six-thirty
Oh, a chocolate bunny!
Why can't you stay?
We're in trouble now
You've made us proud
There's no set policy
Tom said he's healthy
We know you're a coward
We won't let you down
We're glad to be here
We're not proud of it
When is your bedtime?
Where on earth is Tom?
Who knows what it was?
Who said life is fair?
Will we see Tom again?
You're always working
Are they all like this?
Are you a baseball fan?
Are you afraid of rats?
Can we just start over?
Can you make Tom laugh?
Have you ever seen one?
How can Tom be stopped?
Play it again, Sam
Hindsight is always 20/20
Don't trust anybody over 30
It’s too crowded
Beam me up, Scotty
It's an indecent proposition
No, I don't sing
When are you leaving for Rome?
How is your grandmother?
Stop that thief!
What kind of cars do you like?
Can you contact me?
Did he ever study?
Could it have a future ?
How is it put together?
How long will Tom last?
How much is that worth?
How old are you really?
Is coffee good for you?
Is it all resolved now?
It hasn't been too hot
It hasn't been too cold
It just wasn't our day
It was all Tom's fault
It wasn't a total loss
It wasn't an easy sell
It'll be a fun weekend
It'll be a tough match
It'll pay off later on
It's been a crazy year
It's been a great year
It's been great so far
It's never fun to lose
It's nice to be needed
It's no problem at all
It's not a money issue
It's not a new problem
It's not a real choice
It's not an easy sport
It's now time to relax
It's only been one day
It's taken a long time
It's too easy that way
It's very tough to win
Tom says that he's healthy
Look at what you've done
Are you happy?
Just what was the plan?
So what are your plans?
So what if that's true?
So what's the plan now?
Thank you so much, Tom
This isn't all we have
Who will go get the pide?
Tom isn't afraid of us
Tom isn't smart at all
Tom isn't the only one
She's rich, but he's not
You're not helping the poor
You don't help the poor
Let's keep an eye on that
I see he's still asleep
That doesn't happen every day
I'm going to let you go
Did I come at a good time?
There's no crime in that
Could you please take me home?
Tom was killed in 2013
Tom's wife is a lawyer
Is Tom really busy?
Is Tom really sick?
Is Tom really happy?
It still isn't over
It sure wasn't easy
It's still not easy
Tom just won't stop
We're not like that
How are you managing?
Is Tom really guilty?
Is that possible now?
What more can you say?
A little more respect please!
You won't be able to prove it
You won't be able to try it
You won't be able to try it on
Men are all the same!
Is the shop close?
I'll call you when I have time
I'm going to Paris tomorrow
This doesn't look so good
Tom works part-time
It's okay for you to be here
Today I'm very proud of myself
I don't want to ruin your day
Is Tom really Canadian?
It's not easy in there
Was it a hard decision?
Was that Tom out there?
We're all sick of this
We're happy to be here
We're not the bad guys
We're part of the team
We're ready to move on
We're very discouraged
We've had a great week
It was entirely Tom's fault
What are we paying for?
What's Tom up to today?
Where were you in 2013?
Who can it possibly be?
Are you happy with this?
Are you really too busy?
Can you please sit down?
Can't we all be friends?
How can this be stopped?
How can we prevent that?
How long will this last?
How much time is enough?
Is Tom faster than Mary?
Is Tom richer than Mary?
Is Tom taller than Mary?
Is it a good investment?
Is this what Tom wanted?
What are the facts?
Whose land is this?
It's worth the money
Let's keep it simple
There's a pattern here
There's a waiting list
There's no one missing
Of course it isn't true
Of course it's not true
Of course, Tom is wrong
That guy's name was Tom
That isn't funny at all
What's Tom doing today?
That wasn't a good idea
That wasn't so long ago
That's a long ways away
That's a real good sign
That's a very tough job
That's absolutely wrong
That's not a good thing
That's not an easy feat
That's not how we think
That's the plan for now
That's what our goal is
The baby's name was Tom
The game isn't over yet
It's not a date or anything
People aren't always rational
The news isn't all good
The store is jam-packed
There's a sick man here
There's no need to wait
This isn't an easy task
This isn't good for Tom
Let's look at the map
Don't open it
It's nothing serious
I don't bear him a grudge
It isn't always easy
Eat your soup while it's warm
How long have you liked Tom?
Tom's success spurred us on
Let's play Minecraft!
It's beautiful weather today
This was all Tom's idea
Are you hungry?
I'm not hungry
His salary rose 10%
Tom is right, of course
Tom isn't a good singer
Tom isn't a good worker
Tom isn't a kid anymore
Tom isn't that far away
Tom likes the idea, too
Tom said he's no expert
Tom says he's innocent
Tom is a crypto-fascist
There's no need for pessimism
I don't like stubborn people
I'm not afraid of growing old
We know that's not true
We're all tired of this
We're all trying to win
We're not ready to quit
We weren't tired at all
We've had enough of you
Who are they talking to?
Who are those three men?
Who else uses this room?
Now off with you to school!
Could I borrow your cell?
Why are you angry at me?
Don't spit into the wind
Do I make a lot of mistakes?
We aren't kids anymore
Where are you leading us?
Does Tom want a car?
We can't be friends anymore
Why are you so paranoid?
Why are you all shocked?
We're here to play golf
What a nice looking car!
Where are you based now?
Why is this our problem?
Are you involved in this?
Have you seen Tom's room?
Here's a problem for you
How old is this airplane?
I didn't mean to be rude
I don't feel like walking
I'm resting my legs
I'll see if Tom can help us
Is Tom still on vacation?
It's a risk we have to take
Let's rest for five minutes
Let's sit for five minutes
How many eggs did Mother buy?
I'm almost certain about that
That's not a reason to panic
Papa, I'm not joking!
I'm pregnant
She told me "good night.
You have bewitched me!
Everyone behave naturally!
Today I call it “MATURITY”
Today I call it “SIMPLICITY”
Today I know “THAT IS LIFE”!
What do you want meaning for?
Life is desire, not meaning
I'm the same
Tom's the real expert
She's the real expert
Someone help me, please
Is it a French wine?
Horses don't like trailers
Do you like spinach?
What's not to love?
That's a lie, of course
That was a lie, of course
You are a little late!
Can I have a copy of it?
Don't try to stop me!
Behave yourself, kid!
I'm a villager
That doesn't scare me one bit
Today you don't need to work
I'm not calming you down
Welcome, everybody
Welcome, everyone
How does one stop smoking?
I'm not a specialist
They're awfully heavy.
I don't get sick very often
Have you ever been there?
How desperate can you be?
Is there a marina nearby?
Isn't this what you want?
It really isn't that bad
You're still a neophyte
He's vile
That's just a personal opinion
I'm sitting alone in my house
It wasn't a pleasant job
Who will succeed the throne?
You don't need to work today
OK, let's begin!
It's a funny story
It's a system that works
It's a very slow process
It's definitely possible
Don't scream in my ear!
Would you help carry this up?
Let's not press our luck
It's just what we need
It's hard being a parent
Here?
Should we run?
Did you wash up?
I'll survive
Get dressed!
Were you amazed?
I'm confused about my feelings
Good morning, sleepy head
Tom, what are you doing?
What does it look like?
Tom, what are you doing?
Do you like it or not?
Were you ever married?
Who broke the mug?
He's spotless
That's good to know
It's not at all uncommon
It's not at all uncommon
In fact, it's very common
I'll decide what to do
Forty-five times two is ninety
John couldn't play the guitar
You'd better look at it
You're just wasting our time
Tom can't afford bail
Can we be friends?
Wanna come?
It's simply a fact
That is self-evident
Where do you want to travel?
Whose fault was that?
Who's telling the truth?
Who are those three women?
When will Tom leave Boston?
What's the name of your hotel?
I don't want cooked rice
I'm not spoiling their view
Tom's library card is expired
I don't want any rice
We've been told not to do that
We've spent too much money
Don't stand next to me
I'm not sociable enough
I've worked hard all my life
Why do zebras have stripes?
We'll see Tom next week
We're both very proud of you
We're not on the same team
We're proud of our team
We're very proud of Tom
Don't turn it off yet
Who's this message for?
Whose money is this?
Why isn't that an option?
You aren't alone anymore
Why do people have children?
Who's faster, you or Tom?
Who made the decision?
Where's Tom's father?
What's the problem now?
What's in the fridge?
Run for the hills!
We're not yet through
We're still not sure why
We're very proud of that
We're working hard on it
We've met several times
Work hard, play hard
Who will pay the wall?
We're not so confident
We're happy together
We're capable of that
We're all ready for that
We're about the same age
I paid for Tom's ticket
How much rent do you pay?
Let's get back on track
We'll be up late tonight
We'll never let you down
We'll pay for this later
We're a pretty good team
We're a real tight group
Tom's eyes lit up suddenly
I'm still at the university
We weren't aware of that
Let's party like it's 1999
I'm from the same town as her
On the horizon, I see land
Don't worry
Thanks for the lesson!
That's highway robbery
That's highway robbery!
A little work won't kill you
He works from 8 to 5
Was Tom faster than Mary?
Tom's real name isn't Tom
Tom won't be around long
Tom will take Mary's job
Tom wasn't in the office
Tom wasn't home alone
I'm not dancing for them
I don't add sugar to my coffee
There's no table in the room
Tom thinks you're stupid
They don't need money
I couldn't call you
Don't kiss me
Tom said that isn't true
Tom says that's not true
Tom says that's not fair
Tom said he wasn't happy
Tom is Mary's only son
Tom is Mary's oldest son
Who wrote the two letters?
What's my doctor's name?
It's futile to feign illness
The lagoon's water is cold
Tom can't move very fast
This wasn't an easy task
This isn't worth the wait
Get him out of there!
This isn't worth it
This isn't really true
They've been here before
Smoking or nonsmoking?
No, thank you
No, thank you
I've already eaten
I'm going to read
I don't like people like Tom
Tom was praising you, you know
What's scary?
Why are you stopping now?
Doesn't that look fun?
We'll stop here for today
Tom's somewhere in the park
There's been no one here
There's a lot of traffic
That's totally wrong
That's not true either
That's not their fault
That's not a solution
That's not a big problem
That's just the idea
That's a good response
Would you forgive me?
Long live the Ukraine!
Glory to the heroes!
He doesn't understand English
You're no good
My fate isn't in your hands
One hears with one's ears
Oh, my tongue!
We'll lose time
I don't knock on their door
I'm taller than he is
I'm not an addict
She's not poor
What do you like to read?
OK, that's all for today
Oh, just put it anywhere
My sister is so irritating!
What should I do?
What should I do?
Hey!
I'm Sepideh
One thinks with one's brain
That's not her fault
Let's take a breather
Of course, it's not true
Feel the burn!
It's Tom's problem now
It's not very durable
It's not true anymore
It's not quite enough
I'd rather get a divorce
That's a good movie, too
He can't take it anymore
He can't stand it anymore
I'd like to finish the job
He's no eagle
Be here at six o'clock sharp
It's a tough situation
It's always dark there
They're very close friends
I'm not counting you
The hell with physics!
You're the one I love the most
I won't wait forever
I wasn't ready for this
Are they hiding?
Was this supposed to be funny?
Which blanket is dirty?
How did they go to town?
Here's the funny part
Bosses are people, too
Anyway, it all worked out
Anyway, let's take a look
Are things any better now?
Are you good with numbers?
Are you really that naive?
At least it wasn't boring
At least that part's true
Can anyone truly be happy?
Have you ever been robbed?
How many people are there?
How many people live here?
How serious is the crisis?
Isn't it always like that?
Isn't it better like this?
Isn't that a little harsh?
Isn't that what they want?
It probably won't be easy
Switzerland isn't Sweden
I'm sorry I misspelled it
I wasn't waiting for you
Can you see what's missing?
Both Tom's parents are deaf
I'm not thirsty at the moment
I don't know when I will die
I'm not in the office today
I'm not at work today
Australia isn't Austria
Which is right: Iraq or Iran?
Germany isn't Kurdistan
Austria isn't Australia
Action, not words
Do the police know about this?
Here's an even better idea
How does this work exactly?
How many people work there?
I don't think he's a lawyer
Don't put the baby in the bag!
They've located Tom
How long did that take?
Is that your new boyfriend?
Is that only a coincidence?
Is that just a coincidence?
I'm not sure what that means
I'm not sure that's all true
I can't wait till next week
How was that decision made?
Don't wake me
That dog's name is Ken
Is that your new friend?
Is that your new girlfriend?
I wonder why he wasn't there
I couldn't hear you very well
And that's that!
How many days are in a month?
Are you planning on voting?
Can this problem be solved?
Isn't that against the law?
Isn't that worth some risk?
Isn't this kind of obvious?
It really isn't that simple
It turns out Tom wasn't lying
I'm a demon
He's a demon
I'm talking to you as a friend
I'm not censoring you
Grab him!
It's actually rice milk
Grab it!
It's doable, but not easy
It's been kind of chaotic
It's already much too late
It's actually a good idea
It's a waste of resources
It's a very touching story
It's a very special place
It's a very serious matter
It's a very serious issue
It's a very large property
It's a very important step
It's a very complex system
It's a very big difference
It wasn't like this before
It wasn't always like that
It wasn't a secret meeting
It wasn't a hard decision
Right now I'm not thirsty
It's just not good enough
It's made a big difference
It's nice to have choices
It's not a good situation
It's not a happy occasion
It's not a perfect system
It's not a secret anymore
It's not always like that
It's not always like this
It's not at all surprising
Let's look at some options
It's still snowing in Boston
It's really hot right now
It's probably a good idea
It's not just Tom's problem
It's not good for anybody
It's not even October yet
He's at the hotel now
What language do you speak?
As soon as he saw me, he fled
It's the first step
Is France on the decline?
Think before acting!
That's easy to say!
It's a plastic spider
I don't want us to get caught
I don't write the rules
I don't play any instrument
Lifeguards go on duty at 9:30
Maybe you're just an idiot
Now really isn't a good time
We gotta haul tits!
People aren't all the same
Of course, Tom was invited
Of course, this is illegal
May I ask your age?
It's difficult to learn Korean
Will they go out tomorrow?
Who cares about bad manners?
Tom is away.
What did you say?
I said that Tom is away.
Tom is loved by everyone.
What did you say?
Tom is loved by everyone.
Where is my father?
I want to learn Latin.
What did you say?
Who said this to you?
Who chose you?
Where is my mother?
Tom killed Mary.
What did you say?
I said Tom killed Mary.
Do we really need her?
Do we really need them?
Do we really need him?
There's no perfect system
There's no need to upgrade
There's no lifeguard on duty
That's what we're here for
That's what we really need
That's not a new complaint
A teacher's job isn't easy
What?
You can't drive yet?
Don't eat!
Mary, why are you crying?
Tom denied being Mary's son
Welcome to the asphalt jungle!
I travel for travel's sake
I'm happy with my salary
I didn't even try to respond
What are you laughing at, Tom?
Am I allowed to go with Tom?
No, thanks
I don't drink beer
Give me a kiss!
I'm not insolent to them
They were wrong, of course
They're better than we are
They're having a hard time
They're taking a long time
They're trying to scare us
What's your favorite fish?
Someday you'll know the truth!
No, not even a little
Get moving!
In that case, I'll call you
Who will swim most quickly?
Who will swim the fastest?
This is very, very unusual
I'd like to return this book
How much is the late fee?
This isn't a private beach
This isn't just about Tom
This isn't what Tom wanted
That's basic economics
That's basic science
That's basic math
Come on, Tom
That's basic math
Which side are you on?
This thing isn't over yet
Show me your new pocket watch!
Your shirt's not tucked in
Everyone's against me!
It totally worked!
Are you nearsighted?
Let's have tea at three
Do you know his email address?
What do they sell?
Tom couldn't play the guitar
He's coming home again
I'm not dictating them
You've been here way too long
You're such a hard worker
You're busy all the time
You'll be very happy here
You can't ignore the risk
Won't you stay for supper?
Where's all the money now?
Who can solve the problem?
Who makes the decisions here?
Why are these people here?
Why are we being punished?
Why was there nobody here?
Why's everything so dark?
Will it make a difference?
What was the real problem?
What exactly was the plan?
We've run out of patience
We've had some tough times
We're still best friends
We're running out of food
We're really proud of Tom
Tom's car is blue
Be quiet!
They're sleeping!
Tom doesn't drink now
Can I borrow one of yours?
Is VAT included in the price?
She can't resist ice cream
How can you be so stupid?
How can one be so stupid?
Is he from Japan?
But can Santa read Japanese?
I've never met Mary
We'll have to be prepared
We'll learn the truth soon
We'll meet at the station
We'll use anything we can
We're all waiting for you
We're having a great time
We're having a tough time
We're in a deep recession
We're not afraid of death
We're not happy with this
We're not really sure yet
We're not worried about it
We're pretty proud of that
We're ready to do that
Hello, boys!
We know where you've been
Did I touch a raw nerve?
Tom's father's name is John
Tom's recovery took a year
Tom's wife is still alive
Wait just a minute, please
Waiting isn't a good idea
It's not just Tom's fault
It's not possible to wait
It's not that windy today
It's not worth it anymore
It's really kind of funny
It's time to move forward
It's time to stop waiting
It's totally worth a shot
Tom's father is a musician
Tom's father is in prison
It's very, very hard work
Just what is Tom's secret?
Mary is Tom's second wife
Maybe that'll be enough
No one knows what's right
Of course, we're prepared
OK, let's make this quick
Tom weighs just 33 pounds
Tom wasn't wearing a shirt
I'm sure that he'll come
It's anybody's guess
He's a dead cert for the job
He can't compare with you
I just can't fathom it
It's my belief that he's lying
It's beyong belief
He's an awful busybody
I didn't mean to be nosy
I'm very disappointed in him
That's a tall order
I'm in two minds about going
I'm getting all mixed up
We're hoping for good weather
Tom says that's not enough
Tom says he's not worried
It must've been someone else
He's quick-witted
Is this real silver?
I don't like public speaking
They've been very nice to me
I'm completely on your side
Tom isn't a rookie anymore
Tom knows we're interested
Tom knows what that's about
Tom said he wasn't happy here
I didn't come here to party
I didn't want to cause a scene
Tom hasn't been there yet
Tom is glad it's all over
Tom is Mary's first cousin
Why is he asking Tom?
Why are you asking Tom?
Thanks, you're an angel
Tom won't be back before 2:30
This isn't the first time
They're lucky to be alive
There's plenty of parking
There's no problem at all
That's unfair competition
That's just not very good
That's a great suggestion
We're in shape
Fun isn't always funny
We're looking for it
You're beginning to worry me
In what area are you experts?
I don't build their cabins
Have you kissed him yet?
Have you kissed her yet?
Are you off your meds?
They're alone over there
I'll take from it what I wish
It's in one piece
Make your bed!
Can I get my money back?

Tom isn't shy, but Mary is
I like Tom's laugh
Tom isn't really in Boston
Tom isn't mad, but Mary is
Tom isn't fun, but Mary is
I drank Tom's beer
Tom isn't fat, but Mary is
Tom isn't as tired as I am
Eat your soup, Tom
Tom isn't as smart as I am
You're lucky, Tom
Tom isn't as short as I am
Why is Tom so sad?
Tom isn't as quick as I am
Who is Tom really?
Tom isn't as picky as I am
We didn't see Tom
Tom isn't as lucky as I am
Tom isn't as drunk as I am
Tom's light is on
Tom isn't as dirty as I am
Tom isn't as crazy as I am
Tom saw Mary, too
Tom isn't as clean as I am
Tom isn't as angry as I am
Tom isn't any good at math
Tom loves me, too
You don't seem very interested
Tom isn't singing
You don't seem to care anymore
Tom is shy, but Mary isn't
You don't really need to worry
You don't need to talk so loud
You don't look like a beginner
You don't know how strong I am
We'll have a meeting on Monday
We have a three-month-old baby
Tom is out, but Mary isn't
We can't finish this by Monday
Tell us what we're doing wrong
Let's go to Boston next summer
It wasn't very easy to do that
It doesn't really matter to me
I've had a very difficult year
I've fallen and I can't get up
I'm very relieved to hear that
I'm the one who wanted to wait
I'm the one who suggested this
I'm the one who suggested that
I'm the one who should do that
I'm the one who made this mess
I'm the one who had to do that
I'm the one who broke the vase
I'm the one who asked for help
I'm reluctant to do that again
Tom is mad, but Mary isn't
I'm much stronger than you are
I'm in love with your daughter
I'm going to do whatever I can
I'm going to do that this fall
I'm going to do that right now
I'm going to do that on my own
I'm going to do that on Monday
I'm going to do that next fall
Tom is in Boston, it seems
I'm going to do that by myself
I'm going to come back at 2:30
I'm going to college next year
I'm going to buy that painting
I'm going to buy a new bicycle
I'm going to be here all night
I'm going to be here all month
I'm glad that I didn't do that
Tom is fun, but Mary isn't
I'm doing this for my children
I'm considering not doing that
I'm certainly going to do that
I'm almost finished doing that
Tom is fat, but Mary isn't
I'll never, ever do that again
I'll have my secretary do that
I'll give you a ride in my car
I'll be waiting at the station
I'll be there just after lunch
I'll be there in just a moment
I'll be ready in just a minute
I'll be hungry when I get home
I'll be here until next Monday
I'll be here next week, I hope
I'd never force you to do that
I'd like to go to Boston again
I'd get arrested if I did that
Tom is dangerous, isn't he?
I should get there before 2:30
Mary isn't
I hope you're as happy as I am
I haven't seen the results yet
I have a cousin who's a doctor
I got to the hotel around 2:30
Is this pen Tom's?
Is this hat Tom's?
Tom hasn't gone to bed yet
I got here a little after 2:30
Is this dog Tom's?
I felt like I've been betrayed
I feel it's my duty to do that

I don't want to see that movie
I don't want to live on my own
I don't want to join your club
I don't want to be an engineer

I don't usually dress this way
Tom grabbed his dog's tail
I don't use salt in my cooking
I don't understand much French
I don't think that will happen
Is this Tom's hat?
I don't think I'll get the job
I don't think I agree with you
I don't speak French every day
I don't really want to eat now
Is this Tom's dog?
I don't often eat meat anymore
I don't often drink white wine
I can't speak French
Tom can't speak French either
I don't need to work on Monday
I don't necessarily have to go
Is that car Tom's?
I don't mind lending you money
I don't like to rely on others
I don't like this kind of food
I don't like the way you dance
Is that Tom's son?
I don't like milk in my coffee
I don't like coffee with sugar
I don't let my dog in my house
I don't know how to play chess

I don't have much energy today
Is that Tom's dog?
I don't have many weekends off
I don't have enough experience
I don't have any place to live
I don't have a savings account
Is Tom busy today?
I don't have a pressure cooker
I don't have a high-paying job
I don't go skin diving anymore
I don't gamble, drink or smoke
I'm divorcing Tom
I don't enjoy horseback riding
Tom doesn't get much sleep
I don't do that very regularly
I don't do that at all anymore
I don't do anything on Mondays
I don't consider myself a hero
Tom doesn't gamble anymore
I didn't think I'd be so tired
I didn't get paid much do that
I didn't do all this by myself
Tom didn't really know why
I can't tie my shoes by myself
I can't think of a better plan
I can't sleep without a pillow
I can't seem to access my data
Tom didn't change anything
I can't remember my PIN number
I can't pay my rent this month
I can't help you do that today
I can't give you an answer yet
I can't give you an answer now
I admit that I've been naughty
You'd better be ready by 2:30
You don't look very confident
You don't look nervous at all
You don't look like a teacher
You don't have to wait for me
Why do women hate you so much?
When did you learn to do that?
What did you have for dessert?
What am I supposed to do next?
We're not waiting for the bus
I'll make Tom go
Nothing bad's going to happen
Luckily, I had a backup plan
Let's go on a picnic together
Let's get the meeting started
It wasn't snowing when I left
It wasn't raining when I left
I'm too tired to help you now
I'm too busy to do that today
I'm the one who mows the lawn
I'm the one who mows our lawn
I'm the one who milks the cow
I'm the one who got beaten up
I'm the one who feeds the dog
I'm the one who feeds our dog
Does Tom love me?
I'm the one who cooked dinner
I'm not sure if I can do that
I'm going to fly to Australia
I'm going to do that sometime
Does Tom hate me?
I'm going to do that for sure
I'm going to camp this summer
I'm going to become a teacher
I'm going to be here tomorrow
I'm going to be here all year
Tom and I aren't that poor
I'm going to be here all week
I'm going to be free tomorrow
I'm going to be busy tomorrow
Call Tom at 2:30
I'm going to be a father soon
Tom and I aren't like that
I'm fairly sure I can do that
I'm fairly good at doing that
I'm able to do that on my own
I'm able to do that by myself
I'll start doing that tonight
I'll never fall in love again
I'll live in Boston next year
I'll go to Boston and Chicago
I'll do that for you for free
I'll do that after I get back
I'll be working all afternoon
I'll be very sad if you leave
I'll be tired when I get home
I'll be there in half an hour
I'll be here till next Monday
I'll be here for several days
I'll be happy if that happens
I'll be arriving an hour late
I won't be at today's meeting
Those aren't Tom's parents
I think I'm going to be fired
This used to be Tom's home
I still don't have to do that
I should be there before 2:30
That's what made Tom happy
How's Tom today?
That's what made Tom angry
I know you don't like me much
I hope you don't get homesick
Please don't call Tom back
Don't touch Tom
My car is newer than Tom's
Are those Tom's?
Luckily, Tom wasn't killed
Let's go swimming with Tom
It wasn't easy to find Tom
I don't yet know why I'm here
I don't want to work tomorrow
I don't want to join the team
I don't want to go to Harvard
I don't want to go for a walk
I'm sorry, Tom
I don't usually drink so much
I'm the one who helped Tom
I don't usually do that alone
I don't think that we can win
I don't think that I did that
I don't think it's impossible
I'm not as broke as Tom is
I don't think I have a choice
I don't take a bath every day
I don't quite see it that way
I don't quite know what to do
I'm not as angry as Tom is
I don't plan on stepping down
I don't often do that at home
I don't need to do that, do I?
I don't mind getting up early
I'll tell Tom all about it
I don't listen to rap anymore
I don't like the way you sing
I don't like the way you cook
Can Tom see me?
I don't like the rainy season
I'll sit wait here for Tom
I don't like tennis very much
I don't like my mother-in-law
I don't like apples very much
I washed Tom's car for him
I don't know where I was born
I don't know much about sheep
I don't know Boston very well
I don't have to work tomorrow
I don't have to do that, do I?
I don't have much of a choice
I don't have expensive tastes
I don't have any real friends
I don't have any friends here
I don't have a microwave oven
I don't have a lot of friends
Is Tom in bed?
I don't go fishing very often
I don't enjoy giving speeches
I didn't get the job I wanted
I can't very well do that now
I can't take on any more work
I can't see myself doing that
I can't go to Boston with you
This computer isn't Tom's
It's mine
I can't go out with you today
I can't finish this job today
I can't do that all by myself
I can't come to work tomorrow
I can't afford all this stuff
Does Tom work?
Goodbye, Tom
Bye, Tom
I admitted I'd made a mistake
I told Tom he shouldn't go
You'll be sorry you did that
You'll be happy you did that
You'd better watch your back
You need to be ready by 2:30
I tied Tom's shoes for him
You look like you're unhappy
You don't seem too concerned
You don't seem to be nervous
You don't look too convinced
You don't help me very often
You didn't eat that, did you?
Will you go to Boston by bus?
Where did you go last Monday?
What did you eat for dessert?
This didn't cost me anything
I parked Tom's car for him
Tell me what I'm doing wrong
I mowed Tom's lawn for him
Let's get something to drink
Is this store open on Monday?
If you need my help, call me
I've been tempted to do that
I'm the one who planned this
I'm the one who did all this
I'm going to quit doing that
I'm going to miss doing this
I'm going to miss doing that
I'm going to let you do that
I'm going to get better soon
I'm going to be leaving soon
I'm going to be home tonight
I'm going to be home by 2:30
I'm going to be here tonight
I'm going to be here all day
I'm going to be gone all day
I'm going to be an architect
I'm expecting that to happen
I'm expected to do that, too
I'm beginning to feel hungry
I'm also expected to do that
I'm afraid to try doing that
I'll play the guitar for you
I'll pick you up around 2:30
I'll eat this if you do, too
I'll be there this afternoon
I'll be there in three hours
I'll be there for a few days
I'll be the person in charge
I'll be really busy, won't I?
I'll be here only a few days
I'll be here for three weeks
I'll be getting married soon
I'd be too scared to do that
I won't be there before 2:30
I'm not all that busy nowadays
I haven't gotten my visa yet
I don't want Tom's old job
I have a son who's in prison
Tom isn't stupid
He's just lazy
I don't think Tom was late
I don't think Tom was hurt
I don't think Tom was home
I got to the station at 2:30

I don't even want it anymore
I don't come here that often
I don't think Tom is bossy
I can't understand this poem
I can't tie my own shoes yet
I can't teach French anymore
I can't take credit for that
I don't think Tom is alive
I can't speak French, either
I can't play piano very well
I can't go to Boston, either
I can't give this to you yet
I don't see Tom very often
I can't give this to you now
I can't get this window open
I can't get this bottle open
I can't do the job by myself
I don't see Tom that often
I don't care, but Tom does
I agreed to be there by 2:30
Don't do that while I'm here
I can't help Tom right now
Can we go hiking next Monday?
Can I get you some breakfast?
You'll be safe here with us
I can't get Tom to kiss me
You'll be safe here with me
You'll be glad you did that
You don't seem very excited

You don't seem to be afraid
You don't seem much happier
You don't look very relaxed
Have Tom and I done enough?
You don't look very healthy
You don't have to leave yet
You can't have a cookie now
Does Tom speak French, too?
Why are you holding a knife?
What time will you get home?
What time will you get here?
What else will you be doing?
Does Tom have enough money?
That movie wasn't very good
Does Tom have any children?
Let's stay here for a while
Is that blood on your shoes?
I, too, have been to Boston
Can Tom get tickets for us?
I'm too busy to do that now
I'm really happy to see you
I'm not old enough to drink
I'm irritated by that noise
Are those Tom's sunglasses?
I'm going to try to do that
I'm going to try doing that
I'm going to drive you home
I'm going to come home soon
Are these sunglasses Tom's?
I'm going to come back soon
I'm going to buy a used car
I'm going to be there today
I'm going to be an engineer
I'm going to always be here
I'm getting better at chess
I'm being forced to do that
I'm beginning to feel tired
I'm an expert at doing that

I'm almost ready to do that
I'm able to do that as well
I'll visit Boston next week
I'll teach you how to skate
I'll start dieting tomorrow

I'll be thirteen in October
I'll be staying for a while
I'll be ready to leave soon
I'll be here this afternoon
I'll be here for three days
I'll be here for a few days
I'd get fired if I did that
I won't be home next Monday
I wasn't all that surprised
I haven't broken my promise
I have a son who's a doctor
Tom wasn't last
Tom stole Mary's umbrella
Tom stole Mary's passport
I got home just before 2:30
I got here just before 2:30
I got back home before 2:30
I don't yet know what to do
I don't want to sell my car
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to go home yet
I don't want to go by train
I don't want to change that
I don't want to be like you
I don't want to be a doctor
I don't usually wear makeup
I don't think you'd do that
I don't think it's possible
I don't really like oysters
I don't really get out much
I don't play guitar anymore
I don't often get depressed
I don't often do that alone
I don't live near my office

I don't know who stabbed me
I don't have much free time
I don't enjoy watching golf

I can't get my car to start
I can't eat food this spicy
I can't comment on that now
I can't be so easily fooled
I admitted I didn't do that
I admit that I've done that
Either I'm right or you are
You don't seem to be happy
You don't seem to be drunk
You don't look tired to me
You don't look that strong
You don't look happy to me
Please don't be late again
I'm the one who left early
I'm the one who called 911
I'm not having a good time
I'm not going to die, am I?
I'm going to try to escape
I'm going to figure it out
I'm going to do that today
I'm going to do that later
I'm going to do that alone
I'm going to call the cops
I'm going to be late again
I'm busy and can't do that
I'm at the top of my class
I'm about ready to do that
I'll help as much as I can
I'll get up early tomorrow
Tom recognized Mary's dog
I'll call you this evening
I'll be thirteen next year
I'll be there this evening
I'll be lonely without you
I'll be here all day today
I'll be busy tomorrow, too
I'll be back in a few days
I'll be at today's meeting
I won't sign this contract
I think I've been betrayed
I still don't know how to swim
I hope I don't get nervous
I got home at exactly 2:30
I got here just after 2:30
Tom isn't up, but Mary is
I don't yet know the truth

I don't want to go hunting
Tom isn't really sleeping
I don't use a cane anymore

I don't fit in here at all
Tom isn't from a big city
I don't ever walk anywhere
I don't eat rice every day
I don't drink beer at home

Tom isn't as ugly as Mary
I didn't say anything else
I didn't get enough to eat
I can't survive here alone
I can't meet you on Monday
Tom isn't as thin as I am
I can't get this door open
I can't decide where to go
I can't decide what to buy
Tom isn't as slow as I am
I can't come to work today
Tom isn't as sick as I am
Don't go there by yourself
Tom isn't as rich as I am
You have to buy this, too
You don't seem to be busy
Tom isn't as poor as I am
You don't seem interested
Would you help me do this?
Let's play a different game
Tom isn't as neat as I am
Is the zoo open on Monday?
I'm very happy I did that
I'm the one who does that
Tom isn't as busy as I am
I'm not carrying a weapon
I'm going to get divorced
I'm going to do that, too
I'm going to do that soon
Tom isn't as bald as I am
I'm going to deal with it
I'm going to come get you
I'm going to come by taxi
I'm going to be just fine
Tom isn't OK, but Mary is
I'm going to be in charge
I'm going to be home soon
I'm going to be done soon
I'm going to be back soon

I'll be here this evening
I'll be back this evening
I'll be back around 2:30
I wish you'd quit whining
I wasn't able to fix that
Tom is up, but Mary isn't
I think that's a bad idea
I have a driver's license
I had hip surgery in 2013
I got up at 6:30 as usual
Tom is in, but Mary isn't
I feel it's my duty to go
I don't want your old job
I don't want to move here
I don't want to go abroad
I don't want to get a dog
I don't want to eat pizza
I don't want a girlfriend
I don't think you can win

I can't live here anymore
I can't let you leave yet
I can't handle this alone
I can't go with you today
I can't find a decent job
I can't do without my car
Tom is OK, but Mary isn't
How disappointed were you?
Are you busy Monday night?
Tom is Canadian, isn't he?
Are these magazines yours?
You don't seem surprised
You don't look old to me
You don't look impressed
You don't look convinced
Will you help me do this?
What do you do on Monday?
There's still work to do
That's the way I want it
Let's stay until the end
I've agreed to come back
I'm the one who did this
I'm going to college now
I'm going to change that
I'm going to beat you up
I'm able to do that, too
I'll try again next week
I'll stay here till 2:30
I'll stay here all month
I'll see you next Monday
I'll do that later today
I'll do that after lunch
I'll buy the cheaper one
I'll be thirty next year
I'll be on duty tomorrow
I'll be home by midnight
I'll be here three weeks
I'll be here all evening
I'll be back later today
I'd be scared to do that
I won't buy that for you
I won't be able to fix that
I usually get up at 6:30
I hope I didn't bore you
I got it wrong, didn't I?
I got here at about 2:30
I don't want to sit down
I don't want to be found
I don't want to be first
I don't want to be fired
I don't think you'll win
I don't think we can win
Tom doesn't usually snore

I don't think I did that
I don't smoke cigarettes
I don't see it like that
Tom didn't steal anything
I don't plan to be there
I don't often drink beer
I don't need to go there
I don't need to be there
Tom didn't show up at all
I don't mind getting wet
I don't live near where I work
I don't like to be early
I don't like tennis much
Tom didn't drink anything
I don't like sports much
I don't know who shot me
I don't know much either
I don't have what I need
Tom couldn't pay his rent
I don't have the tickets
I don't do that that way
I don't believe I'll win
Tom couldn't contact Mary
I can't wait to graduate
I can't tie my shoelaces
I can't tie my own shoes
I can't stand loud music
Tom can't go to the dance
I can't speak any French
I can't seem to ever win
I can't buy that for you
I can't believe our luck
I admit I didn't do that
Does this look OK to you?
Did your interview go OK?
You'll feel better soon
You don't seem to agree
You don't look too sure
You don't look thrilled
Let's go out for dinner
I'm going to get better
I'm going to come later
I'm going to come early
I'm expected to do that
I'm able to do that now
I'll take both of these
I'll stay until the end
I'll help you all I can
I'll graduate next year
I'll give you this book
I'll be working tonight
I'll be there very soon
I'll be here until noon
I'll be back home soon
I'd prefer to go by car
I won't try to stop you
I won't allow you to go
Tom and I aren't sleeping
Tom and I aren't prepared
Tom and I aren't done yet
Tom and I aren't dead yet
Tom and I aren't children
I don't wish to do that
I don't think we'll win
I don't sing very often
I don't plan to give up
I don't love my husband
I don't like smoky bars
I don't like salty food
I don't like my new job
I don't like being here
I don't know how to ski
I don't have a visa yet
I don't have a basement
I don't get this at all
I don't carry much cash
I can't stand punk rock
I can't really help you
I can't make it tonight
I can't find a good job
I can't believe my luck
These books are all Tom's
Do you have Mondays off?
That isn't what Tom wants
Are they open on Monday?
You'll be missed a lot
You don't seem to care
You don't look pleased
You don't look nervous
What's in that package?
It's time to start now
Let's let Tom handle that
I've just eaten dinner
I've agreed to do that
I'm so glad I did that
Let's go fishing with Tom
I'm happy you did that
I'm good at doing that
I'm going to be a cook
I'm going to bat third
Isn't that Tom's umbrella?
I'm doing that already
I'm anxious to do that
I'm already doing that
I'm allowed to do that
Isn't that Tom's daughter?
I'm a little bit scared
I'll wash my car today
I'll leave when you do
I'll be here till 2:30
I've agreed to let Tom go
I'll be here on Monday
I'll be here next week
I wish I could go, too
I'm not as fast as Tom is
I was bored, so I left
I'm not so busy nowadays
I'm going to buy Tom that
I have to do that, too
I waxed Tom's car for him
I got home around 2:30
I don't want to try it
I don't think I'll win
I don't own a computer
I don't like green tea
I don't know who's who
I don't have seniority
I don't have a husband
I don't give up easily
I don't eat much fruit
I don't do that at all
I don't care who comes
I can't play the flute
I can't leave just yet
I admit I wasn't happy
Do you have Monday off?
Are you open on Monday?
Are you free on Monday?
Are these your glasses?
You don't seem hungry
You don't need to pay
You don't look scared
We'll really miss you
Let's go out and play
I don't trust Tom one bit
I've just eaten lunch
I'm going to fix this
I'm going to fix that
I'm going to be alone
I don't think Tom was shy
I'm bad at doing that
I'll go there for you
I'll be there as well
I'll be free tomorrow
I don't think Tom was mad
I still don't do that
I don't think Tom is weak
I have a step-brother
I don't think Tom is safe
I have a half-brother
I don't think Tom is nuts
I had to do that, too
I don't think Tom is next
I got home about 2:30
I don't think Tom is mean
I don't think Tom is lost
I don't want to argue
I don't think Tom is hurt
I don't often do this
I don't like shopping
I don't have red hair
I don't have freckles
I don't think Tom is high
I don't have any cats
I don't do that a lot
I don't carry a purse
I don't think Tom is free
I don't think Tom is cool
I admit I wasn't sure
How about next Monday?
Are these your gloves?
I don't think Tom is back
Who drove here today?
Let's go on a picnic
I've had a rough day
I don't know why Tom left
I've agreed to leave
I'm going to be busy
I'm going to a party
I'll wait for a week
I'll try to be early
I'll go if I have to
I'll gladly help you
I'll be needing this
I can't seem to avoid Tom
I'll be married soon
I'll be leaving soon
I'll be here tonight
I'll be gone all day
I can't go to Tom's party
I'd almost forgotten
I have a step-sister
How good a swimmer is Tom?
How good a drummer is Tom?
Does Tom have a snowboard?
I don't want to walk
I don't want to move
Could you please help Tom?
I don't love my wife
I don't like popcorn
I don't like jogging
I don't like driving
You told Tom, didn't you?
I don't know who won
I don't have a beard
I don't do that here
I don't care who won
Why are Tom and you here?
I can't tie my shoes
I can't go on Monday
Tom's hobby is astronomy
How are noodles made?
Which coat is yours?
Let's play together
I'm the one who won
Tom's door wasn't locked
I'm going to escape
I'll lend you a pen
I'll be OK, won't I?
Tom's bicycle was stolen
I'm not busy nowadays
I hope I'm not next
I don't wear makeup
I don't play soccer
I don't own a house
I don't like to fly
I don't have it now
I don't have a visa
I don't fit in here
Tom went to Mary's party
I don't eat dessert

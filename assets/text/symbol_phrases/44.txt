When will you be ready?
Are those Tom's classmates?
We don't have enough yet
What did they give you?
It's not a good look
What's on the list?
Fold the towels, please
Have you told me the truth?
Lions aren't afraid of fire
Did you bring everything?
We love you, Tom
We're euphoric
Cheer up!
I'm going to the bakery now
Do you want anything?
Is that really money?
They're far away
Are these your passports?
Does your dog have fleas?
How many miles did Tom run?
We're all doing well
Have your plans changed?
Where did Tom leave the keys?
When will they do that?
Would you please drive?
We're quite similar
Will Tom accept our proposal?
Correct.
You're a keener, Ragnar!
You're a keener, Ragnar!
You're a keener, Ragnar!
Who else here is a vegetarian?
It's marvellous!
I bet, Ragnar.
I bet, Ragnar.
Which way did they go?
We still haven't found Tom
Please don't smoke here
Where are the geese?
You won't find Tom at home
Summer isn't over yet
Malka's fursona is a cat
Is that a man or a woman?
Do you feel unwell?
We're psychologists
Who wants to help us?
They're thirsty
He's at a conference
Could you do this for me?
I'll die of hunger!
Why are flights so expensive?
Stay with us!
Can't Tom come with us?
That folder is heavy!
What's in it?
How old is your school?
A light is on in Tom's window
Tom wasn't at home that night
Is everything OK, guys?
Where did you get this one?
Tom's a sexy man
We don't expect much from Tom
There's a bear outside
Well, it serves you right
What's tormenting you?
I'm a cute kid, right?
You could've just told him
You could've just told her
You could've just told them
Sweat beaded on Tom's forehead
Where does the bus stop?
Let's go there soon
Who else came to your party?
Don't be bad
Could you stay with me?
Where were you looking for?
Do you have Tom's work number?
Tomorrow won't be cloudy
Who told you I was here?
Yes, thanks
Yes, thank you
It wasn't a serious request
It isn't a serious request
It's not a serious request
It's almost new
They're almost new
What caused the fight?
What did you think about Tom?
Tom's charm is undeniable
Can you give us a signal?
Women aren't like that
Don't you like your name?
Where have you traveled?
Will you call tomorrow?
Who taught you how to paint?
Did you practice yesterday?
I'll speak to Tom immediately
Who'll buy it?
You've added too much pepper
Don't get distracted
What you want from me?
Tom doesn't need to know this
That's worse
Who'll fix these mistakes?
When does this course end?
We'll get to do that soon
When are we going there?
How much do we owe, Tom?
Tom didn't have time to hide
Can I count on you today?
Don't cross your legs
Is that what they said?
We're somewhat similar to Tom
Tom won't be there on time
What else do you buy?
Do all Canadians speak French?
Do all Canadians know French?
I'd never have thought of that
Tom didn't like the new app
It's cold and wintry
It's light enough
It's bright enough
There you are at last!
What does your T-shirt say?
How is the mother-to-be?
How's the mum-to-be?
Don't throw that bottle away
Don't throw that bottle away
We're a bit short of money now
He's not easily pleased
He isn't easily pleased
It's not guaranteed
Please don't push
How do you know that?
Can you read minds?
Can it be put more simply?
Can it be put simpler?
Will tomorrow be dry?
Will tomorrow be a dry day?
Will it be dry tomorrow?
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
Is tomorrow going to be dry?
It's too many at once
It's too much all at once
She's in her seventh month
She's seven months pregnant
I'll be with you in a tick
I'll be there in a second
My shoelace's snapped
I'll be there in a sec
I'll be there in a minute
Can't you say it in Asturian?
You're going slowly
You're walking slowly
You know Tom shouldn't drink
But you've changed.
Write it down.
I'll remember it.
I'm sitting there.
And where am I sitting?
Over there in the corner.
I'm sitting there.
And where am I sitting?
Over there in the corner.
Have you wrapped everything?
Did you like how Tom sang?
Did you like Tom's singing?
Here's my favourite place
Whose hand is she holding?
It's not an easy thing
It's a tricky case
Why are they not here?
I didn't know the way
Am I bothering you?
You?
Never.
She's in her fourth month
She's four months pregnant
Tom's got a very good memory
You've got three seconds
Didn't you want to get up?
That's right
I didn't want to get up!
We're tailors
What did you put there?
Can you give me a tissue?
Do you have it in green?
When did Tom start stuttering?
Don't argue with them
Sit down and don't move
What's on our agenda?
Does Tom have to do this now?
Why's the door unlocked?
This book is mine, not Tom's
We've never denied that
Tom wasn't involved in this
Who sponsored the race?
Wait, we'll go with you
Tom's left sleeve is torn
Well, what's the news?
Who invented the typewriter?
You shouldn't have told Tom
I'm sorry that Tom didn't come
Are you going home soon?
What did Tom borrow from you?
Let's take the next bus
Why should we suffer?
Why are you listening to Tom?
Why are you listening to him?
Why are you listening to her?
Why are you listening to them?
Who lived here before you?
I'm afraid Tom doesn't like me
Were you in my room?
Did Tom sound depressed?
Is that your neighbor?
Now?
No, not yet.
How about now?
Who was sitting where?
My ears aren't pierced
I don't believe in hypnosis
Tom's voice cracked slightly
You've got to believe us
You've got to believe in me
We're very attached to Tom
You didn't say it like this
It's cold in the attic
Tom isn't as lucky as Mary is
Tom's a very likeable guy
Can you stop this?
What did he want them to do?
It's almost eleven
How is he?
It's not the end of the world!
I'm ashamed of being alive
Tom didn't like it very much
Is everything OK now?
Will that girl come again?
I love that Tom isn't greedy
I'm connected 24 hours a day
Bring Tom here now!
Did they arrive?
We'll go there by bike
There's somebody in your room
From now on, be more careful
Dad, I saw an elf!
Is Tom the one with the beard?
Is he the one with the beard?
Tell us how it happened, Tom
That's one of Tom's triggers
Can cats have sweet potato?
What's Area 51?
What is Area 51?
Why do cats knead?
How long does Tom still have?
Now it doesn't matter
I bought my first car in 1998
Please don't complain
It's heavier than it looks
It's lighter than it looks
Come on, guys
It's very dangerous here
We would've left Tom alone
If you agree, sign here
I'll be at the meeting
I'll be bald soon
I'll be doing my homework
I'll be free in ten minutes
I'll be here until you return
I'll be thirteen next week
Tom didn't want to go away
I'm trying to get some rest
It's not hot there
You'll be well compensated
We'll compensate you well
Does anybody need my help?
Sheela, like a passing parade?
Sort of.
Oh, okay, Sheela.
I'll try, Sheela.
Come at once!
There's almost no wine left
There's hardly any wine left
There's not much wine left
There's nobody in the park
The meeting lasted until 2:30
The meeting went until 2:30
Tom doesn't meditate
There's an album on the desk
There's nothing to add
Which place do you prefer?
Why do women like gifts?
Tom's clothes smell like smoke
It's not done in a hour
Should I be completely honest?
What do you mean by "talent"?
Look, here is my bike
Well, make up your mind
Forgive me!
Good, then I will talk
Don't humiliate yourself
Tell us a joke!
It's not new anymore
Where would you prefer to sit?
Tom's dog needs to get out
My grandmother's hair is white
Can't you wait a bit?
I didn’t want any more rice
That won't be hard for us
Why is Algeria so important?
Algeria isn't a small country
What are Algeria's strengths?
Who doesn't love Algeria?
I love Algeria.
Who doesn't love Algeria?
Algeria, always Algeria!
That one isn't for sale
Ethiopian.
We'll take the next bus
Tom's behavior was peculiar
You'll be my co-workers
What can he do?
What can she do?
Don't press that button
It's time to calm down
How long did you talk to Tom?
Is Algeria still a democracy?
We weren't told either
What day were you born?
Let's make one last effort
Easy for you to say!
Maybe we'll meet there
Tom wasn't quite up to speed
I haven't lost much weight
We haven't seen Tom recently
We won't be fooled
I don't follow politics
It wasn't properly tested
Why should anyone trust it?
I don't think Tom can qualify
First, he visited Italy
Look how the Magyars have fun!
Who's talking to them?
What is a nurse?
We don't pay very much
That won't fix it
When did Tom discover this?
Tom isn't meditating
Tom's face was expressionless
We didn't see anyone
I sit on a bench.
That won't be easy for us
They're natural
You can't compare them
I haven't seen Tom around here
What time is it in London?
Where is my refund?
Tom is kind of tall, isn't he?
It's an academic question
Did Tom spend a lot of money?
We're going to the zoo
It's a fairy tale
Oh, Sam, you're a keener!
Okay, Sam.
I didn't write everything down
At night, we use candlelight.
What a romantic setting, Sam!
I've seen Tom fairly recently
It'll be even colder tomorrow
You're now my prisoner
Maybe it's for the best
I'm already bald
That won't be difficult for us
Is her name Anna?
I'm delighted to find you here
What did we do to upset Tom?
We're facing many difficulties
Tom threw a pie on Mary's face
There's no denying it
Tom leaned on Mary's shoulder
Let's never fight again
Surprisingly, it worked
It's a book on health
She's here
Well, it's my own fault
I'm not expecting Tom's help
There's no more water
Have you seen Tom around?
I'm looking for him
I don't care when you get here
Waking up so early isn't good
Tom's eyes widened in fear
We've made a big mistake
How old is Donald Trump?
How old is Joe Biden?
What is a verb?
What's a verb?
Can dogs eat bananas?
Can cats eat bananas?
Why can't dogs eat chocolate?
We're on our way there
That isn't a problem
That hasn't been proven
I'm not at all like you
There's no such place
I thought I'd find Tom there
This is what you'll do
I'm sorry Tom didn't come
Tom's left sleeve was torn
We don't have much water
We're very different from Tom
Isn't anybody there?
We must've been wrong
Does anybody know?
Nobody knows about this?
Does anyone know about this?
What kind of car does Tom own?
Why is Mary still virgin?
Why is Mary still a virgin?
Which DAW does Tom work with?
We don't go anywhere anymore
That's it
I know my rights!
You have the right to shut up.
Tom's life is in Mary's hands
Don't tease Tom too much
He's pretty sensitive
Tom doesn't believe in karma
Tom took three weeks' vacation
Yikes!
We're pretty busy people
Amazing!
Yeah.
What's he like?
Interesting!
How's he doing?
Is he doing OK?
Don't swear at the guests
None of Tom's clothes fit me
You're the one whining, not us
It sounds interesting!
Make sure Tom doesn't run away
Take my things.
Keep them.
But I want you to have them.
Don't go near the border
I thought you were Hispanic.
No, I'm a Métis.
I thought you were Japanese.
No, I'm a Mexican.
I thought you were Japanese.
No, I'm from Nunavut.
I thought you were Japanese.
No, I'm from Uruguay.
Let's go to the castle
Our help won't be needed
What did Tom go there to do?
Does this often happen to Tom?
It wasn't our choice
Just don't tell Tom anything
Tom should've been elected
I'm fond of the Osaka dialect
Is oil a curse in Algeria?
Tom didn't tell me about this
It'll cost some 10,000 yen
I should've eaten before Tom
We're waiting for lunch
Only Tom, himself, knows that
Has Tom completed his degree?
We're a bit hungry
They're adults
There's no more juice
Don't lick your fingers
We're electricians
Find out what's in there
Tom doesn't usually talk to me
We should've gone with Tom
If you want help, just ask
Wait!
What are you doing there?
Where is Beirut?
Where's Beirut?
Where is Lebanon?
Where's Lebanon?
Is there anything Tom can do?
We're fellow countrymen
Tom still hasn't reimbursed me
What was here on the table?
You can't let Tom go alone
Tom will decide, not you
We're third graders
Let's get off the train
Who did Tom hurt?
Who did harm to Tom?
She's Bulgarian
She's a Bulgarian Jew
Who invited Tom here?
Who did Tom invite here?
Please don't leave Tom alone
He's Bulgarian
He's a Bulgarian Jew
Which subway goes downtown?
Tom isn't sure he wants to
That isn't the solution
That could've gone pear-shaped
That could've ended badly
Maybe I'm better than you
We haven't got a tumble dryer
What a strange slogan!
Are you sure Tom winked at me?
That isn't so important
By train.
Whose round is it?
I'm skint
I'm brassic
Tom, like me, is an artist
Can you lend the book to me?
Can you lend me that book?
Can you lend me the book?
Mary saved Tom's life
Children aren't safe here
Tom's shutting the door
I choose you.
Why me?
Where should I look for it?
She's brave
She's courageous
She's hungry for knowledge
She's eager for knowledge
Tom's eating strawberries
Tom's eating raspberries
Tom's got an upset stomach
It's still adverts
It's still commercials
What a great company!
How's Tom's French?
Pretty good.
Do you have a room?
Why?
Why?
Tom's confession was shocking
We want Tom's help
Who locked this door?
Let's start right now
Why did you open the windows?
Who opened the windows?
It'll be windy tomorrow
This wasn't my idea
It was Tom's
Tom wasn't particularly shy
Be quiet, please
Suicide isn't the answer
But I just had some tacos!
Why do you live with Tom?
You're faster than me
Tom doesn't know how to park
Let's get there first
You're always like this
We've lost this war
Why did Tom take the stand?
Shirley, it's life insurance
Glen, you aim high!
You have patience, Glen.
Miraculous, Glen.
If Tom wants to go, let him
Tom's compassion surprised us
They walk backwards, unlike us
What does Tom want from you?
It's hard to talk
It's hard to speak
Why isn't Tom there?
The fight wasn't fair
Tom's behavior was strange
I've never tried this
Why didn't Tom come today?
Do you know Tom's intentions?
What a beautiful gift!
I'm glad Tom isn't there
You should've asked me first
What do you expect from Tom?
Don't stay on our account
We're pretty tight on time
Tom wasn't dancing with Mary
We both got A's on the test
There's evidence of foul play
Tom wasn't honest with us
You'll have to eat it
Algeria's cities are growing
Algeria isn't perfect.
Come to Algeria.
Come to Algeria.
Do it in Algeria instead.
We'll rent this house
Your trap didn't work
Where is Algeria?
Where's Algeria?
Where is Kabylia?
Where's Kabylia?
One day we'll know
The problem isn't new
What do you wish to drink?
Do you wish to drink water?
Is Algeria ready for take-off?
I'm thinking about Algeria
We're on the way
Algeria isn't afraid of Israel
Who exactly is Yanni?
Tom didn't kiss Mary goodbye
It's a sliding door
Algerians aren't easily scared
Want my advice?
Algeria, Algeria, Algeria..
Algeria, Algeria, Algeria..
Tom's arrest wasn't unexpected
Look after Tom while I'm gone
I've always loved elephants
There's no such city
Tom isn't sure what he's doing
What a smart baby!
It's just easier to stay home
Let's not go anywhere
I told Tom I'd be there
What does Tom want from Mary?
We've gotten many offers
There's a crack in this bowl
There's someone in your room
Are you from Holland?
I haven't made the salad yet
Should I give Tom something?
That won't fool anyone
Tom's cat is a tabby
Tom doesn't know how to skate
Nobody can resist Tom's charm
Come on, give it some welly!
She's buying food
She's buying some food
My grandfather is 90 years old
My grandad is 90 years old
I'll leave you to it, then.
Stay if you want," said Tom
Tom's an electronics engineer
Mary's got a lemon-yellow hat
Mary has a lemon-yellow hat
Mary's repainted the house
Have you ever talked to Tom?
How do you find that teacher?
How many days was Tom ill?
How many days was Tom ill for?
That isn't recommended
It's of great significance
It's of great importance
It's very significant
That's very significant
I'll wait for you to get back
He's not his son
That's doctor's orders
Can you check that, please?
Can you check it, please?
Can you look it over, please?
She's knitting a hat
We're setting off at daybreak
We'll set off at daybreak
We'll be off at daybreak
We're riding at sunrise

We'll set off first thing
We'll set off at first light
We're setting off first thing
We'll be off first thing
We'll be off at first light
We're off first thing
We're off at first light
It's about time we started
Who directed that film?
I'm eating a big blue fish
It won't cost that much
Do you watch a lot of telly?
Do you watch much television?
I'll cancel the newsletter
Can you shut the door, please?
What shall we cook today?
She's a physiotherapist
She's a physio
He's a physiotherapist
He's a physio

She's a Nobel Prize winner
Where did she learn Danish?
He's a Nobel Prize winner
What time does our train go?
When does our train leave?
He painted a self-portrait
He's painted a self-portrait
I want to talk to Tom, not you
That's how things stand
That's how things are
He's always witty and eloquent
That's an emergency!
What's your favourite joke?
They're talking in the kitchen
All change, please!
Ah, well, that's my secret!
Ah, well, that's my secret!
The train's early
A single to Newcastle, please
Two singles to Bristol, please
A return to York, please
Have you got any change?
Why did Tom drink your beer?
I hope it'll be a warm summer
I can't be bothered to go
I don't fancy going
I don't feel like going
Let's cook something
I'm turning in early today
We're twenty minutes away
We said we'd be discreet
Mary's hair is very beautiful
You'll thank me eventually
Tom didn't enjoy Australia
It's good that Tom left
That's always the case
Tom doesn't drink juice
Don't stay silent
Have you been to Tom's house?
Tom, unlike Mary, can swim
Are we going to play?
I'll cut it with a knife
I'll ride a plane
Did Tom sound interested?
Tom's attitude is commendable
What a strange outfit!
It's really hot, isn't it?
You're a really sweet person
You're always very kind
Tom wasn't in the best spirits
It's burning
We're normal guys
We'll get by
We're shopkeepers
Tom's acting is just awful
Well, that's your right
There's no more orange juice
He'll never change his mind
Tom can bench press 130 pounds
Tom's French is a little rusty
What's the club about?
When do you meet?
Can anyone join?
Tom's face suddenly hardened
Well, it's your own fault
Let's race
You're faster than I am
When were you at Tom's house?
Where do you live?
How about you?
Canada.
Isn't anyone there?
Should I say "he" or "she"?
That's flammable
I'm older than I used to be
Oh!
That's enormous
What a strange question!
Can you keep him company?
How many points did Tom score?
Is Tom American?
No, he's Canadian.
Could you go with him?
Have you ever visited France?
Mary wouldn't dare tell me
This book isn't mine
It's my brother's
I don't feel it
Have you been to France?
That's why Tom came here
I'm a user of that app too
Thanks, as always
Thank you, as always
How could Tom be such a fool?
It's so hot!
I don't think you're a jinx
Jinx!
He's painting the door now
Tom's audition didn't go well
Don't act like a baby!
Doesn't Tom drive you crazy?
We weren't asked to do this
Do as you've been told
I'm an independent journalist
She's special
I don't expect much from Tom
You like her a lot, don't you?
Oh wow, it's already Friday
I admire what you've done
Leave and don't come back
Yanni was well-spoken
Get out of my house.
Are you serious?
Get out of my house.
Who's that girl?
Calm down.
Stop telling me to calm down!
Go inside the house.
Why?
I don't want you in my house.
Are you serious?
I have a girlfriend.
Is she beautiful?
How old is she?
Where are you headed?
Family matters.
Yanni's OK isn't OK
Yanni's yes isn't yes
Hello!
Yeah, who's this?
It's Skura..
Yanni?
Yeah.
Dad has just passed away.
Yanni knows Skura's real name
Yanni didn't know what to do
It's now too late to do that
I love you, my spider
You weren't very tactful
Please don't close the door
What is this stork doing?
What an original idea!
The girls weren't timid
We're yoga teachers
Let's go to her
I'd like to sleep more
Did you receive everything?
I've rested enough already
It's an old manuscript
She can't confront the truth
What a detestable woman!
Where did you last see Tom?
I don't even know who Tom is
Tom, is this a good present?
Do you like this present, Tom?
Don't forget to pay your taxes
It's now my turn to laugh
We've already talked with Tom
Don't let Tom go alone
And the man?
He was colorblind!
Is it Tom's birthday tomorrow?
Is this black bag yours?
Did you like Van?
The fabric's color is blue
That's a very sad situation
He has painted a self-portrait
Who directed this film?
That wouldn't be a smart move
Tom's face remained unreadable
When are we booked for?
What time have we booked?
What time are we booked for?
The sky's become brighter
The sky's got brighter
The sky's brightened up
Tom thought you were doing it!
Is that your pen?
Is that your biro?
Is that your ballpoint?
Are you seeing Tom tomorrow?
Tom should've known that
I've got a map
I hope Tom doesn't forget me
And that's what comes of it
And that's the result
You're going to feel cold
You're going to be cold
You'll be cold
Mrs Smith lives at No.5
Ms Smith lives at No.5
Mrs Schmidt lives at No.5
Ms Schmidt lives at No.5
Tom couldn't reply
Tom wasn't able to answer
Tom wasn't able to reply
Have you got one in blue?
Do you have one in blue?
Don't wait for me!
Go!
There's a bed in every room
Where's the hotel reception?
Explain it to me, please
You don't have to wait
You haven't got to wait
What'll it be?
What will it be?
I'm already awake
Do you use contact lenses?
I'll be a student in September
The kids are at Nan's
The kids are at Granny's
The kids are at their nan's
What's for afters today?
Grandad wanted it.
What a funny story!
What's for dessert today?
It's what grandad wanted.
It's a delicate matter
I saw you together yesterday!
Alice!
Tom replied, laughing
That's all
What do you mean?
Are you two...?
You know.
No, I don't know.
Yeah, we are... sort of.
What do you mean, 'sort of'?
Maybe he can't forget her
She's taller than her sister
It's been happening for days
I've missed it
I've left my glasses at home
I've left my specs at home
Come back early, William.
Yes, Mum.
Come back soon, William.
Yes, Mum.
Don't be out long, William.
Yes, Mum.
It's Tom you want to see
It's been ages since I saw you
What sort of wood is that?
It's oak.
What kind of wood is that?
It's oak.
I haven't seen her anywhere
Shall we go for a drink?
Shall we go for a pint?
Yes, many thanks.
This beer's good
This beer's all right
That beer's good
Do you wear contact lenses?
What are you singing?
What're you singing?
What's that you're singing?
They're careful
What did he come for?
Let's meet in a week
That's beyond doubt
Steve, I think I understand.
Steve, people should know.
Why do you want to stop Tom?
Don't swear at customers
Can you introduce me to Tom?
I'd foreseen that happening
We didn't see them
It wasn't a very exciting game
It's cold in the basement
Mary is a red-haired girl
It's a brand-new product
Tom's essay was full of typos
Were you trying to trick me?
We're being spied on
You won't fool anyone
I don't need these anymore
I'll talk to Tom today
There aren't any foxes here
That's an awesome dress
Tom isn't as lucky as Mary
Tom doesn't stammer anymore
We're not going to eat here
We're not going to eat today
Where's the plunger?
When did Tom start crawling?
Tom obviously couldn't do it
It's OK
You're safe now
Don't worry
You're safe now
You're safe now
It's correct now
It still isn't correct
I wasn't selected
It's done like this
I'm going to shoot
It isn't a real mansion
Tom's fate was similar to mine
Who got here first?
Tom's feet are swollen
Did you enjoy studying French?
We weren't ready for this
I've been waiting for this day
The machine's stopped running
That's the likely outcome
Do I have to go, too?
Why don't we stop here?

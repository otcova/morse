It's eleven o'clock now
It's nine o'clock now
It's eight o'clock now
We'll definitely come
Tom isn't enjoying this
Let's take a quick poll
Tom isn't a park ranger
Tom isn't watching golf
It wouldn't take much time
Tom isn't a waiter now
Tom isn't absent today
Tom isn't a bad kisser
Well, I didn't mean that
Tom isn't jumping rope
What's this doohickey?
Tom isn't a hairdresser
Why do you boycott Tom?
Tom isn't going to town
It's one o'clock now
It's two o'clock now
Tom isn't a specialist
Absolutely not!
It's now nine o'clock
Now take it easy, both of you
Tom isn't on the patio
Yanni's safe is very heavy
Yanni couldn't open the safe
Ah, I see what you mean
Tom isn't a fast runner
Tom isn't wearing boots
Tom isn't chopping wood
Don’t vomit there!
Tom isn't leaving soon
He's not a great teacher
As a teacher, he's only so-so
Tom isn't eating bread
Tom isn't scared of you
Tom isn't going fishing
Tom isn't in the attic
Tom isn't still at work
Tom isn't still eating
Tom isn't my classmate
Tom isn't all that bright
It's a fun party trick
Tom isn't next in line
Tom isn't an exception
That isn't quite what I meant
Tom isn't with Mary now
Tom isn't listening now
You've seen her
You've seen them
They've seen them
Tom isn't our youngest

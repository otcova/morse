I knew you'd understand
I knocked, but no one answered
I know all about you, Tom
I know exactly what I'm asking
I know exactly what's going on
I know how hard it's been
I know how to count to 100
I know how you feel, Tom
I know how you're feeling
I know I'll never forget you
I know I'm early
I know I'm going to be sick
I know I'm in the way
I know I'm innocent
I know I've been hard on you
I know I've let you down
I know it isn't always easy
I know it isn't the truth
I know it wasn't easy
I know it wasn't Tom
I know it's against the law
I know it's awful
I know it's cold
I know it's difficult to see
I know it's difficult
I know it's either Tom or Mary
I know it's hard to believe
I know it's hard to understand
I know it's hard
I know it's heavy
I know it's here somewhere
I know it's hot
I know it's important to you
I know it's important work
I know it's impossible
I know it's in here somewhere
I know it's not a joke
I know it's not fair
I know it's not impossible
I know it's not possible
I know it's not true
I know it's not your fault
I know it's only a dream
I know it's Tom
I know it's true
I know that job wasn't easy
I know somebody's watching me
I know someone's here
I know that you're lying
I know that's important to you
I know that's not enough
I know that's not true
I know there's something here
I know they're both happy
I know they're still alive
I know this isn't easy for you
I know this isn't easy
I know Tom isn't a racist
I know Tom isn't guilty
I know Tom saved Mary's life
I know Tom's house is for sale
I know Tom's three children
I know Tom's widow
I know Tom's wife
I know Tom's work
I know we're a little early
I know we're different
I know what I'd say
I know what I'm dealing with
I know what I'm feeling
I know what I'm going to do
I know what I'm saying
I know what I've experienced
I know what's at stake
I know what it's called
I know what it's like

I know what they're capable of
I know what they're doing
I know what they're like
I know what they're paying you
I know what we've got
I know what you're afraid of
I know what you're after
I know what you're feeling

I know what you're saying
I know what you're up to
I know what you've done
I know what you've risked
I know what'll cheer you up
I know what's going on here
I know what's going on
I know what's happened to Tom
I know what's happening
I know what's involved
I know what's missing
I know what's on your mind
I know what's up
I know what's wrong with me
I know what's wrong with Tom
I know what's wrong with you
I know when I'm being deceived
I know when I'm being lied to
I know when I'm not needed
I know when I'm not wanted
I know when Tom's birthday is
I know where I'm going next
I know where they're going
I know where Tom's office is
I know where you're going
I know who we're dealing with
I know who's on the list
I know why we're doing this
I know why you're doing this
I know you can't forgive me
I know you can't stop Tom
I know you don't like Tom
I know you think I'm crazy
I know you think I'm stupid
I know you'll be back
I know you'll do a good job
I know you'll get the job
I know you'll like Tom
I know you'll make me proud
I know you're a spy
I know you're afraid of flying
I know you're afraid of snakes
I know you're afraid

I know you're doing your best
I know you're frustrated
I know you're going to say no
I know you're going to win
I know you're guilty
I know you're happy
I know you're here, Tom
I know you're hiding somewhere
I know you're hungry
I know you're in here
I know you're in trouble
I know you're innocent
I know you're listening
I know you're looking at me
I know you're lying
I know you're mad
I know you're nervous
I know you're not a doctor
I know you're not comfortable
I know you're not like Tom
I know you're not lying
I know you're not serious
I know you're not that stupid
I know you're richer than me
I know you're shocked
I know you're skeptical
I know you're still mad
I know you're tired
I know you're Tom
I know you're trying to help
I know you're trying very hard
I know you're working for Tom
I know you're working with Tom
I know you're writing a book
I know you've got a gun
You are becoming lazy!
Here's my room
I've got more secrets
I left around 2:30
I like baseball, too
I like it when it's cold
I like it when it's hot
I like it when it's snowing
I like you a lot, Tom
I live in Boston, too
Do you like to play golf?
We're about to finish the tour
Is it really everywhere?
Can you ice-skate?
I've got a six-year-old son
Why is the dog here?
Very good job!
Congratulations!
They can't possibly work
I looked in Tom's eyes
I looked through Tom's wallet
I love what you're wearing
Is the field fertile?
I made fun of Tom's accent
I didn't make any mistakes
Did you like it?
I made you laugh, didn't I?
I make you nervous, don't I?
There's a band at my school
How stupid I am..
We don't have a second choice
So tired!
So how have you guys been?
Oh, you know..
Same old, same old.
I'd like to be an American
Do you want to eat something?
You'll drink four glasses
Will you still drink water?
Pessimists say "I'm not rich.
Hello!
I love you so much!
I'd like to ask you a favor
Genetics doesn't lie
I met Tom on Friday the 13th
I might be back by 2:30
I might have Tom's address
I might've done the same thing
I miss Mary's cooking
I mowed Tom's lawn
I must say I'm flattered
I must say I'm quite impressed
I must've dozed off
I must've lost some weight
I must've misplaced it
I need 30 minutes
I need a five-minute break
I need to know before 2:30
I need to know what's going on
I need to know why you're here
I need to know you're OK
I need Tom's address
I need Tom's file now
I need twenty-four hours
I never said I wasn't happy
I never said you couldn't go
I never should've come here
I never should've left
I never should've mentioned it
I never should've trusted Tom
I never thought I'd find Tom
I never thought I'd finish it
I never thought I'd say that
I never wanted this, either
He's nervous due to impatience
He's capable of doing it
I'm sticking my foot out
I'm sticking my leg out
She's eating lunch right now
I noticed that, too
I now know it's possible
I only hope I'm not too late
I only told you, no one else
I ordered fries, too
I don't think I can eat it all
I ought to know, shouldn't I?
I owe Tom 300 dollars
Do you want this T-shirt?
Do it again, just like before
I paid 30 dollars for that
I pay Tom's salary
I probably shouldn't do that
I promise I'll be quiet
I promise I'll call
I promise I'll pay you back
I promise I'll try
I realize it's hard to believe
I realized I couldn't win
I realized I wasn't ready
Is that a problem for you?
I'll pack my bag
I really am glad you're here
I really appreciate it, Tom
I really can't accept this
I really can't be late
I really can't do that
I really can't figure it out
I really can't take it anymore
I really can't talk about this
I really can't talk right now
I really hope you're right
I really think you'd like Tom
I really wasn't sure
There is a train at 10 o'clock
Is 6 o'clock OK?
I'll go to London next year
I reckon that's a good idea
I'm ready for this
How I love pineapples!
I recognized Tom's voice
Rain or snow, out you go
No one's seen Tom in a while
Why didn't somebody help Tom?
What a lousy camera!
Can you speak Esperanto?
I should've asked Tom first
They'll want Tom
Tom couldn't convince Mary
Just what have you done?
Aren't you also my friend?
It's up to you if we go
I've written an article
It's really cold today
We think he'll be back soon
Thank you so much, my friend
How do you make decisions?
Write what I say!
Therefore, she canceled on him
That's what Tom meant
I don't want to miss the exam
I want you to like me, Tom
Tom wants to kill you, Mary
Today is my friend's birthday
He is pigeon-toed
I won't go easy on them
Actually, I don't like coffee
Are you saying you don't know?
Are you sure you don't mind?
Back away, Tom
Beautiful, aren't they?
Concentrate, Tom
Did Tom hurt anyone?
Did you notice Tom leaving?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Didn't you hear what Tom said?
Didn't you read the manual?
Do you have any aspirin?
Do you think I don't care?
Do you want to buy a dress?
Do you want to buy a shirt?
Does that make sense to you?
Doesn't Tom need an oven?
Let's give him our old one
Don't antagonize Tom
Don't ask me
Don't be such a fool
Don't be such a jerk
Don't call me a jerk
Don't compare yourself to Tom
Don't eat without me
Don't flirt with me, Tom
Don't get me wrong, Tom
Don't give me that, Tom
Don't give up hope, Tom
Don't give up now, Tom
Don't go in there, Tom
Don't judge me too harshly
Don't jump to any conclusions
Don't let me influence you
Don't let that bother you
Don't lie to me, Tom
Don't make this difficult, Tom
Don't mention this to Tom
Don't move or I'll shoot
Don't move until I tell you to
Don't pull the plug yet
Don't raise your voice
Don't sell yourself short, Tom
Don't send me home, please
Don't take it personally, Tom
Don't take me for granted
Don't take Tom too seriously
Don't talk about me
Don't tell me to relax
Don't tell me
Don't tell the others, OK?
Don't tell Tom about this
Don't thank me
Don't think about that anymore
Don't touch me, you pig!
Don't toy with me, Tom
Don't worry about that now
Don't worry so much, Tom
Don't worry
Everything'll be fine
Don't worry
We're safe here
Don't you all agree?
Don't you care what happens?
Don't you have classes today?
Don't you have work today?
Don't you think it's risky?
Don't you watch old movies?
Everybody loves Tom, right?
Frankly, I don't care
Funny, I don't remember that
Help us, please
Hold still, Tom
How long has Tom been here?
Hurry up, please
I assume that was Tom's wife
I can't exactly tell Tom that
I can't find anything
I can't take Tom's money
I couldn't find it
I don't do all that much
I don't know what to expect
I don't know why Tom was fired
I don't know why you did it
I don't know why you need it
I don't like to clean
I don't meet too many women
I don't need crutches anymore
I don't usually eat this late
I don't want to stay
I don't want you to be upset
I hope you're wrong about this
I just don't want to hurt Tom
I know what I'd do
I shouldn't have let Tom go
I think you're funny
I wish we'd met earlier
I wish you hadn't found me
I wish you'd talk to me
I wish you'd told me before
I wish you'd trust me
I'd like to get an early start
I'd like to hear you sing
I'd like to keep expenses down
I'd like to know what it is
I'd like to know where Tom is
I'd like to make myself useful
I'd like to sit further back
I'd like to stand
I'm getting married next week
I'm glad you brought that up
I'm just not very hungry
I'm looking forward to that
I'm not trying to say anything
I'm not working for Tom
I'm sure Tom was involved
I'm the oldest
I've always been here
I've heard this story before
I've known Tom for a long time
I've missed out on so much
I've never been sedated before
I've never done harm to anyone
I've never even told my wife
I've never seen him before
I've never trusted strangers
I've worked very hard
If anyone can do it, it's Tom
Is it really so terrible?
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
It didn't happen that way
It doesn't matter what I think
It doesn't matter, right?
It doesn't seem fair, does it?
It feels weird, doesn't it?
It's 2:30 now
It's almost 2:30
It's booby-trapped
It's computer-generated
It's easily done
It's far-fetched
It's non-refundable
It's possible, isn't it?
It's ridiculous
It's sweet
It's what we always planned
It's worth checking out
Just don't get involved, OK?
Just don't tell anyone, OK?
Mary is my fiancée
What do you want to buy?
May I be excused for a minute?
May I be excused now?
May I be of assistance?
May I be of further service?
May I be of service?
May I borrow your car tonight?
May I borrow your lighter?
Meet me at 2:30
My name isn't Tom
Now don't be hasty, please
Now don't freak out, OK?
Now don't start crying, Tom
Obviously, you volunteered
Oh, didn't I mention it?
Oh, don't be like that
Oh, don't be so modest
Oh, please don't say that
Please don't interrupt me, Tom
I don't have all night
Sorry, I didn't hear you
Sorry, I didn't notice that
Stand up, Tom
Step aside, please
Stop it, please
That's sexual harassment!
We still have 30 minutes left.
Line up by height, please
He's a total moron
That's my pleasure, dear!
I'm going to buy a new camera
I love those big, green figs
I think that's correct
Yes, we want that
Mary doesn't like me
Mary won't like me
You won't like me
That didn't turn out too bad
That's exactly what I mean
That's kind of important
That's not my style
That's what doesn't make sense
That's what I told Tom
That's what scares me
That's what Tom is afraid of
There's no need to do that
They didn't make a deal
They don't want Tom there
They're all set
This doesn't seem normal to me
This is Tom's book
This won't be the last time
Tom and Mary don't like you
Tom arrived home at 2:30
Tom broke Mary's heart
Tom could've been anywhere
Tom didn't even know my name
Tom didn't make it in time
Tom didn't want to stay
Tom doesn't even know Mary
Tom doesn't know what this is
Tom doesn't know where he is
Tom doesn't know who to blame
Tom doesn't like this at all
Tom doesn't seem to be leaving
Tom doesn't seem to like it
Tom is babbling, isn't he?
Tom is celebrating, isn't he?
Tom is coming, too
Tom is contributing, isn't he?
Tom is crying, too
Tom is fighting, isn't he?
Tom is going, too
Tom is here, too
Tom is leaving, isn't he?
Tom is my fiancé
Tom isn't babbling, is he?
Tom isn't bad-looking
Tom isn't celebrating, is he?
Tom isn't contributing, is he?
Tom isn't fighting, is he?
Tom isn't leaving, is he?
Tom isn't much older than Mary
Tom left early, and so did we
Tom looks good, doesn't he?
Tom looks great, doesn't he?
Tom says he's not guilty
Tom sent you, didn't he?
Tom told you, didn't he?
Tom wouldn't remember me
Tom's family loved Mary
Tom's family loved me
Tom's grades didn't improve
Tom's confusion grew
Turn around, please
We can't help Tom now
We didn't do a thing
We didn't look very long
We didn't need to do that
We don't even need this
We don't have a problem
We don't have any money
We don't have any proof
We don't know our neighbors
We don't want to take anything
We had fun, didn't we?
We just don't know why
Tom's embarrassment grew
No, they'll find it there
Look there, up in the sky!
Look up there in the sky!
Look up there at the sky!
Oh, I almost forgot!
Today is garbage disposal day!
We're here, too
Welcome back, Tom
What could it be?
What other choice do we have?
What time did Tom get here?
What would you like Tom to do?
What're we waiting for?
What're you doing about this?
What're you looking for?
Whatever you do, don't blink
Whatever you do, don't run
Whatever you do, don't smile
When did you go to work?
When did you work in Boston?
Why are you studying French?
Why didn't you help Tom?
Why do I need to learn French?
Why don't we call it a day?
Why don't we call it a night?
Why don't we cancel the party?
Why don't we duck back inside?
Why don't you believe me?
Will I be able to find it?
You don't fit in here
You don't have to answer that
You don't know the system
You don't need a list
You don't need one now
You don't need to explain that
You like olives, don't you?
You recognize her, don't you?
You recognize him, don't you?
You speak French, don't you?
You speak French, right?
You understand French, right?
You won't be the first
You won't bleed to death
You'll call me, won't you?
You'll come back, won't you?
You're afraid, aren't you?
You're alone, aren't you?
You're always saying that
You're depressed, aren't you?
You're double-parked
You're going to be OK
You're impressed, aren't you?
You're in pain, aren't you?
You're not married, are you?
You're over-analyzing
You're picky, aren't you?
You're still mad, aren't you?
You're the one who trained me
You're Tom's students, right?
You're Tom's wife, aren't you?
You're worried, aren't you?
You've got to warn Tom
Tom doesn't know anything yet
I think you're attractive
You're quite attractive
Tom drives a black car, eh?
Hello!
How are you?
I'm fine and you?
You look fine!
Are you doing a special thing?
Get out!
You can't play here
What elements must occur?
What elements can occur?
Where can you get tickets?
Do you like Indonesian food?
I respect you, Tom
I respect your opinion, Tom
I can't wrap my head around it
Immediately!
Immediately!
Immediately!
Now!
Now!
Go now, or you'll miss the bus
I said back off!
I said be quiet!
I said come back here!
I said don't talk to me
I said drop it!
I said drop your gun!
I said drop your weapon!
I said get back!
I said get down!
I said get out!
I said get up!
I said I couldn't do it
I said I can't help you
I said I didn't hear anything
I said I wasn't hungry
I said I wasn't ready
I said I wasn't serious
I said I wouldn't tell Tom
I said I wouldn't worry
I said I'd do it
I said I'd figure it out
I said I'd help
I said I'd look after Tom
I said I'd tell you the truth
I said I'd think about it
I said I'd wait for Tom
I said I'd wait
I said I'll be fine
I said I'll do it
I said I'll get it
I said I'd get it
I said I'll think about it
I said I'm fine
I said I'm sorry
I said I'm tired of it
I said it wasn't possible
I said put it down!
I said put the gun down!
I said stay back!
I said stop it!
I said stop right there!
I said stop this now!
I said that's all I know
I said that's enough
I said we don't have to hurry
I said we'd find Tom
I said we'll get one
I said we'd get one
I said we'll take care of it
I said we'd take care of it
I said we're closed
I said we're finished
I saved Tom's life
I saw a mouse!
I saw how you saved Tom's life
I saw it, too
I saw the fear in Tom's eyes
I saw the look on Tom's face
I saw Tom kissing John's wife
I saw Tom's birth certificate
I saw Tom's daughter last week
I saw Tom's face
I saw Tom's father
I saw Tom's name on the cover
I saw Tom's name on the list
I saw Tom's picture
I saw Tom's pictures
I say it's time for a change
I say it's worth a try
I say it's worth the risk
I see I'm wasting my time
I see we're all here
I see what you're doing
I see what's going on
I see why Tom doesn't like you
I see you've done this before
I see you've found your book
I see your point, Tom
I should do that, too
I should tell Tom I'm back
I should've become a teacher
I should've been a movie star
I should've been asked first
I should've been more precise
I should've been more specific
I should've been more thorough
I should've been ready
I should've been there for Tom
I should've been there for you
I should've been there sooner
I should've been there
I should've been with Tom
I should've called first
I should've called for help
I should've called you
I should've checked
I should've foreseen this
I should've gone after Tom
I should've gone camping
I should've gone fishing
I should've gone hunting
I should've gone with Tom
I should've introduced myself
I should've just shut up
I should've kept going
I should've kept my cool
I should've kissed Mary
I should've known it was you
I should've known this
I should've left Tom a note
I should've listened to Tom
I should've recognized Tom
I should've said 2:30
I should've said I was busy
I should've said no
I should've said that
I should've said yes
I should've seen it coming
I should've stayed at home
I should've stayed in Boston
I should've stayed in school
I should've studied French
I should've told Tom earlier
I should've told Tom no
I should've told Tom the truth
I should've told Tom
I should've told you
I should've trained Tom myself
I should've tried harder
I should've tried to stop it
I should've warned Tom
I should've worked out more
I should've worn a hat
I should've worn gloves
I should've written it down
I shouldn't be doing this
I shouldn't be too late
I shouldn't be too much longer
I shouldn't even be here
I shouldn't have asked you
I shouldn't have asked
I shouldn't have been driving
I shouldn't have brought it up
I shouldn't have called
I shouldn't have done this
I shouldn't have doubted you
I shouldn't have drunk so much
I shouldn't have interfered
I shouldn't have lied to you
I shouldn't have lied
I shouldn't have married Mary
I shouldn't have said anything
I shouldn't have said that
I shouldn't have taken it
I shouldn't have told Tom
I shouldn't have told you
I shouldn't have tricked Tom
I shouldn't have yelled at Tom
I shouldn't really be here
I snapped Tom's picture
I speak French, too
I spoke with Tom's assistant
I stepped on Tom's dog's tail
I still can't believe I did it
I still can't believe it
I still can't reach Tom
I still can't tell you why
I still don't think I'm wrong
I still haven't finished
I still haven't found my keys
I still haven't found Tom
I still haven't told Tom
I still say we should've gone
I still think it's weird
I supervised Tom's training
I support you 100%
I suppose anything's possible
I suppose I'd better leave
I suppose I'd better phone Tom
I suppose it can't be helped
I suppose it's my fault
I suppose it's possible
I suppose it's time to go
I suppose that's a possibility
I suppose that's all right
I suppose that's allowed
I suppose that's impossible
I suppose that's OK
I suppose that's possible
I suppose that's true
I suppose you think I'm crazy
I suppose you think I'm nuts
I suppose you think I'm rich
I suppose you'll let Tom go
I suppose you're right
I sure hope that's not true
I suspect you're right
I suspect you're wrong
I swear I didn't do anything
I swear I won't tell anyone
I swear I'll stop you
I swear I'm telling the truth
I swear it isn't my fault
I swear it wasn't me
I swear it wasn't my fault
I swear it's not my fault
I swear it's the last time
I swear that's all I want
I swiped Tom's pencil
I swore I'd never be like Tom
I swore I'd never do that
I swore I'd never tell anyone
I take it that's unusual
I take it you're not married
I take it you're not surprised
I take it you've seen the news
How was yours?
I think I know Tom's secret
I think I know what's wrong
I think I'd better call Tom
I think I'd better go back now
I think I'd better go
I think I'd better head home
I think I'd better help Tom
I think I'd better start now
I think I'd like that
I think I'd rather not do that
I think I'd rather not know
I think I'd rather walk
I think I'll always love Mary
I think I'll be fine
I think I'll be going home now
I think I'll be going
I think I'll be leaving
I think I'll be OK in a minute
I think I'll call it a day
I think I'll call it a night
I think I'll eat later
I think I'll get back to work
I think I'll get over it
I think I'll get some rest
I think I'll go and get Tom
I think I'll go talk to Tom
I think I'll go to bed early
I think I'll go wash my hands
I think I'll take a walk
I think I'll take it
I think I'll take this one
I think I'll talk to Tom
I think I'll turn in
I think I'll wait here
I think I'm all right
I think I'm being followed
I think I'm done
I think I'm dying
I think I'm expected
I think I'm getting a headache
I think I'm going mad
I think I'm going to cry
I think I'm going to go inside
I think I'm going to like this
I think I'm going to try again
I think I'm in big trouble
I think I'm in love with you
I think I'm in the right place
I think I'm lost
I think I'm OK
I think I'm ready for a change
I think I've always loved Mary
I think I've broken my arm
I think I've found the problem
I think I've got a better idea
I think I've had enough
I think I've heard enough
I think I've made a mistake
I think I've met Tom before
I think I've persuaded Tom
I think I've seen enough
I think it's a brilliant idea
I think it's a great idea
I think it's all right now
I think it's dangerous
I think it's fascinating
I think it's fine
I think it's funny
I think it's going to be fun
I think it's going well
I think it's interesting
I think it's necessary
I think it's nice around here
I think it's time for us to go
I think it's time to begin
I think it's time to leave
I think it's time we left
I think it's Tom's motorcycle
I think it's too cold to swim
I think it's too risky
I think it's very dangerous
I think it's very impressive
I think it's very nice
I think it's very romantic
I think it's wonderful
I think it's working
I think it's worth the risk
I think I've made my point
I think perhaps you're right
I think that's a good plan
I think that's a great idea
I think that's a mistake
I think that's an exaggeration
I think that's awful
I think that's best
I think that's better
I think that's enough for now
I think that's enough
I think that's everything
I think that's fair
I think that's highly unlikely
I think that's horrible
I think that's right
I think that's the point
I think that's the problem
I think that's to be expected
I think that's Tom over there
I think that's very clear
I think that's what Tom wants
I think that's where Tom is
I think that's where Tom works
I think that's why Tom is here
I think that's wise
I think that's wonderful
I think there's a problem
I think there's been a mistake
I think they're students
I think Tom said he'd be back
I think Tom wants Mary's job
I think Tom's doing a good job
I think Tom's leg is broken
I think we got Tom's attention
I think we'd better be going
I think we'll be OK
I think we'll be safe here
I think we'll find Tom

Tom couldn't move his arm
Don't get in the way
Tom's face was full of regret
How often do you use taxis?
I think I'll stay right here
Tom couldn't do any better
To some people, it is
Who can answer that question?
I've found somebody new
Tom said that he's sober
Why so many questions?
Can I ask you a little favor?
How many alphabets exist?
We need a plan, stat!
How about we play a match?
Is that a possum?
Who's this music by?
It's up to Tom
What's troubling Tom?
Is this music on Spotify?
What did he do to you now?
Does that outfit fit you?
It probably wasn't Tom
That probably wasn't Tom
What did he have?
Did Tom leave without you?
Did Tom go there without you?
Quit your barking!
Was it you that wrote this?
He doesn't bite?
How late are you staying up?
We're open
I wonder what's going on there
I'm going to stay home all day
Don't cry anymore
It's not raining all that hard
I'd like to see it again
Did you bring sandwiches?
I didn't betray anyone
I haven't betrayed anyone
You're a generous person
You're a laid-back person
I have to win, no matter what
I don't eat Mongolian food
That's inhumane
You're the only adult here
Do you know your genealogy?
Don't add fuel to the fire
You're adding fuel to the fire
Is "Y" a consonant or a vowel?
College enrollment is down 2%
He's not going to move
Did you hear the bell ring?
Well, blame yourself
Well, blame yourselves
If so, blame yourself
If so, blame yourselves
Tom didn't recognize the sound
It's paradise here in spring
Please don't just stand there
Was it Tom, or someone else?
It's not so complicated
I'm telling you, you're wrong
Tom couldn't stand up
Tom couldn't get up
Is there a ghost in the shell?
Why are you soaking wet?
I've fallen into the pool.
I've seen an angel once
Then, I dry them under the sun
What are those children doing?
We'll be in Australia all week
Tom couldn't afford that
Tom's horse kicked him
Tom is stuck in a dead-end job
I've got to leave
I've swept all the rooms
I'm not the one who said that
I'd never say it that way
That's not the reason I'm here
The TV remote isn't working
You needn't have told Tom
Do you remember when that was?
Tom's glasses are cool
I'll stand by you
Don't do it like Tom, please
Tom is late, as usual
That's the way it all began
I'm leaving forever
There's no place to park
He's dead?
Tom sure is a livewire!
Have you ever eaten javelina?
His derring-do knew no bounds
Did your parents like London?
Calm down!
Do you take vitamin pills?
How could you be so unkind?
Tom couldn't unlock the door
You truly did well!
How do they treat you?
They're getting fat
Don't pick up the phone
Don't answer the phone
How did they treat you?
How were you treated?
I won't do that after all
You've always supported me
Tom couldn't read very well
Russia isn't on another planet
I'm unable to do that today
How to relieve stress?
How do I relieve stress?
Ziri focused on Rima's words
Ziri kept saying: "I'm safe.
Putin can't be toppled
Who is going to replace Putin?
Putin can't be impeached
Putin isn't physically ill
Putin isn't mentally ill
Putin can't be removed
Putin can't be assassinated
Putin revived Russia's economy
The West can't defeat Putin
Putin isn't afraid of the West
Thief" is such a vulgar term
Buccaneering isn't easy!
I'm Mary
I'd love to go there with you
I don't have a newspaper
Let's have a short break
Are there any parks in town?
Pass me my glasses, please
Pass me my specs, please
Thanks to him, we're here
What time is it now in London?
This is mind-blowing
Tom didn't get into Harvard
Nothing escapes you!
Nothing gets past you!
You've got a sense of humour
Tom filled Mary's glass again
You've got chronic bronchitis
I'm telling you you're wrong
Call me at 9 o'clock tomorrow
Tom could've gone anywhere
How long's this going to last?
Don't let them near you
I don't like mushrooms
I know what you're eating
I know that you're eating
You haven't seen him
Whatever changed your mind?
Hurry up!
The bus is coming!
You're walking down the street
I'm not criticizing them
Here, take it
Tom couldn't get out
What's the next thing to do?
Stop typing.
We'll always remember you
What's an emotional breakdown?
I now know that it's true
Men wear short-sleeved shirts
Tom mustn't die
I've seen what you can do
Good job, everybody!
There is no use arguing!
Do it quickly!
The file won't open
The file doesn't open
I've got to get back home
Why wait any longer?
Tom couldn't feel his legs
Can you hear him?
Do you hear him?
Where did I put the key?
Where'd I put the key?
Why do you think it's him?
Do you know any of those guys?
Tom didn't get his job back
By all accounts, Tom does that
Bring me some water, please
You should've asked me earlier
I've tried hard to be patient
Who did Tom sell his land to?
What's in your boot?
It's in the boot
Ask her when she'll be back
I'm just back from the UK
I've just returned from the UK
How is hide-and-seek played?
How do you play hide-and-seek?
Hide-and-seek, how is it done?
Yes, I made mistakes
I'm a man, not a machine
You're close to the truth
I promise that I'll be there
Apparently, Tom won't do that
I've been faithful to you
It's cozy here
Tom's parents didn't like Mary
Ziri doesn't like to quit
No one's allowed back there
That's going to leave a bruise
I'm very content with my life
Where is the cat?
It is on the roof.
It's a pretty easy job
Only in my room.
Where did I put the newspaper?
Where did I put the paper?
When are we going home?
Don't worry
You'll be sorry someday
Who is there in the room?
I'm happy when we're together
Tom is a shoe-shine boy
Exactly, that is indispensable
Exactly, that is required
Exactly, that is what I need
Are newspapers sold here?
I'm writing with yours
That one's not mine
You're still in trouble
I'll try to check it out
Where did you hear about us?
You're out of shape
I'll go get dressed
Would you like some fish?
Don't you see any birds?
It's such a stupid idea
I'll take care of her myself
That's not the only difficulty
Did you get a haircut?
No, I got them all cut.
Tom wasn't at the funeral
That one isn't mine
I've met someone new
It's a school
That's the school I went to
It's time to leave
Let's listen to the radio
How did Tom get killed?
Did you make a big mess?
When's your honeymoon?
Tom couldn't eat any more
It's snowing in April
It's not uncommon for us
He doesn't like animals
Do they respond to you?
It ain't true
She's Palestinian
I'll leave in a minute
Can color blindness be cured?
You didn't pass the test
I shouldn't have lied to him
Who did Tom sell his house to?
Has Tom got a fixation on you?
Do you have a dress code?
Tom could've fired Mary
I'm not getting any stronger
How did you befriend Tom?
Who else did Tom attack?
I think it's better that way
I've just got back from the UK
The new guy's name is Tom
He's a friend of mine
He's in a tricky situation
Yes, I'm coming now
When is Tom going?
Is she a singer?
Is Tom still in prison?
Who did Tom sell his cows to?
Yes, I've made mistakes
So that's why Tom got angry
We're having fun, aren't we?
Tom wasn't in his bed
I've never thought about that
I've never thought of that
I didn't get to bed until dawn
I don't like tempura much
I think it's too greasy
Let's see if you can do that
Tom's left hand is swollen
Whose is that shirt?
She's buying shirts
Which shirt is pink?
This shirt looks old-fashioned
Mary is ironing Tom's shirts
Where's my white shirt?
Where's my white dress shirt?
He's wearing a green shirt
This shirt isn't my size
Get into bed, it's cold
Is that a dairy cow?
I had a short-sleeved shirt
What color is your shirt?
How long will it take to walk?
You'll learn on the job!
Are you a native of England?
I don't know what it's made of
Is that really true?
Yeah, probably.
Tom could've told Mary
That's rich, coming from you
She's likely to win the prize
There's a stone in my shoe
I've got a stone in my shoe
It's sickening
We'd like to hire a boat
I'd like to hire a boat
We'd like to hire a car
I'd like to hire a car
I've found you an apartment
I'd like to hire a bicycle
I'd never say it like that
You've got to see this through
Do you know anyone in Bristol?
Why?
I've found a flat for you
I've found you a flat
I'm quite busy right now
My wife couldn't come
Tom won't go anywhere
Don't chicken out!
Don't think badly of me
What's yours?
My friend is a bit off-kilter
She's partial to sweets
She's loved by everyone
She's in the wrong
She's forbidden to go out
She's accustomed to sitting
She's gentle with children
She's the only friend I have
She's handy with a needle
She's ignorant of the world
He's older and wiser now
He's deeply in debt now
He's now at the desk
He's on the radio
He's a man of noble birth
He's an expert in economics
May I ask for your help?
Don't let Tom ruin your life
It's cosy here
I'm posting it again anyways.
I'm deleting this sentence.
I'm posting it again.
I might've lost my keys
Maybe I've lost my keys
Can it go any quicker?
Can it be done faster?
I'm sceptical about that
As for that, I'm sceptical
What has he done now?
What has he gone and done now?
You've still got enough time
You've still got time
We can't see him
I'd be surprised by that
Has the postman been?
Has the postie been?
How far are we now?
If only I'd stayed at home
She doesn't drink alcohol
Tom's got a stepbrother
I'm on the train
I'm now on the train
Do you get it now?
Are you the new boss?
If only I'd stayed at home!
What's he gone and done now?
I'm a clean freak
Tom couldn't even move
Tom could've texted me
You'd better not write here
How long have you had eczema?
Look what I have!
Hail, Caesar!
Tom's plan didn't work
Who controls the Internet?
I didn't mention names
Poor you!
I'll be a little bit late
What if they're alive?
He's entertaining her
He's entertaining him
Someone's calling my name
She's slim
He's wearing a black hat
Yes, there is nothing easier!
Watch out!
Let's swap places
Want to swap places?
That's the easiest thing ever!
It's easy as hell
It's as easy as can be
That's as simple as it gets
I think it's made out of steel
Tom can't be counted on
You can't count on Tom
Your children are invited, too
Is it OK to lick your knife?
Don't slurp your spaghetti
Would you like to swap places?
Do you want to swap places?
Tom didn't get his money back
It's time for us to stop
That's all I want to eat now
They'll surely like it
I'm sure they'll like it
Everybody thinks I'm happy
Whoosh!
Whoosh!
We don't need extravagance
I'm secretly in love with him
It's time to learn Danish
Tom couldn't stand Mary
Tom wasn't being rude
Spell it!
Think on it!
Reflect on it!
Hey, I'm here!
We need an actionable plan!
Whomp!
Tom's made my bad book
Could this have been avoided?
I'll be coming home soon
Tom hasn't noticed this
I don't need her present
Let's see how it works
Here's what I'd do
It's made of plastic
Can I make a booking?
Let's stop and have a break
I've got some stamps in my bag
Bring me a cup of tea, please
I can't carry all the luggage
It's too dark to play tennis
I hope you'll phone again
I hope you'll ring again
I'll tell him to ring you back
It's sweltering outside
It's boiling outside
Moli" means orange in Fijian
He's not in the house
It's not in the house
Let us through, please
I can't let you through
Go on, then, what's happened?
Who's that bloke there?
One of Tom's mates.
There's no one here
Where is everyone?
Should I leave half for you?
Shall I leave you half?
He's from Poland
We're at uni together.
It's very stuffy
Can we open the window?
It's very stuffy
Can the window be opened?
Did you see who shot Tom?
Please don′t make me go
Is your hotel nearby?
Tom didn't bathe yesterday
Tom hasn't read this book
Ziri's dog was growling again
Ziri didn't blink
Ziri didn't answer Rima
Ziri noticed Rima's side arm
Ziri's face was a bit off
Ziri stopped, too
Ziri's life was in danger
Ziri's village has no Wi-Fi
Ziri's baby was in its blanket
We don't have wolves here
Ziri wasn't driving
Ziri didn't protest either
Ziri didn't hear any crickets
Ziri didn't disbelieve Rima
Tom couldn't see who it was
Sometimes, age comes alone
Did you update the page?
Tell me you won't do that
I've seen you do that before
Let's go eat something
Don't aim at me
Please don't do it that way
I never thought about it!
Have you ever slept on a bus?
Tom should've seen that coming
He's a drone pilot
I've understood
Let's do that next time.
You're eating chocolate again
Yep, I love it!
Chocolate, or me?
Chocolate, of course.
I was born January 22, 1993
Dying because of... hail?
I've heard enough already
I've gotten tired
God, just how lazy are you?
I totally get what you mean.
Woah, you scared me!
What color is this?
It's pale orange.
I'll go right now.
Yeah, yeah, exactly!
That's what I wanted to say
How's college?
How is it?
Uh, well, normal, I guess.
Made any friends?
Eh, a couple.
I wonder, is Tom really a boy?
What do you mean?
What?
I'm very sorry.
Tom could've been shot
You want a bite?
Yeah!
It'll be fine
Damn, it's 4 already?
So, an all-nighter?
Sure, let's do that.
Oh, him?
Alright!
I won!
How about pizza for lunch?
Pizza?
What flower is it made with?
Look, it's written right here.
Oh, it is
Let's try buying this.
I won't be leaving
If something's wrong, tell me
The automobile emerged in 1886
Rima's cooking is tasty
You haven't paid Tom yet
Who else wants to do this?
Ziri's lights are on
Ziri won't tell us anything
Ziri isn't entirely sure
Ziri's heart sank
Ziri didn't mind
Ziri saw his uncle's car
Ziri started speed-walking
Ziri wasn't good at all
Ziri's suspicion was confirmed
It's lightning
Ziri wasn't sitting up
Ziri lives in Tigzirt, Algeria
Ziri pays for Rima's flights
Ziri didn't really mind
Ziri shouldn't mention this
Ziri wrote Rima's name down
Ziri went up to Rima's desk
Ziri's smile faded
This happened back in 2004
Ziri was at Rima's location
One of them was Ziri's cousin
Ziri's house is old
Ziri didn't find anyone
Ziri lives in a cul-de-sac
Ziri isn't far away
I've been working like a dog
Is the weather hot today?
I think she's perfect
Tom's phone rang again
I regret what I've done
Don't blame that on Tom
Please don't touch that
Tom's house has a back porch
This bucket's got a hole in it
Is it a good language?
Don't get it wrong
Don't get it confused
Excuses won't work on me
I don't really get it
You're such an idiot
You're great at what you do
What should I do?
Are you a model?
Or an actress?
I'm just a student.
What's the use of hiding?
I'll be here at home
My wife's sister lives with us
Tom couldn't turn around
I can't walk yet
Are you going to give up here?
That's great!
I'm afraid I can't come.
That's a pity!
I should've come by bike
I'll read more tomorrow
There's not one student here
What?
Who's saying that?
Ah, the photos from the trip!
No, not yet.
Ah, the photos from the trip!
Yeah, earlier on.
I'm shattered
We're watching a new film
The rain still hasn't stopped
It hasn't stopped raining yet
Who's been smoking here?
I haven't found your book
I didn't find your book
Don't go anywhere
Mary!
Well, this is a surprise
Come in!
Have you eaten yet?
May I have a look at it?
Are your hands clean?
Who's been smoking in here?
She's making breakfast
Are we eating now?
Shall we eat now?
I don't feel at all well
Can I have this cake?
Do you want anything to drink?
No, thanks.
If you do it, do it right
Is Ukraine a no-fly zone?
Russia has 6000 warheads
What about the Palestinians?
Wait for me, please
Can she come too?
Are you a vegetarian?
Are you?
What did he call you?
What did you find in that box?
Ziri's email contains typos
She doesn't swim very well
Can you save the world?
Very.
You won't let me go
When did you get the letter?
I'm writing to him now
I can't trust people like you
He won't get sleepy
He won't be sleepy
Can you delete this photo?
How long was he gone?
I'm aware that it'll be risky
My mouth's already watering
You've made me so very happy
My mother is over 80 years old
I'll show you all yet
I'm well aware of the danger
They can't fool me
The TV isn't working well
I'm hungry
Do we have anything?
Yeah, I'll take it.
Yeah.
Let's order another pizza
I still haven't said anything
That happiness won't last
May Tom's dream come true
What time do you think it is?
Seriously.
Let's buy some new ones
Ah, just what I thought
They haven't noticed
If there is, let me know
You'll see
I don't remember lying to you
Let's see what has changed
What kind of movie is it?
Tom doesn't like animals
Tom can't be tired
I've read all these books
When did you get this letter?
I can't walk as fast as you
Tom wasn't freaked out
Do you have soft drinks?
I'm sure Tom can hear us
Who else did Tom hit?
Hezbollah won't go down easily
I remember Tom's daughters
Who teaches Tom French?
Why did Tom sell his car?
Tom isn't worried at all
I'll love you till I die
You've really changed me
This isn't worth my time
Tom isn't paying alimony
I've found someone new
I've found someone for the job
Where's the cat?
It's on the roof.
Tom could've saved Mary
Apparently, Tom didn't do that
This feels great!
I'm into collecting insects
How long are you staying?
Someday, you'll understand
Tom doesn't vote
Mary isn't my sister
She's my cousin
I love Mary, and she loves me
How long will you be staying?
About a fortnight.
It's too high in calories
I won't tell him anything
I don't like this photo
I'm building a dacha
I'm building a summer house
She's got a husband and kids
It's a novel worth reading
It doesn't stop at every stop
We'd like to check in
Shall I make a suggestion?
Do I need a ticket?
I didn't know the protocol
What was your worst job?
I'll be with you in an hour
That's going to leave a stain
It wasn't the best idea
He's wiping off the counter
He's wiping off the countertop
Don't scatter the cattle
He's twirling his mustache
How do you tighten this bolt?
To the right or to the left?
How do you tighten this bolt?
Clockwise or counterclockwise?
Can you lend me tweezers?
I'm burning with curiosity
Don't get yourself wound up
You've just seen her
Tom didn't allow that
Do chairs exist?
It's a common symptom
Why did you laugh?
Tom and I weren't married
Does she want to stay here?
See you!
Come back often!
Is this the last group?
Is that the last group?
I've decided to grow a beard
I've decided to sell my house
What'll you have for lunch?
What'll we have for dinner?
You've never given me anything
How many pages is this book?
I'd rather do something else
My sister-in-law lives with us
If anyone's to blame, it's you
Did you hear Tom?
Tom didn't blink
This concerns you, too
When will you tell Tom?
It's too bad, really
You'll be asked to do that
Tom couldn't get past Mary
Ziri stormed off, sulking
At least, Ziri still has Rima
Things aren't so bad after all
Ziri read Rima's tarot cards
Ziri's life is going to change
Ziri is not Rima's usual type
Ziri's business was improving
Rima couldn't see other guys
Ziri wasn't cheating
It didn't work out for Ziri
Ziri is actually Rima's cousin
Ziri's gym clothes were wet
Ziri's brother was gross
Ziri related to Rima's stories
Where have the videos gone?
How did Ziri find Rima?
Ziri brought Rima's laptop
Out!
Ziri was Rima's Berber teacher
Ziri became Rima's archenemy
Ziri shouldn't act like that
Let me see your face, sweetie
By the way, Ziri is here
You wanna say hello?
The principal is here.
It couldn't get any worse.
Ziri has a girlfriend?
Ziri's best friend is annoying
Ziri's sauces are divine
Ziri?
Why are you here?
Ziri didn't deserve that
Ziri's gaze fixed on Rima
Ziri's anger melted away
Tom wasn't fooled
Ziri's parents were so nice
Ziri copied Rima's handwriting
Ziri can't eat seafood
Ziri hopped into Rima's life
Ziri has been selfish, too
That's all I can do right now
I'll check on that
We haven't yet talked about it
I think Tom won't be there
Just don't get lost!
I wasn't planning to.
It's too bad Tom isn't here
Who did Tom sell his truck to?
Down with capitalist slavery!
I said I didn't need it
No, you heard right
Tom's room is small
I'm a native of Odessa
Check this out!
Is this information true?
Why did the news get out?
Can you save this world?
Did we see the army?
Can I have my own room?
Did you check out everything?
Have you come to humiliate me?
We're done talking to you
Did you eat the entire cake?
Do you want to save your game?
Where'd you go?
Guess it's time to go
Should we jump down this pit?
Tom couldn't leave his home
Why do you need her?
Tom could've killed us both
Tom could've killed both of us
Everybody mourned Tom's death
We'll be even busier tomorrow
Tom's acting is very good
I'll be majoring in French
Happy belated birthday!
She's not at all worried
I'm having a shower tonight
Tom's not daft, you know
Or was it Tom?
Who's there?
Isn't there?
Who are you, then?
Read and obey them.
You what?
There is no Sam, only Tom
Tom from Boston.
Listen, mate
Is not.
What?
Tom exists.
Let's hire a rowing boat
Let's have a nice cup of tea
Let's have an early night
I've heard all your excuses
How did Model T get its name?
I don't know whose idea it was
Probably Tom's
Ugh, I hate work
I don't wanna go
You're not allowed out now.
How come?
When are you going shopping?
When will you go shopping?
When do you go shopping?
If I'm free, I'll be there
It's 6.20
Where did you hang your coat?
Could you lock the door?
Why did Tom sell his horse?
Are you in America yet?
Please don't start lying
And the Oscar goes to..
How did you get out of there?
Turn off the TV and go to bed.
But Dad...
Ziri is Rima's karate teacher
This story's worth reading
I can't call
Ziri didn't dare come out
Ziri is around Rima's age
Ziri's life would be fantastic
Ziri stuttered: "R..
Rima?
How about coming with us?
Ziri didn't bother me anymore
Ziri can't be around Rima
Ziri doesn't know his parents
Ziri's real dad is in Algiers
Ziri stroked Rima's hair
Where is the ocean?
Ziri's door slammed shut
Ziri's kitchen was messy
Ziri's food is so salty
Ziri dodged Rima's questions
Who built this house?
Now's not the time for that
I'll race you upstairs
Why not as a man?
Here's a ticket for you
Tom couldn't work
When can you come over?
Should someone do something?
Do we have to go back?
I don't like this one
Did you equip the armor?
How much do you want for it?
Isn't that an archaism?
Who lived here back then?
Mary's been taken hostage
You've been a bad dog
Can I borrow your glue stick?
Everything's going smoothly
She's pretending
That's evidence
That's not a problem anymore
That isn't a problem anymore
Why does Sonja feel bad?
Did you quit your job?
I think we're done for the day
Do you think this wine is OK?
I wish I hadn't given up
Let's try not to be late
Take him, for example
What am I to you, Tom?
I'm an outspoken person
Are they European?
No.
Err..
Not really.
I mean, not all of them.
Then why should I care?
What is to be human?
Who's laughing upstairs?
I'll be reading a book tonight
I'm a well-adjusted person
What's his size?
XL.
Catch!
Alright, let's go
I'll lead
I'm looking for my book
He's waiting for my response
Tom wasn't invited, was he?
I'm about to shoot him
I remember Tom's son
Shall I leave?
I won't go if it's raining
Don't stay there too long
Put colors in your life!
Tom couldn't do his homework
Let's buy everyone a drink
I've always wanted do this
I've always wanted to try this
Tom isn't related to Mary
Isn't my father going to eat?
Don't let anyone in the house
You're the cutest girl here
They'll also be there
Will they be there too?
They will be there, too
Why did Tom sell his house?
Tom couldn't take another step
You've got the wrong address
We've been duped
How many cars does he have?
Do you have spare keys?
Which professions do you like?
We just can't trust anyone
I knew you couldn't stay
I knew you wouldn't stay
You don't need to say a thing
You don't have to say a thing
I can't say I'm satisfied
I can't say that I'm satisfied
You can't say I never tried
Will you be there, too?
What does a dog say?
I'm trying to keep you safe
Let's stay on the path
Tom couldn't see Mary at all
I'll stay in Osaka
I'm staying in Osaka
Do we need tickets?
Is a ticket necessary?
Where are the nearest toilets?
Which is my stop?
Do we need to buy tickets?
You're much too young
Who else did Tom talk to?
I'll stay in Boston
I'll be staying in Boston
Tom couldn't open his hands
I'm afraid of losing Tom

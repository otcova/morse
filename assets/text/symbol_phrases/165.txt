She's continuously interrupted
There's a use of body language
She's now a figure of the past
Tottie isn't always rational
He's now a figure of the past
I'm okay with that
Can I borrow your socks?
No.
Just once.
He kissed you, didn't he?
You kissed him, didn't you?
Where did he kiss you?
On my lips.
Did you kiss him back?
He's clearly attracted to you
Do you think he's handsome?
He's not the right guy for you
Jade, take a small gun
Indeed!
They're reading his book
She's just a friend
He's just a friend
You're supposed to be the best
You're supposed to be relaxing
Tom said Mary wouldn't be here
I'm sure everything'll be okay
You're supposed to be resting
You'll always be welcome here
We're supposed to be together
We're checking the whole area
Tom never would've hurt you
You're supposed to be in bed
When Tom saw me, he ran away
I'm on my way to Tom's place
I couldn't decide what to do
How often does Tom come here?
Do you think Tom is handsome?
Do you mind if I try this on?
Are you allergic to anything?
You're not supposed to talk
We are adjourned until 2:30
Is Tom allergic to anything?
How can I turn up the stove?
Could you get me some water?
Can you give me some advice?
You're supposed to say yes
You're supposed to be dead
Tom never would've asked
Tom doesn't smoke or drink
Something's terribly wrong
Should I call an ambulance?
It's obvious that Tom lied
How often do you come here?
You're welcome to join us
You're welcome to join me
Tom kissed you, didn't he?
Is it OK if I go home now?
I can't decide what to do
You're a wonderful woman
Would you like to try it?
We're supposed to relax
Tom died in Mary's arms
Is it OK if I stay here?
We'll accept your deal
Tom didn't get the job
Tom didn't get jealous
What's this made from?
Am I doing this right?
When did the war end?
How much is the rent?
You have until 2:30
Can I help you cook?
Am I doing it right?
What's this called?
What's it good for?
Can we go inside?
How do I do it?
How hot is it?
Do you fish?
Which subject do you prefer?
That's very difficult for us
The rabbit's ear is bleeding
I bet you don't remember me
I'm in position
Tom, do you copy?
I don't like the way you think
What are you doing to me?
And how do you know that?
I don't like this sentence
My boyfriend doesn't know
My girlfriend doesn't know
Come on guys, let's get along!
I'm afraid that's wrong
Don't open your books
It's extremely embarrassing
Where's Rio de Janeiro?
It's in Brazil.
You've written to them
Who did he see?
Where are my glasses?
Please stop!
What are the Germans like?
You think me an idiot?
Is living the goal of life?
Rack off, hairy legs!
Tom, too, was almost killed
Do you know whose this is?
Tom, tell me your email
Fire!
Tom shouted, "There's a fire!
What a stupid question!
What's your email address?
Don't drink too much champagne
He's as big as I am
How's the teaching life?
You're charming today
How beautiful nature made you!
What's up, everybody?
You're Emily
She's Laurie
What should we say?
Tom didn't disagree
It seems I'm falling ill
It's nearly seven o'clock
I went back to sleep.
We're going to be all right
Have I really caught a cold?
This is Tom's tomcat's tomb
That's a gross mistake
You're testing my patience!
The cat says "meow
Should I know anything else?
Really?
I've seen them in the daytime.
Are you serious?
Let's call for the ambulance
She's barely learning
I don't know
Have you been punched?
Tom doesn't have to do it
Tom needn't do it
No language, no nation
It's a sin to say so
What sin is upon us?
Can you give us any advice?
You'll get used to it rapidly
Do you know him?
How does one change his views?
Later, she regretted it
Can we do something?
I'll go change my clothes
Is he correct?
I think he's correct
He's good at swimming
It doesn't have to be that way
This is a hearing, not a trial
Something's not right
I don't waste time
Mary doesn't waste time
I'm also a Jew
Why did he quit smoking?
In fact, it's a mistake
What a scoundrel you are!
That's the way Tom is
You can't do anything about it
Dear, where have you been?
I've been running.
In short, all died out
Can you see the gopher?
No?
Neither can I. But he's here!
It's pointless
Don't treat me like a fool!
Who knows what might happen..
No, it's not necessary
Tom hasn't mentioned you
There's no need to ask
I think we will.
You don't mind, do you?
Of course I don't.
I'm tired of work
What a fatty you are, Tom
Don't talk rot, Tom
Don't get on my nerves!
That's a trifle
Easy to plan, hard to realize
Really?
That's so interesting
Itâ€™s fate
Who wants to ask a question?
He'll take an afternoon nap
Please, speak a little louder
I give the floor to Dr. Tom
I don't need to talk to him
What's to be done next?
Her birthday is May 5th
She isn't a diligent student
By the by, that would be fine
Yes, of course, you are right
That's O.K. with me
Does it suit you?
How do you like Kazan-city?
The faster, the better!
Where are my glasses?
Please stop it!
Let's take a little break
You're not my mom
You're not my mom
It's too early to really tell
What are you doing, you fool!
What will I write about today?
Is the exam over?
How did it go?
Democracy is such a fad!
What is RNA?
Do you know what will happen?
How's everyone doing?
How's this possible?
What did I say yesterday?
Does this even make sense?
Vacation?
What's that?
Don't get any funny ideas
How many phones does she own?
Where can I meet Tom?
Tom!
Are you all right?
They're everywhere!
She moved to Paris in 1906
I'll spend a few days with you
I'd close my eyes
Don't fear being put upon
He can't come because he's ill
I turned 16
He's always trading
May I go now?
Let's drink and sing with joy
If you go, they'll go too
You have become a great man!
Does Tom have insurance?
Does Tom have fire insurance?
Shouldn't Tom be in jail?
Is that a request or an order?
You're not old enough to drink
Tom, you're so cheap!
What text editor do you use?
No way!
I'm not a freak!
I don't exterminate your rats
I don't peel their fruits
I don't manage their company
I don't waste their money
I'm not dancing for you
I'm not sowing your wheat
I'm not working your land
I'm not picking their olives
I'm not covering their pool
I'm not forcing them
I don't like them
I'm not copying your homework
I'm not freezing your food
I'm not counting your money
Why is the police here?
I'm a big fan of Tom
That's actually pretty sad
Do we need to wait for him?
Do we need to wait for Tom?
I'm thankful to be alive
Do you go to a private school?
Two days later, Tom was dead
I think he's handsome
What did Tom say he needed?
What did Tom say he wanted?
What did Tom say he lost?
Here's what you wanted
Is that what you meant?
Isn't that what you expected?
Just what are you insinuating?
Why didn't you remind me?
I shouldn't even care
I'm not heating your house
Are you Mary's husband?
Do you have what we need?
Can you do it or not?
Is that what you think, too?
Isn't that what you wanted?
What ship did he arrive on?
What ship did she arrive on?
What ship did you arrive on?
He's doing very well today
She's doing very well today
She's getting older
That isn't what happened
That's not what happened
That's not what I've heard
That's not what we had in mind
That's not what we want
That's not what you said
That's what everyone's saying
He's known all over the world
You're probably right again
What are you doing for dinner?
I'm very forgetful
It wasn't what we wanted
That's what they were planning
What are your plans for today?
Wasn't that what you intended?
This wasn't what we planned
What are we doing today?
You play golf?
What's your handicap?
What's the plan for today?
Hello, my friend!
That's so inaccurate
You know you want it!
I'm solving a puzzle
What city are you in?
Good night, Tom!
How old are they now?
Who is lurking in the shadows?
He wasn't there
She wasn't there
We weren't there
Mary wasn't there
You believed Tom, didn't you?
Can I ask for a clarification?
Can I ask for an explanation?
Can I ask for an illumination?
Can I ask for an elucidation?
You fired Mary, didn't you?
You found Mary, didn't you?
You know guns, don't you?
This Wednesday I'll see Carla
I'm enjoying the process
You like jazz, don't you?
You like Mary, don't you?
You lost count, didn't you?
You loved Mary, didn't you?
I haven't seen him
Is anyone going tomorrow?
What do you think it is?
What are you after?
What are you contemplating?
What are your qualifications?
What have you observed?
What did you do wrong?
She's a bus driver
OMG!
I didn't know that!
Omigod!
I didn't know that!
Can we go now?
May we go now?
Can we go home?
May we go home?
Did it go well?
Did the concert go well?
Did the meeting go well?
Did the interview go well?
Can't we go now?
Let's go for it
Let's go to lunch
Should we go back?
Should we go help?
It can't be worse than now
I bought this dictionary, too
Can we go upstairs?
Should we go inside?
Let's go to the mall
Let's go in my office
Where did we go wrong?
Do you want to go for a drive?
I've smoked a tear in my lung
Why did you go to Boston?
Can't you go by yourself?
Did you go to the police?
Was it a Sumerian?
Was it a Chinese?
Did you go to college?
Why didn't you go with Tom?
Where does Tom go to school?
Why don't we go for a drive?
Why didn't you go to Boston?
Why didn't you go to school?
Are you going in?
Are we going home?
I'm going with you
Are you going home?
It's going to hurt
It's going to work
Are we going to eat?
Are you going along?
Are you going to go?
Is it going to hurt?
Tom and Mary aren't related
How are we going to do it?
It isn't going to be easy
When are we going to land?
It's nice to meet you too
Can't you go faster?
Can't we go with Tom?
Let go of me, please
Shouldn't Tom go first?
What are we celebrating?
I can't imagine that happening
Is Tom going to jail?
Are you ready to go home?
Do you want to go again?
It's not what it seems
It's not what we expected
Just what were you planning?
Is Tom doing better?
It was Tom's fault, you know
That wasn't what Tom meant
C'mon, let's go!
I'm one-eyed
How much is this clock?
I'll take it home with me
Say "aah.
This is an outright lie!
I'd do anything for you, Tom
What are our plans for today?
This I didn't say
I don't regret what I've done
We'll make the difference
Tom hasn't had much education
I don't want to
How many bags did you have?
Where's your sword?
I don't lie anymore
We're not sure if she's right
You hired Tom, didn't you?
You loved Tom, didn't you?
You need help, don't you?
I've been found guilty
You said that, didn't you?
I looked at Emily's face
I've bought a gift for Emily
Today is Emily's birthday
You will bring Tom, won't you?
Emily can't eat ground meat
I'd like to go out with Emily
You forgave me, didn't you?
I'm feeling sad for Melanie
I'll tell it to Emily
The driver couldn't take it
I can't carry this stone
I got you, rascal!
I'm not making your beds
I'm not strangling your cats
I don't get it either
Your passport, please
Who is the team's coach?
Let everything be forgotten!
You can't escape from me
What's today's plan?
Today I'm pissed
I hope I didn't interrupt you
He's bananas about cleanliness
Rest in peace, father!
It's incorrect
Next Sunday I'll go to a zoo

You considered it, didn't you?
You had breakfast, didn't you?
What's in that smoothie?
Oh Tom, you big, strong man!
Come here and kiss me!
I'm sorry!
I'm married!
This disturbs you, doesn't it?
You're worth less than nothing
It's a cancer of the cervix
Let's call a bus
Lol, what?
That's exactly what happened
My cat wasn't impressed
Wow, this is crazy

His girlfriend was there, too
I'm gonna go cry now
I'm going to go cry now
Don't cut your hair!
I don't want to cut my hair
I don't want to get a haircut

I don't like repeating myself.

What is â€˜The Hunger Gamesâ€™?
I don't know
That's all for now, folks
What does all that mean?
Is all of that necessary?
That's all Tom had to say
What's all the commotion?
It's complicated, isn't it?
Does that make sense?
Could you make an exception?
Does that make a difference?
No, I'm still a bachelor
I won't be ready
What made you suspicious?
What made you say that?
Who made the delivery?
What made you do this?
What made you confess?
What made you do what you did?
What are you making now?
What are you reading now?
How about a hug?
How about a kiss?
How about a song?
How about a contest?
How about a rematch?
How about a sandwich?
I'd like two kilos of onions
I failed to find Mary's house
It's about to get better
It's about something else
It's about time you showed up
What stopped me?
What stopped him?
What stopped her?
What stopped Tom?
What stopped Mary?
What stopped us?
What stopped them?
Who brought me here?
Who brought him?
Who brought you?
Who brought Tom?
Who brought her?
Who brought Mary?
Who brought us here?
Who notified me?
Who notified him?
Who notified her?
Who notified Tom?
Who notified Mary?
Who notified us?
Has Tom been notified?
Have the police been notified?
Why wasn't I notified?
Why wasn't Tom notified?
You're ruining my life
You need a hand, don't you?
Is the night cold agreeable?
I'll just burst into tears
I'm your teacher
He's stark crazy
Mrs. Green taught me English
Do you have a sunscreen?
Its symbol is m/s
I've watched television
Relax when talking to me, boy
I'm not your sister
Everyone's idea is different
You've got some cheek!
I don't like fatty foods
Let's go for a coffee?
He couldn't control his anger
I hope it helps!
I'm pretty hungry!
I've never been robbed
She breast-fed the baby
I'm reading this newspaper
She smiled at a passer-by
She stopped a passer-by
She trusted a co-worker
Can we go for a walk?
Do we have to go there?
Can we go to the circus?
What are you doing this for?
Is that what you mean?
That's what Tom requested
That's what Tom thought
That's what Tom wanted
Are you going to cry?
Are we going to lose?
What's been going on?
Are you going to come?
It's going to be tricky
What can Tom do?
How can we help?
When did Tom get home?
Didn't you get my message?
How would you do that?
Does it make a difference?
That's all we know for sure
Did you know that was there?
Did you know Tom personally?

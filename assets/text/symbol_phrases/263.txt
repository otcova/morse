We're fortunate to be here
Tom's trial isn't over yet
Tom's family must miss him
Tom wouldn't stop fighting
Tom wouldn't stop drinking
Tom wouldn't help us today
Tom wouldn't have a chance
Tom wouldn't do the dishes
Tom won't start doing that
Tom won't see Mary anymore
Tom won't likely kiss Mary
Tom won't let you go there
Tom won't let us help Mary
Tom won't let me help Mary
Tom won't hug Mary anymore
Tom won't do that for Mary
Tom won't be leaving today
Tom wasn't upstairs in bed
Tom wasn't in the basement
Tom shouldn't go with Mary
Tom should've stopped Mary
Tom said he'd do that soon
Tom said Mary wasn't lying
Tom must've studied French
Tom must've seen something
Tom knows that I'm married
Tom knew that I'd be early
Tom knew that I'd be alone
Tom isn't asking for money
Tom is the one who's lying
Tom is Mary's only brother
Tom hasn't taken his pills
Tom hasn't shaved all week
Tom doesn't let Mary drive
Tom doesn't know Mary lied
Tom didn't kiss Mary today
Tom can't let Mary do that
Those sunglasses are Tom's
This wasn't very expensive
This wasn't that expensive
These are Tom's and Mary's
That's what it's all about
That's a bit too expensive
Please don't let Tom drive
It's unlikely Tom will win
It's time for Tom to leave
It's pretty cold, isn't it?
It's going to rain tonight
It's going to be over soon
It's going to be dark soon
Is French taught at school?
I'm sure Tom will be there
I'm not going to apologize
I'm going to get ice cream
I'm glad you're doing that
I'm glad I didn't kiss Tom
I'll give Tom your message
I'd suggest not doing that
I'd really like doing that
I tried to guess Tom's age
I think that's Tom's house
I think that this is Tom's
I left Tom's house at 2:30
I knew that you'd kiss Tom
I hope you didn't kiss Tom
I hope it's sunny tomorrow
I haven't ever lied to you
I don't think I'd kiss Tom
I don't regret kissing Tom
I don't intend to kiss Tom
I don't drink milk anymore
I don't care what Tom buys
I didn't actually kiss Tom
How much sugar do you want?
How much sugar did you buy?
How much salt should I add?
How much milk should I buy?
How much honey did you buy?
How much do we need to pay?
How much candy did you eat?
How much candy did you buy?
How much candy did Tom eat?
How much bread did you eat?
How much bread did you buy?
How much beer should I buy?
How many aunts do you have?
How long did the rain last?
How long did the game last?
Do you still work with Tom?
Do you still live with Tom?
Didn't you hear Tom scream?
Did you make a reservation?
Did you kiss Tom yesterday?
Did Tom drink all the wine?
Can you drive me to school?
Are these Tom's and Mary's?
You'd better let me drive
Would Tom ever lie to you?
Why wouldn't Tom hug Mary?
Why is Tom good at French?
Why is Tom always so busy?
Why don't we go to Boston?
Why doesn't Tom trust you?
Why did you let Tom drive?
Why did Tom join the team?
Who wants to learn French?
Who paid for these drinks?
Where were you in October?
When did you buy this hat?
What's Tom doing up there?
What's Tom doing nowadays?
What time is the last bus?
What a stupid thing to do!
What a rotten thing to do!
We're being very cautious
We won't be here tomorrow
Tom's father punished him
Tom wouldn't let us leave
Tom wouldn't let me drive
Tom wouldn't ever do that
Tom wouldn't do that here
Tom wouldn't ask for help
Tom won't make it on time
Tom won't do that, I hope

Tom isn't getting married
Tom hasn't paid his taxes
Tom has a brand-new truck
Tom doesn't remember much
Tom doesn't need to worry
Tom didn't let Mary drive
Tom didn't get much sleep
There's bread in the oven
Talking to Tom won't help
My flight arrived at 2:30
Maybe it'll rain tomorrow
Mary might be Tom's niece
Let's go horseback riding
It's pretty hot, isn't it?
It's nice here in the sun
It's going to take months
It's been snowing all day
Is your father's name Tom?
I've never seen Tom naked
I'm tired of lying to Tom
I'm not going to kiss Tom
I'm not at liberty to say
I'm glad Tom will help us
I'm already pretty sleepy
I'll be thirty in October
I'd never let Tom kiss me
I'd never ever lie to you
I told Tom we'd help Mary
I met Tom at Mary's house
I don't like French class
I don't know why Tom lied
I don't care what you buy
I can't believe it myself

How much milk did you buy?
How much jam should I buy?
How much honey do we have?
How much food did you buy?
How much cake did you eat?
How much cake did Tom eat?
How much beer did you buy?
How many dogs do you have?
Don't tell Tom where I am
Don't give Tom my address
Do you still work for Tom?
Didn't you see Tom's face?
Did Tom drink all of that?
Could Tom have lied to us?
Could I see your passport?
You should've hugged Tom
Would you like a receipt?
Why were you so offended?
Why was Tom hugging Mary?
Why didn't Tom kiss Mary?
Why are you back so soon?
Who told Tom to hug Mary?
Who did Tom say hit Mary?
Where were you on Monday?
What's the matter, honey?
What do think about that?
What did you and Tom eat?
Were you speaking French?
We're running out of air
We won't ever lie to you
Tom's wife must miss him
Tom's car is really nice
Tom wouldn't tell me why
Tom wouldn't let me talk
Tom wouldn't let Mary go
Tom wouldn't leave early
Tom won't wait that long
Tom won't try to do that

Tom doesn't care anymore
Tom didn't want to argue

Tom and Mary didn't kiss
Those children are Tom's
This isn't Tom's picture
The weather's been great
My French isn't that bad
It's going to take hours
It's going to snow today
It wasn't worth the risk
It isn't snowing anymore
It isn't raining anymore
It didn't cost that much
I'm sure today is Monday
I'm still in high school
I'm not really very busy
I'm happy with the price
I'm already pretty tired
I'll have to talk to Tom
I'd love a cup of coffee
I won't kiss Tom anymore
I won't be home tomorrow
I think Tom won't resign
I haven't yet kissed Tom
I don't kiss Tom anymore
I didn't really kiss Tom
How much pie did you eat?
How much pie did Tom eat?
How much jam did you buy?
How much food do we have?
How do you think you did?
How did you become blind?
How can we join the team?
How about doing that now?
Does Tom think Mary lied?
Did you actually hug Tom?
Did you actually kiss Tom?
Did Tom eat all the stew?
Boston is where I'm from
You can't do that today
Would you ever kiss Tom?
Why won't Tom kiss Mary?
Why were you handcuffed?
Why should Tom hug Mary?
Why is Tom still single?
Why is Tom so exhausted?
Why is Tom back so soon?
Why didn't you kiss Tom?
Why didn't Tom hug Mary?
Why did you talk to Tom?
Why are you up so early?
Who paid for the coffee?
Where did Tom meet Mary?
What's that awful noise?
What does the label say?
What did you and Tom do?
What are you doing, Tom?
What a mean thing to do!
We're both the same age

Tom won't help, will he?
Tom won't help us today

That's not what Tom did
I'll be back
It's past Tom's bedtime
Isn't Tom in Boston now?
Is your name really Tom?
Is Tom really your boss?
Is Mary your girlfriend?
I'm already pretty busy
I'll buy a new umbrella
I'd never let Tom drive
I'd drive if Tom let me
I won't ever lie to you
I wish you'd stop lying
I think it'll rain soon
I never thought I'd win
I don't like that stuff
I didn't ask Tom to lie
How much coffee is left?
How much butter is left?
How could Tom lie to us?
How can I join the team?
How are you two related?
Have you found your key?
Has Tom eaten lunch yet?
Finding Tom wasn't easy
Can you fix this or not?
Can Tom stay for dinner?
Are you saying Tom lied?
You must be Tom's wife
Will you let Tom drive?
Why would Tom hug Mary?
Why won't Tom hug Mary?
Why don't you kiss Tom?
Why are you so unhappy?
Whose gloves are those?
Who knows why Tom lied?
Where is French spoken?
When did Tom meet Mary?
When did Tom kiss Mary?
What did you buy today?
We've learned a lesson
We've both lied to you
We're not lying to you
We wouldn't lie to you

Tom didn't win a medal
Tom didn't let me talk
Tom didn't go very far
Tom admitted he'd lied
Those horses are Tom's
Those gloves are Tom's
Nice weather, isn't it?
Is Tom married to Mary?
I've had all I can eat
I'm sure Tom will help
I'm going to leave Tom
I won't kiss Tom today
I won't kiss Tom again
I should've hugged Tom
I hope Tom isn't lying
I didn't let Tom drive
How much water is left?
How much honey is left?
How much candy is left?
How much bread is left?
Did you hurt your knee?
You're not to do that
Would you like a pillow?
Why is Tom so unlucky?
Why is Tom so grouchy?
Why is Tom so excited?
Why is Tom so annoyed?
Why did Tom kiss Mary?
Why are you skeptical?
Whose horses are those?
When did you kiss Tom?
We're thinking of you
Tom's mother is dying

Tom won't forget that
Tom says he won't die
Tom left work at 2:30
Tom isn't on duty now
Tom isn't in his tent
Tom isn't dating Mary
Tom can't change that
Those boots are Tom's
That's not what I did
So, what do we do now?
May I kiss Mary today?
I'm very sorry I lied
I'm heading to Boston
I'm headed for Boston
I'm doing Tom a favor
I won't let you drive
I won't let Tom drive
I knew you'd kiss Tom
I can't let you drive
How old is this bread?
How much wine is left?

Tom won't go with us
Tom won't catch Mary
Tom isn't home a lot
Tom hugged Mary, too
Tom fixed Mary's car
That umbrella's mine
Should I wake Tom up?
May I kiss you again?
It's stopped snowing
It's past my bedtime
It's nice in the sun
It's going to be hot
I'm still in college
I'll sweep the floor
I'd never lie to you
How much pie is left?
Didn't Tom kiss Mary?
Can we join the team?
Can I kiss you again?
Would Tom lie to us?
Why is Tom so upset?

That's a bit pricey
Let's go home early
Let's go have lunch
Is Tom your husband?
I've injured myself
I'm not kidding you
Don't let Tom drive
Can I join the team?
Are you missing Tom?
Why is Tom so slow?
Why are you sleepy?
Who paid for lunch?
Who let the dog in?
We're still eating
We're invited, too
Tom's dog has died
Tom won't leave us
Tom won't be happy
Tom can't stop now
Tell Tom I'm tired
It's going to heal
It's going to burn
I'm really thirsty
I'm really nervous
I'll let you drive
I'll let Tom drive
Why are you early?
Tom wouldn't care
Tom won't risk it
Tom won't make it
Tom won't hurt us
Tom won't hurt me
Tom won't confess
Tom might've died
It's a bit chilly
Is Mary your wife?
How disappointing!
Does Tom eat meat?
Could I get a hug?
Why is Tom early?
Who's that woman?
Tom wouldn't eat
Tom wouldn't cry
Tom won't see me
Tom won't say no
Tom won't resign
Tom won't object
Tom won't change
Tom must've died
Tom didn't leave
That book's mine
It's a good sign
I won't kiss Tom
I didn't hug Tom
Tom won't lose
Tom won't help
It's a big job
I'm not a poet
Tom won't die
You've lost
Where did the snake bite you?
Just here on my leg.
My life isn’t your problem
I don't want your excuse
Let's go to my apartment
Sami came into Layla's life
Sami messed up Layla's life
Sami doesn't remember the rest
Sami saw Layla in Farid's arms
He's not my son
I think I'm pregnant again
You know what?
You're beautiful
See what I've got for you
That's kind of you, Doctor.
It's only a personal opinion
How long do we have to wait?
You are already dead!
Hey, look at me!
Do you love me?
Yes, with all my heart.
He's a thug.
Don't call him that.
I won't be insulted like this
I don't owe Sami anything
Your wife has a lover.
You bet.
That doesn't explain a lot
I'm carrying Sami's baby
You're a human sewer
Why did you start drinking?
Sami shouldn't die so soon
I'm not married
I mean, not anymore
How else should I take it?
You and I can't have a future
I can't betray my wife
What do you like doing alone?
And who was the other?
Geez, it's late
You know I love Mary, right?
Give me a pilsner!
Is your horse black?
Are you hungry?
Stay with me!
I opened the box; it was empty
Who are you?
I'm Tom.
Is that your best price?
This rug is 100% silk
Go get 'em tiger!
It's okay
It's only me
It's okay, Tom
It's only me
It's okay
It's just me
Your mother was pregnant then.
With me?
Yes.
Layla is pregnant.
By me?
That's what she said.
Layla isn't carrying my child
Do you still fancy me?
Do you still find me nice?
Where are you two going?
Sami's job there is finished
What did Sami's friend want?
This is a truth you don't know
You're my life, Son
You're my reason for living
Sami is good at hide-and-seek
You can't walk out on me
I'm praying for Sami
Sami isn't taking the blame
This is Sami's responsibility
Is there another route?
Here is your ticket, Sir
I miss Layla's gentle touch
You're now part of my life
Did you see the news today?
What are you talking about?
Are you on drugs?
We have to cross the mountain?
Sami just obeys Layla's orders
What about our safety?
What about our future?
Yeah, empty promises.
Can you cross that river?
I'll help you cross the river
We need to cross the river.
How about the horses?
Who is the goddess of love?
Do you miss your mother?
Do they miss their mother?
Sami doesn't know this place
Thanks a lot for your help.
Have a nice day.
Man can't control nature
Sami asked for Layla's help
Sami prayed in Layla's room
Can we pray in your room?
Sami isn't an extremist
Sami isn't a fanatic
Sami saw Layla's YouTube video
Sami didn't have any beliefs
Sami didn't like any religion
Sami needed God's guidance
Sami's Muslim name is Abdullah
It didn't sound right to me
Christians don't go to mosques
Sami's cellmate was Muslim
How do you feel?
Better.
Do you like waffles?
Tom's career was over
Tom's career is over
Sami can't stay here
Sami won't run away
I'm having Sami's child
You're sweating rivers
Please don't be so sad
She's all yours
Rape her, if you want.
Shut up, you bastard!
They can't arrest me.
Shut your mouth!
You haven't seen anything yet
Sami didn't feel Christian
Sami's mother was Muslim
Sami doesn't eat pork
Sami killed Layla's child
Sami didn't know many Muslims
Sami's dream is impossible
Sami is Layla's partner
Layla is Sami's assistant
Sami won't die
Sami is Layla's boyfriend
Sami doesn't seem well
Sami doesn't know what to say
Layla was Sami's wife
Sami isn't excusing Layla
Sami hasn't heard from Layla
Sami couldn't believe that
Sami's house was upside down
Sami didn't have an income
Sami needed Layal's advice
Sami shouldn't come near Layla
Sami can't go out like this
Sami shouldn't go out now
Sami shouldn't go outside
Sami wants what's best for you
Sami isn't feeling well
Sami didn't take anything
Sami didn't ask anybody else
Sami isn't so sure
Layla isn't Sami's wife
Sami is Layla's boss
Sami shouldn't say that
Sami won't tolerate this
Sami won't do this to Layla
Sami didn't even ask why
Sami's radio broke down
Sami's radio is useless
Sami hasn't appeared
Sami shouldn't waste any time
Sami didn't have many options
Sami can't go in
Sami couldn't stand that noise
Sami didn't read the newspaper
Sami said that to Layla's face
Sami left Layla's office
Sami didn't say too much
I am breast-feeding my son
Life is like that!
How's your knee?
That's a fair criticism
We'll always have Paris
Is Tom a good guy?
Don't you even dare call me
You make the toast.
To our love.
Don't abandon me
I can't believe that
I'm begging a man to love me
Are we getting a divorce?
Layla..
I can't believe that..
I just can't believe that
I know you're not a slut
Sorry I'm late.
Don't worry
It's not a problem.
I'm divorcing Sami
He half-inches all sorts
What did they nick from you?
What did they pinch from you?
What did they steal from you?
Who's nicked my hairdryer?
Who's pinched my hairdrier?
Who's stolen my hairdryer?
Mum!
What are you doing on the car?
Get down right now!
We'll drink it this evening
Turn off the light, please
It doesn't seem like much
You're not a cat, are you?
Please, don't kill me!
Are you a cat?
Skip the intro, please
Are you an alien?
Now, breathe out
Sami can't move anymore
Sami can't go any further
Sami can't move an inch
Sami can't walk anymore
Sami's journey ends here
Sami's dignity is gone
Sami can't make it
Sami flattered Layla's ego
Sami listened to Layla's tapes
Sami's words cut deep
It's a chilly morning
Mmm, but you must wait for me
I don't know the exact date
My son's in the third grade
Maybe that's what I'll do
I'll be coming within an hour
Sami's home was unlocked
My fathers don't speak Dutch
My mothers don't speak Dutch
Now I want to know!
We'll have to travel light
Where is the laundromat?
I'm running out of Euros
Don't dress like a tourist
I love Lebanese food!
Who's this motherfucker?
Fuck you, motherfucker
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I can't help it
Why are you wiggling so much?
It tickles.
The doctor checked Sami's eyes
I'll let Sami in anyway
I'm afraid you're sick
It doesn't look good.
I'm afraid it doesn't.
It's time you went to bed, too
This is Sami's pillow
It's not my fault I was sick
Phooey on the math test!
I can't go to school
I can't go home
I'm a wanted criminal
Have you got a moment?
How's the game going?
Don't touch the candy
Can I speak to Tom, please?
I'm sorry, he just left.
Let's dance in the rain
Not if a friend helps you.
What's the rake for?
Sami loved Layla's cookies
Sami's cookies taste terrible
Sami likes Layla's cookies
Sami's cookies are awful
Sami asked for Layla's opinion
Sami fixed Layla's bicycle
Sami didn't like cookies
Sami's show was a disaster
Sami's lunch is in the car
Sami is Layla's little brother
Sami didn't know what to say
Sami didn't hear anyone
Sami didn't want to hear that
Sami can't please everybody
Sami's bike is all wet
Sami's bike isn't ready
Sami didn't mind waiting
Sami just didn't get a chance
Sami made orange juice, too
Sami doesn't blame Layla
Sami doesn't like soccer
Sami doesn't envy Layla
Sami tasted Layla's pie
When will you have holidays?
Tom was half-asleep
Can birds smell?
Do birds fart?
How come you are so slow?
What was that thing?
It's very sad
Are you working late tonight?
Let's sit down somewhere
She wasn't amused
Someone's texting me
I'll look for a bandage
Tom's phone buzzed
Mary's phone buzzed
How do you know about that?
You told me.
I'll have what you're having
I know Tom won't believe me
I know Tom won't believe me.
I don't believe you either.
I didn't know they were dating
Can you take a photo of us?
Then, we started crying
I love you, my goddess!
I'm not blocking you
I'm not blockading you
Sami didn't show up at all
Sami showed up at Layla's home
Sami's bus was late
Police verified Sami's alibi
Can you walk on it?
How did you fall down there?
Is he ill?
Where is his ID?
Where are the pickles?
Do you expect me to pay?
You'd expect more..
Another gas pipeline war?
Is this goat cheese?
You've never seen this before!
I don't like the way he laughs
What a horrible thing war is!
You're a hundred percent right
It's a new bike
What a nice bike!
Sami wants to go, too
The thing is, my cat is shy
In all likelihood, I will win
Quack, quack!" the duck said
It didn't not work
He's going into shock
Well, this is a fine mess..
Where's the chips and dip?
Sami can't have a cookie now
It's supper time
Bill doesn't smoke anymore
Sami likes Layla's idea better
Sami didn't see Layla all day
Sami doesn't have any money
Elvis is alive!
Sami didn't have a plan
How is Emily?
Mr. Brown teaches us English
Let he who loves me follow me!
Sami dialled 911
Has Sami taken any drugs?
Sami re-enrolled in college
Sami's heart was hit
You don't speak a lot
Where is Tom?
He is sick.
Let's continue tomorrow!
The jury doesn't believe Sami
Sami drives an old pick-up
Sami's affair ended months ago
Happy Birthday Tom!
I'm really glad to hear that
Sami's life changed overnight
Are you Sami's bitch?
No!
Where else should I be?
You laugh too much!
a⨯b can be abbreviated as ab
What's the weather tomorrow?
October 1st is Citizen's Day
He tells me, "Danger!
She can't eat brownies
I think I'm love with you
We'll make it through
I give up - tell me the answer
An imposter!
You don't go to our school
Heavens!
I call shotgun!
Can you walk the dog?
Are these dishes clean?
Did the dog poop?
Did you lock the doors?
Is this recyclable?
I'll have a Bloody Mary
Let's skip lunch
Can you stop fidgeting?
What happened to your muscles?
That's not its intended use
Blessings to all earthlings!
You don't want my money?
Is this an issue?
Because it's impractical
And the issue is?
Back 'er up!
I'm bloated
He knew all of the cat's names
Not another outburst!
Zip it!
Not another word!
Why do you follow me?
b_n converges to b
[Amen]
You can't wear sweatpants
Follow that tornado!
What the hell is a juice box?
What are they all looking at?
Sami's life was chaotic
Sami is having an affair.
Are you sure, Layla?
Sami has stolen Layla's life
Sami's hair has changed
How can I change that?
Will this change anything?
Have you got change?
How did Sami change you?
Sami changed Layla's life
Sami's door was unlocked
Sami didn't change anything
Keep the change.
Thank you.

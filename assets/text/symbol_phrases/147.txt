And is your noise Gaussian?
And what are we doing now?
Why are you studying Italian?
She's better looking than me
He's better looking than me
I'm starting with beer
Is this water okay to drink?
I wouldn't count on it
Tom's mind couldn't be changed
I don't wear makeup at all
She doesn't wear makeup
Don't watch too much TV
That's lame
They shouldn't trust Tom
He's mowing his lawn
He's wearing a kilt
I just can't solve it
Did you phone Tom?
Nothing's perfect
He's a poor student
She's a poor student
I'm just a poor student
He's artsy
She's artsy
She doesn't wear thongs
She's a superstar
She's having suicidal thoughts
The water is waist-deep
Look!
Thanks, this is enough
Stop looking at me!
May I borrow it?
I don't know who killed Tom
I don't know who my mother is
I don't know who Tom is
I don't know why I did it
I don't know why Tom is here
I don't know why Tom went away
I don't know
Why don't you ask Tom?
I don't know
I don't like being cheated
I don't like being on my own
I don't like horror movies
I don't like it when you swear
I don't like oatmeal cookies
I don't like the sound of that
I don't like the way I look
I don't like to talk about Tom
I don't like Tom and Mary
I don't like what we've become
I don't make the schedule
I don't need a car that big
I don't need that kind of help
I don't need to go to college
I don't need to talk about it
I don't need to talk to Tom
I don't need to talk to you
I don't need to write it down
I don't quite know what to say
He's clearly intelligent
Our plan didn't work
I don't really know Tom at all
I don't really like Tom anyway
I don't see that as a problem
I don't see your name on it
I don't think any of them know
I don't think I can do that
I don't think I can eat this
I don't think I can help you
I don't think I should do that
I don't think it's a good idea
I don't think it's a wolf
I don't think it's dangerous
I don't think it's Tom's fault
I don't think it's your fault
I don't think my life is easy
I don't think that's an option
I don't think this is for you
I don't think Tom can hear me
I don't think Tom even saw me
I don't think Tom hates you
I don't think Tom is Canadian
I don't think Tom likes Mary
I don't think Tom likes you
I don't think Tom will be back
I don't think we did it right
I don't think we have a choice
I don't think you should do it
I don't want any more food
I don't want pizza
I'm not hungry
I don't want to be famous
I don't want to be with you
I don't want to cause a panic
I don't want to drive
I don't want to get divorced
I don't want to walk home
I don't want Tom in my house
I don't want Tom to find Mary
I don't want Tom to see this
My alarm didn't go off
That's why I was late
He's very clean
She's very clean
You're very clean
The girls don't like you
Why do ya trash people?
You won't be punished
I doubt if it'll rain
I doubt if it'll snow
That's all for now!
He's a bureaucrat
It's inhumane
I drove Tom's Prius once
I eat only when I'm hungry
I enjoy Tom's company
When will you arrive?
I can't see the difference
I fail to see what's so funny
I don't see what's so funny
I don't see what's so amusing
I feel like I'm going mad
I feel like I'm losing my mind
I figured I'd be safe here
I figured I'd find you here
I figured Tom wouldn't come
I figured you weren't coming
I figured you wouldn't come
I figured you'd be here
I figured you'd be impressed
I figured you'd understand
Whose photo is this?
I followed Tom's orders
Can you drive me home?
He's a misfit
She's beautiful, but arrogant
I found my hat in Tom's car
I found Tom's diary
She's a midwife
I'm not entirely sure
He's a practical man
She's a hair stylist
Don't be a couch potato
Don't be such a couch potato
You're such a couch potato
We're all bound to die
Is she still here?
Are you still here?
I'm still at school
I gave one to Tom, too
I gave Tom Mary's phone number
This can't be avoided
I get off work at 2:30
I get what you're saying
I go to school here, too
I go where I'm told to go
I got here at 2:30
I guess anything's possible
I guess I don't agree with you
I guess I just don't get it
I guess I just wasn't thinking
I guess I shouldn't complain
I guess I'd better be going
I guess I'll be going now
I guess I'll stay a while
I guess I'm a little curious
I guess I'm a little late
I guess I'm a little nervous
I guess I'm a little scared
I guess I'm not that hungry
I guess I've been better
I guess I've been too busy
I guess I've gotten lazy
I guess it's a secret
I guess it's not that easy
I guess it's OK
I guess it's only fair
I guess it's only natural
I guess it's possible
I guess it's time for me to go
I guess that's all I need
I guess that's how I'd do it
I guess that's OK
I guess that's possible
I guess that's right
I guess that's true
I guess that's what I'll do
I guess that's why I love you
I guess Tom isn't at home
I guess we can't say no
I guess we'd better get going
I guess we're finished
I guess we're not invited
I guess you didn't talk to Tom
I guess you weren't there
It's all about money
What would you like him to do?
Take them off me!
Take them off me!
We don't
I had a feeling you'd say that
I had a good time, too
I had no idea you'd be here
I had to amputate Tom's leg
I had to do it before 2:30
I had to respect Tom's wishes
I hadn't considered that
I hadn't planned to tell you
I hadn't really noticed
I hadn't seen Tom in years
I hadn't thought about that
I hadn't thought of that
It doesn't have a battery!
I'm not a teacher
Hi!
Good morning!
I'm not undressing you
It didn't cause nightmares
I'm not planting their trees
I'm going to learn German
It's a cliche, but it's true
Do you have his phone number?
Do you have her phone number?
That's what I love about you
That's what I love about him
That's what I love about her
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about him
That's what I like about her
What would you like her to do?
You were there, right?
What are you saying?!
I hate being a preacher's son
I hate it when you're right
I hate Tom's guts
I hate what I've become
It's a niche product
It's a niche market
She's a pacifist
The sky's the limit
Don't play games with me!
I think she's jealous of you
He's all yours
I'm not interested in him
I'm not interested in her
He's a skirt-chaser
What will you do now?
That's how it is done
That's so random
He's tight with money
Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate
Beliefs become reality.'
Are you afraid to die?
He's wearing long johns
Let's have a minute of silence
Let's have a moment of silence
What did you say?
I can't hear you
I'm falling behind schedule
I think I'm falling asleep
I'm not falling for that again
I've fallen in love with you
Suddenly, I heard shouting
Which room do you live in?
No Entry!
No Smoking!
Happy birthday, Tom!
That's not a valid argument
It's a logical fallacy
I'll gouge out your eyes!
That's the eject button
Don't touch it
She's a soloist
It's a seductive idea
He's an Ashkenazi Jew
He's a Sephardic Jew
I think he's telling the truth
She's an Ivy League graduate
I'm looking for Natsuko
He's not home yet
I can't wait to hear it
Would you have known that?
Do you like Mozart?
It's a free country
Are you interested in the job?
She's up to her neck in debt
He's a bit older than me
She's a bit younger than me
He's a bit younger than me
She's a bit older than me
You are so white!
He's very smart
He's a good-looking guy
She's a good-looking girl
She's disorganized
I wasn't making fun of you
What does it look like to you?
He's a real friend
She's a real friend
You're a real friend
I'm not mad at you
You've got the wrong idea
Who started this rumor?
Can I borrow your brush?
You're going to pay for this
Is your daughter blind?
Which cross do you see?
Which cup do you see?
He's older than her father
He's older than your father!
The sign said: "Beware of dog
Where's the receipt?
It's hard to convince Jonathan
It's hard to persuade Jonathan
She's daring, that girl!
I don't want to tell him that
Originally, French was slang
I'm not invited to parties
She's not invited to parties
It's okay
I want to cry!
Is your mum at home?
How do you feel?
No complaints.
How are you doing, Mary?
Cast your vote for me!
Don't cry
It's okay
I'm sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
It's all my fault!
What's the matter?
I'll leave tomorrow
He'll leave in an hour
Hi!
Are you ok?
Is it too early for red wine?
Capital creates space-time
Can I have some tea?
Could I get some tea?
Could I drink some more tea?
He doesn't have a job
How many are you?
How many are you?
I'm a patient
Are you allowed to go?
A horse!
A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!
He'll have a dog
You're so evil!
Do you have what it takes?
Does he have what it takes?
Does she have what it takes?
April Fool's!
Where is the stage door?
Where is spring?
Are you sure there's no way?
Seriously, I'm pretty angry!
So that's what it is
So that's how it is
Please do not disturb!
So you're her brother!
The printer's acting up again!
I didn't see you drunk
Anyone up for a game of poker?
You're even taller than I am
There wasn't a single survivor
Are you also from Kashgar?
Are you from Kashgar as well?
The car is old, but it is good
We are in a pretty scrape!
I'm hungry
How about you?
Mommy, I have a tummy ache
Let's order Chinese takeout
We must hide!
He's a dirty old man
He's a mycologist
Don't feed wild animals
What's the secret ingredient?
It's a lie and a falsehood
What do you call your dog?
We can't drink milk
Let's listen
I'm very short
May I call later?
Did you turn the stove off?
May I touch them?
You or I?
Why isn't your sister good?
I live in Riber√£o Preto
It looks really hard!
I stood up, but not for long
Which one is you?
Did you stand up?
He doesn't dare to say a thing
Try hard to hold it tight!
True or false?
What a beauty!
Well I never!
You're a nice one!
That guy is two-faced
You've grown fat
It's a tricky business
I'll have sushi
I'm going to wash my carriage
Most people are right-handed
It's the talk of the town
I'll hold you to that
You're gonna love this
It's pouring down
Hey you!
Up here!
What can I get rid of?
I couldn't find my wallet
I didn't mean to snap at you

I've had a look around
I've had a look
I've had a lot of fun
I've had a lot of practice
I've had a lousy day
I've had a real bad day
I've had a really hard day
I've had a very long day
I've had better days
I've had better vacations
I haven't had dinner
I've had enough for one day
I've had enough of this place
I've had enough of this
I've had enough of your help
I've had it with Tom
I've had it with you
I haven't had lunch
I haven't had my breakfast yet
I've had similar feelings
I've had the same problem
I've had this for years
I've had this happen before
I've had time to practice
I haven't had time
I've heard all this before
I haven't heard anything
I haven't heard from Tom yet
I haven't heard from Tom
I've heard from Tom
I've heard it all before
I've heard of you
I've heard that name before
I've heard that sound before
I've heard that story already
I've heard this before
I've helped many people
I've hurt my ankle
I've invited Tom to dinner
I've invited Tom to join us
I've just come from there
I've just seen the results
I've known that all along
I've known that for a while
I've known Tom a long time
I've known Tom all his life
I've known Tom all my life
I've known Tom for 13 years
I've known Tom for years
I've known Tom his whole life
I've known Tom my whole life
I've known you for a long time
I've learned a lot about Tom
I've learned from the best
I've learned my lesson
I've left Tom three messages
I've let everybody down
I've let Tom down
I've lived a full life
I've lived a long time
I've lived here all my life
I've locked the door
I've lost everything
I've lost feeling in my legs
I've lost my appetite
I've lost my job
I've lost my passport
I've lost my umbrella
I've lost the will to live
I've made a decision
I've made a horrible mistake
I've made a lot of enemies
I haven't made a mistake yet
I've made a mistake
I haven't made much progress
I've made my position clear
I've made some decisions
I've made some mistakes
I've made some progress
I've made that quite clear
I've made things worse
I've made this mistake before
I've made Tom wait long enough
I've met the perfect woman
I've met Tom a few times
I haven't met Tom yet
I've met you before
I've misplaced my keys
I've misplaced my wallet
I've missed so much
I've missed you so much
I've never actually met Tom
I've never been arrested
I've never been camping
I've never been dumped before
I've never been good at French
I've never been good at this
I've never been here before

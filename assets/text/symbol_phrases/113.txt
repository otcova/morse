Which house do you live in?
Let's go to a concert together
He's got a broad Scouse accent
Resist resistance!
Don't call?
No no, call of course!
Are you in immediate danger?
The concert wasn't very good
The party wasn't much fun
Who am I?
Where do I come from?
Is there life after death?
So what's your problem?
What's Tom like?
What's the matter with Tom?
Tom isn't much of a drinker
Tom didn't shoot anybody
Tom didn't feel like waiting
Let's cut Tom some slack
I don't see Tom often
I don't see Tom much
I don't see Tom a whole lot
Has Tom ever been married?
Does Tom have a girlfriend?
You can't take it with you
Help!
I'm drowning!
I'll do what I can to help you
You've got no class
You ain't seen nothing yet
It ain't over till it's over
Two out of three ain't bad
I like TATOEBA very much!
Never in a lifetime!
Bloody hell!
Stop it!
Do I have to use ink?
Do I have to write with ink?
I spent 10 dollars on it
It cost me 10 dollars
I don't care what he says
I wish I had solar-powered car
I'm going to sleep now
We got used to late-hour work
It's my book
Any milk or sugar?
We don't like rain
Who taught you to dance?
I have to see him.
Why?
Life's not easy
Who did you give the book to?
Who does the bell toll for?
Who discovered the island?
I don't buy that
Who was this window broken by?
Who was this poem written by?
Who did you talk to?
Who did you talk with?
Who did you speak with?
She couldn't have said that
Can I stay at your house?
I don't have a place to go
I don't have secrets with you
God, listen to me!
Close the damn door!
Close the damned door!
Close the fucking door!
How are you not sleeping?
I'm not a Nazi!
I'm going there now
Do you go often?
If so, what should we do?
Why do I have to do it?
Ah, crap
I think I'd like to marry her
I'd like to kiss you
Don't blame the messenger
Can I touch your boobs?
Is your gun loaded?
Why are you all dressed up?
Stick it to the Man!
I'm forty years old
She has 2,000 books
It's boring to stay at home
It's Tom I want to meet
Tom is honest, so I like him
I don't fancy that idea
Can I take a picture here?
This cat is brown-colored
He hasn't arrived yet
What do I need to do now?
I don't like this idea at all
Who will you give the book to?
Were you out?
It's time to plan ahead
Well, it's getting late

May I take pictures here?
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Let's take a short rest here
I'll try my best today, too
He's buying an old hat
I don't mind walking
Don't worry about it
It's not your problem
I haven't been to Paris yet
He's just arrived
Promise me you'll be good
I have to study, too
Let's eat now
I'm starving
How are you doing?
I'm doing okay.
How are you doing?
Not bad.
Careful!
It's totally dark outside
It's dark outside
It's pitch black outside

You're in Europe!
I can't imagine that
Where is the school?
We're moving house next month
He isn't able to buy a car
He can't buy a car
Your friend is a namby-pamby
I'm going to the cinema
When are you in Munich?
You can't be a woman
Are you back home now?
Remember "Wacky Races"?
What's the square root of 100?
Is there anything between you?
Do you want a drink?
No, thanks
I'm driving.
We know you're the thief
She's from Somalia
In my opinion, you're wrong
It's nine-thirty
I found it!
Can you repair my shoes?
Wild!
Remember Lockerbie!
Don't try the patience of God!
May a hundred flowers bloom!
Don't try God's patience

Am I in your way?
Are you her pimp?
I hate my mother-in-law
I've put my mobile on silent
Hello Mr Magpie!
How's your wife?
You're a racist
He's such a cold fish
I don't believe him
Do you want also the bucket?
Can't you move faster?
Hurry up, please!
Forget about your wives!
It's a vicious circle
The leaves are yellow!
It's second-hand
That party was a disaster!
You are on the air!
He gets on my nerves!
I've met that girl before
Where are the apples?
He's fit for the loony bin
What a cock-up!
I don't feel sorry for her
They're only crocodile tears
Be realistic!
She's not coming back
Come on, get a move on!
I don't want to be late
Turn that music down!
It's getting on my nerves
Hands off those chocolates!
They are mine!
I can't stand her any longer!
It wasn't my fault
Do you know this song?
Let's play hide-and-seek!
Nothing to add!
In a word, she is guilty
Amy, you should marry him!
This movie is a must!
Toby can't tell jokes
What does this sentence mean?
He's a newcomer
It was pitch-black
You're off your trolley!
Does this make any sense?
Does this make sense?
Does this sentence make sense?
Does what Tom said make sense?
It's a matter of either-or
It's not an either/or matter
Where's the nearest bus stop?
Where's the closest bus stop?
I wonder what he's up to
I'm a shutterbug
No U-turn!
Are you being serious?
We'd like you to sing a song
Someone farted.
It wasn't me!
Do you know him that much?
I haven't washed my hair
This sure tastes good!
Is death the only way out?
Do you know Tom well?
How well do you know Tom?
I'm not quite sure
Are you awake?
Shove off!
I'm busy!
Goodnight!
She is HIV-infected
Do you speak Latin?
May I ask you a favour?
Oh!
Go on!
What do you want from me?
Are you out to get me or what?
I'll be back by six
I didn't say it like that
I'm at the library
Bring your student ID!
Why does everybody love cats?
What is wrong with you people?
How could this be?
Today I'll cut it
Like it or not, you must do it
I can't agree with you
Tremble, you sentences!
I don't have a lot of money
Want to come with?
I'm waiting for my friend
I can't speak Japanese
That's a table
I'm in the rear car
I'm in the caboose
May I dance with you?
I'd like a pop
I'd like a soda
Who will foot the bill?
You've missed the boat
We've missed the boat
He's missed the boat
She's missed the boat
They've missed the boat
I don't know where I should go
Don't talk to me anymore
Don't leave the TV on
This is the next one!
Don't make abrupt moves
They say I'm retarded
Have you already eaten supper?
Have you eaten supper yet?
I'll take a cup of tea
Can we catch the train?
But what is it that I am?
When is the paper due?
Never believe him, he's a liar
How is your last name written?
Ishmael, come over here!
Really smart, that Sphinx!
I'm too tired to drive
May I put it here?
Would you lend me a pencil?
Could I borrow a pencil?
I don't mind the cold
I don't mind the heat
Would you like some popcorn?
It's also usually healthier
Why not love one's own wife?
We even love others'
It's somehow warm
I don't mind if it's hot
I couldn't find it anywhere
Let's face the reality!
Tom!
Even both!" she reproached Tom
Tom, desperate, howled: "Mary!
“Tom!”
“Mary!”
No wonder Mary dumped him!
He can't help you
I don't think he can help you
Tom!
Mary?
Bye, Sayoko!
I don't have anything to say
What happened?
Are you ready?
Here's a gold coin
How do you write "pretty"?
Is it your fault or ours?
Good day!

I missed you!
Come, write your name down
Don't forget to close the door
Excuse me, is this seat free?
Isn't there a pharmacy nearby?
Is there a pharmacy nearby?
I'm coming back

Which are the best ones?
Today the sea was warm!
How can you not know?
My father isn't at home
Piss off!
Here's your bag
What's happening in the cave?
I'm curious.
I have no idea.
This table's surface is smooth
It's warm and cozy here
Turn the music up!
You're pretty
I'm lost
Could you please help me?
I can't play chess yet
I can't open the door
Do you have the key?
Are you crazy?
How are you feeling lately?

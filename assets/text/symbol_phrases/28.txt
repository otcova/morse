Was anyone in that room?
Was there anyone in that room?

Tom's always got a plan B
Where are you now, love?
It's cold outside
What are you frying?
What are you frying there?
What do you use it for?
That's your train
It's like that sometimes
Sometimes it's like that
Can you say it like that?
Can it be said like that?
Can it be put like that?
If you want to go home, go

They're still there?
I'm liking this game
You told Tom, right?
How's this?
The zipper's broken
What are you doing on Sunday?
Would 1000 yen be sufficient?
I'm writing
I'm not a wanted fugitive
I'm not a wise man
What station is this?
Haven't we done enough?
I'm burnt out
I'm your maid
I'll wait for you at the gate
You are fooling yourself!
We've arrived!
Tom is here now, so let's eat
But what should I bring?
Would it be a scam?
Do you yield?
I don't know what he did
How much for this car?
How much is this car?
What a nice dress!
Is it drinking water?
You're right, more or less
I'm at my wit's end
Ziri rubbed the baby's back

Ziri was at his wit's end
When did Tom start smoking?
It's a routine for Tom
It's cold outside
Ziri came to Rima's apartment
Is it sunny outside?
Come back in an hour's time
Don't use that bridge
The water didn't return
Ziri let Rima's family go
Ziri examined Rima's condition
My car's broken down
I've seen one similar
Ziri's energy was so high
I've seen one like that
I've seen a similar one
Ziri began to call Rima's name
I didn't dig up the potatoes
Ziri bit Rima's hand
No, that's not my new friend
Guess who the guest was.
Ziri?
We're hardly ever together
I wonder if that'll work
You're right!
I hadn't thought of that
You're right!
I didn't think of that
You're right
I hadn't thought of that
What a nuisance!
I'm not a cop anymore
I'm a wanted man
I'm irritated
I'm not a beginner
We can't force you to stay
What day is it today?
Just say something!
What do you want to hear?
Your voice!
How can Ziri win the fight?
Ziri ended Rima's life
Don't give Tom ideas
Who's left the door open?
Who has left the door open?
I don't feel like pizza
I don't fancy pizza
Are you at home all afternoon?
Are you married?
I was.
Are you married?
I used to be.
It's the same as ever
It's the same as always
There's always a way
It's a stone's throw away
It's very close by
It's likely
That's likely
It's very likely
Ziri's ewe has got colostrum
Ziri's ewe is very stubborn

I'm not a religious person
Whose scarf is this?
I can't go
I'm busy
I'm not fast
You?
Wrap it, please
What time is it?
It's a quarter to six.
That's a good deal bigger
Is this pumice?
Did Tom make Mary leave?
Did Tom let Mary leave?
Did Tom ask Mary to leave?
I'd be surprised
Do you need a book?
Tommy didn't talk
You're such a cynic
Ziri tied the ewe's ties
Zir's ewe used to kick a lot
Last year, I was a fresher
The ewe's leg was tied
I wonder whether it'll work
You're fluent in Japanese
Why not suggest a translation?
Let's have a shufti
Let's have a shufty
Let's have a lookie here
Maybe Tom's in hospital
I can't do that any more
I can't do this any more
I don't drink any more
I don't go anywhere any more
That's not milk
That's water
I don't visit Tom any more
How old is the ewe?
The ewe's udder was bleeding
The ewe's teat was injured
The ewe's teat was bleeding
I'm not in the mood any more
I'm not your friend any more
Is Tom busy at the moment?
It's not funny any more
It isn't funny any more
The ewe's teat was swollen
It's likely to be true
Let's not argue any more
These aren't made any more
Tom doesn't live here any more
Tom doesn't sing any more
Tom's not singing any more
I must've read it wrong
United'll win.
Nah.
I'd put a fiver on it.
Bet you a tenner they won't.
Ziri's house erupted in flames
I met Tom at the doctor's
How long must I stay away?
Okay, this is crazy
What does Tom miss?
Huge thanks, everyone!
What does Tom lack?
Is Tom still active?
Don't waste your time on Tom
I'm not a hippie!
Movies aren't real
We're taking them
But what film did you see?
But what movie did you see?
You want a car, right?
Those mice are so cute!
Is it a good sentence?
It's simply fantastic!
Thomas doesn't drink much
You are really strong!
Don't be an idiot!
Here's the hot water!
Can you hear in the back row?
They don't get dressed
Is this dress sleeveless?
Poor parents!
I'm not a believer
Let's have lunch now
I didn't think of it
I've lost count again!
I've lost count again

Ziri's ewe got used to milking
Does milking hurt the ewe?
Ziri's ewe was eating the corn
Ziri's ewe likes to eat corn
We don't go anywhere any more
It's going to rain
I'm a failure
Was that hard to do?
Ziri's ewe is a lot calmer
Can I pet the ewe?
Sure!
Ziri touched the ewe's udders
Where is your house?
Well look there.
When does a lamb wean itself?
How do you wean lambs?
Me too, but not always
Ziri's ewe had triplets
It is magical!
How old is this ewe?
Ultimately, no
Ziri's ewe hid in the pig barn
So yeah, how should I do it?
Ziri's ewe stayed in there
Ziri's ewe ran out
How many ewes does Ziri have?
What a devilish boy!
Where is the source here?
It's actually what I wanted
No he didn't
He's firing on all cylinders
I came for you, Tom
Are you happy, Tom?
Yes, I'm happy.
No, I'm not a fox
Why do you ask?
I'm your boy
I'm afraid of dying alone
What time would be good?
I'm not a psychologist
I'm not a diplomat

What time should I come?
I should've changed that lock
I should've changed the locks
I'm not a good father
I'm not a detective anymore
I'm not a waiter

I'm glad we're friends
I'm proud of my kids
I'm proud of my mom
I'm proud of my mother
I'm proud of my progress
I'm proud of our guys
I'm proud of my parents
What does your child do alone?
Who got it?
Tom, of course, won't be there
C's get degrees
We will never give up!
I'll eat lunch with my friends
Listen to what he says to you!
No, it is done
No, I can not
The dog picked up Ziri's scent
I'm so done with you
May there be peace!
How do you make this?
Answer, please, yes or no
Don't fight, people!
I was not it, I swear!
In the desert, sand is cheap
Why did you follow me?
Let's start at once
We'll cook some meat
There's nothing more to do
It's ready to eat
What's the matter?" she called
Come on!
There's water in the valley
Do you like our furniture?
How did this project start?
What is there in the fridge?
Sorry, I can't
It is dark in Tom's office
What is the final amount?
I don't know what he likes
There wasn't much to see
This water is store-bought
How do you pronounce "pretty"?
It's pointless
I don't know what she likes
Is your bro gay now?
He is now a sailor.
It's worthless for Tom
Why did Tom call you again?
I'm not a priest
Did you say you saw a monster?
I'm not a prisoner
I'm honored
Where does this bus go?
Will it take long?
Hurry, or we'll be late
I'm not a pastry chef
It's been unseasonably warm
I know you're going to miss me
I've told Tom
I've told Tom already
What's your band's name?
I'm appalled
Tom doesn't love you
He loves me.
It's too early to give up
I'm a big girl
We're facing some challenges
What difference will it make?
If it is good wool!
Make room!
Don't run a red light
I don't tend to go out much
He's got to be kidding
You call that a knife?
This is a knife.
That's not a knife
That's a spoon.
All right, you win.
What rank do you hold?
What's your rank?
Somehow, Ziri made do
Ziri's eyes widened with glee
Ziri washed Rima's car for her
Ziri's secret was out
Ziri's family is back
Is this picture for sale?
Are these flowers for sale?
Ziri rubbed the puppy's belly
Can you ever forgive me?
I love you.
Oh, I love you most!
Ziri's limo was outside
I'll do as you suggest
Ziri couldn't stand it
Ziri's troubles continued
Ziri can't go to Rima's school
It was actually Ziri's idea
Ziri can't abandon his son now
Actually, I've been sacked.
Actually, I was sacked.
Now we're a real family
Ziri hasn't been OK for years
Is Tom cross with us?
Has Tom got the hump with us?
Is Tom angry with us?
Ask Tom whether it's true
It's in the past now
Why did you wash my laundry?
Don't talk with you mouth full
Ziri's career took off
Ziri's reaction surprised Rima
Have you heard what she told?
Ziri's birthday came soon
Ziri's heart started to play
Let's hurry
We're already late
Do you want one of them, too?
Let's ask Tom to sing
Let's ask Tom to cook
Let's ask Tom to dance
Let's ask Tom for help
Ziri hasn't seen Rima in ages
Ziri's brothers were jerks
Are you free tonight, Ziri?
Ziri's clothes were awesome
Where is the key?
Did you close all the windows?
Let's follow Ziri's example
I'll stay until the evening
Has the rain season begun?
Your answer isn't correct
Did you hear the customer?
Of course I did.
Let's go jogging on the beach
It's not warm
It isn't warm
Ziri helped Rima's grandpa
Do you have any shovels?
One for clearing snow.
Rima's behavior is impeccable
He's left his bag at home
I didn't get anything
I didn't receive anything
We're not put off by the rain
The rain doesn't bother us
I couldn't make up my mind
Everyone took Ziri's side
Ziri broke Rima's locker
I am just well-to-do
Darn it!
How long will he stay here?
If we are not tired?
Curse you!
Be cursed!
Was that not a stolen vehicle?
From which planet are you?
She mocked her!
Have I really written that?
In Spain, the siesta is holy
Listen, completely!
You are very slow!
Ziri's phone suddenly rang
How could a woman hurt you?
Did it do any good?
Don't you?
Pretty much," answered the man
You can't keep going like that
It'll kill you
Where did you and Dad meet?
What's keeping you here?
What are our main challenges?
What if he doesn't come?
Do we have long to wait?
Will we have to wait long?
Is this thing on?
What?
The camera.
This isn't our only problem
I'm not a southerner
That's the basic idea
There's only one way to check
I didn't even know them
You're too stupid!
Who's going to the beach?
Tom won't deal with that
Thanks for the warm welcome!
Can you recognise Tom's voice?
I'll make something to eat
You'll have to get used to it
You mustn't talk back to Tom
There's just two months left
Tom's pub burned out
Let me know if I'm wrong
Tom isn't a true friend
Did the police come for Tom?
The first plan given (fig
What does it weigh?
I'm not a customer
What's your school's name?
Was it broken?
Could you take a message?
I don't know why Tom resigned
You should've called first
Who's going with us?
Who does he play with?
Are humans fish?
What is a fish?
What should I do with them?
He's in a conference
Just leave them over there.
I'll be back by dawn
Will you lend me a stapler?
Do it for me, please
I've only done this once
I'm going back tomorrow
You can't make me go
You've ruined the party
I'm having a difficult week
We're always ahead of schedule
Let's forget about bad things!
I didn't do this by myself
I'm wondering which way to go
We'll never catch up
I'm too tired to continue
It's useless to fight
It would've taken me longer
I didn't reach my goal
It's been a tough year
I don't want Tom to know that
Let's hope it's sunny tomorrow
I'm going to get a bite to eat
We'll miss the train
Can you lend me your lighter?
A cheese sandwich, please
Do you have any envelopes?
They don't understand anything
Above all, let's not panic
I'll be miserable
We can't live without love
Are you over eighteen?
We'll be there in an hour
It's a difficult decision
Do you like applesauce?

That's why we were there
You can't send me there
Tom won't be able to be there
I couldn't even be there
Of course, I'll be there
I was hoping you'd be there
Do you have any theories?
What happens then?
I haven't seen Tom since then
Where should we put them?
Is this what scares them?
How do we stop them?
Why did you lie to them?
Did you deal with them?
What was wrong with them?
Did you agree with them?
Did you catch them?
Did you know any of them?
Do you recognize them?
Do you like them?
Do you need them?
I don't want them
Let's go and meet them
Now we're ready for them
Don't count on them
I'm very angry with them
I've never heard of them
I'd love to see them
You'll find them
Would you buy that?
Did you already know that?
Did you really not know that?
How did I not know that?
Did Tom ever ask you that?
What's funny about that?
Did Tom ask you about that?
What's so good about that?
Do you really want that?
Why do you want that?
Should I repeat that?
How could you miss that?
Do I have to answer that?
Would you swear to that?
Did we actually do that?
Did you ever do that?
Are you ready to do that?
Did Tom ask you to do that?
Do we really want to do that?
How is Tom able to do that?
Why do you need to do that?
Do you think I could do that?
Now why would I do that?
Can't we do more than that?
Why did you call him that?
What would you call that?
Why would I do all that?
Did you really mean all that?
Why did you steal that?
What makes you ask that?
Why would I think that?
Don't you remember doing that?
Would you stop doing that?
Why are we doing that?
Why are you reading that?
Did you know any of that?
Are you certain of that?
What did you think of that?
Are you capable of that?
Who'll believe that?
How would you rate that?
Have you ever done that?
Why do you call me that?
How can you ask me that?
Why did you ask me that?
Why are you asking me that?
Do you really like that?
Why couldn't I see that?
When did you decide that?
How do you think Tom did that?
Why would you read that?
Tom must've given Mary that
I thought you'd enjoy that
Well, I never knew that
Let's not talk about that
I've been worrying about that
I'm not asking about that
Tom wasn't kidding about that
I hadn't heard about that
Wow, you're good at that
We don't have time for that
Don't blame me for that
I can't remember that
I'll always remember that
Oh yeah, I remember that
Tom won't let Mary do that
Tom shouldn't do that
I knew you couldn't do that
I knew Tom couldn't do that
Tom says he'll never do that
Don't ever do that
Tom didn't want to do that
It'll be difficult to do that
I didn't remember to do that
I've been trying to do that
We're unwilling to do that
I don't have time to do that
I wouldn't like to do that
They're paid to do that
I'm not sure I can do that
I don't think Tom will do that
If I were you, I'd do that
I've never forgotten that
I'd forgotten that
I've never seen that
We'll do more than that
We're not going to risk that
I'll help you with that
I'm not saying that
I don't plan on doing that
I won't be doing that
Don't be afraid of that
I can't promise that
I'll see Tom before that
We're not all like that
I won't do anything like that
I'd love something like that
Tom was sure you'd like that
I hadn't heard that
I still can't understand that
I've never liked that
I'll send you a text
It's not so terrible
Do you want to play tennis?
Let's play tennis
I've got a lot to tell
Tom's parents are teachers
You can't be my teacher
I'm a school teacher
That's our French teacher
You're not a good teacher
What a beautiful tattoo!
Your daughter's tall
Where was this photo taken?
Which would you take?
Please don't move these tables
It's part of the system
It's a beautiful sword
Who taught you to swim?
Is Tom going to swim?
Is it true that Tom will swim?
Tom said he'd rather not swim
Tom doesn't want to swim
I don't think Tom can swim
I'm drenched in sweat
I don't swear
Don't be so suspicious
Do you think I'll survive?
I don't trust these surveys
Was anyone surprised?
That's why I'm not surprised
Well, I'm not surprised
I'm not a bit surprised
I'm not really that surprised
Tom must've been surprised
I won't spoil the surprise
It wasn't a surprise
Can I go surfing?
We don't know that for sure
I'll be there for sure
Who's your supervisor?
Do you ever work on Sundays?

Have you packed your suitcase?
Is this suitable?
Do you like my new suit?
I hope you didn't suffer
Do I look like a sucker?
I think you'll succeed
I'll come by subway
Can I change the subject?
Do you think this is stupid?
Do you think it's stupid?
Why are you so stupid?

That's a risky strategy
I'd never trust strangers
I think it's very strange
It's not so strange
I don't see anything strange
We're stranded
Who'd believe your story?
We can't publish this story

They're starving
I hope you don't starve
We don't have to starve
Shall we get started?
When does school start?
I didn't know how to start
I didn't know where to start
Finally, someone spoke
We're running out of space
I don't like this soup
What's causing that sound?
What's that awful sound?
I'm dreadfully sorry
Listen, I'm really sorry
Tom said he wasn't sorry
Look, I said I was sorry
You'll be sorry
You should've told me sooner
How did you get back so soon?
I hope you'll return soon
You'll die soon

Where do you sleep?
Last night, I didn't sleep
Let's try to sleep

Why did you ask me?
Why thank me?
Why would Tom attack me?
Do you want to do it with me?
Would you like to go with me?
Are you playing with me?
Are you messing with me?
How many of you agree with me?
Why can't you be with me?
What could you teach me?
Why are you insulting me?
Why are you fighting me?
Have you been calling me?
Why aren't you asking me?
Why are you thanking me?
Are you watching me?
Have you been watching me?
Do you ever think of me?
What's expected of me?
How did you recognize me?
Why can't you forgive me?
Could you ever forgive me?
Why did you leave me?
Would you all excuse me?
Do you think you scare me?
What made you blame me?
Don't you see me?
Have you missed me?
What was it you asked me?
Everyone, follow me
Don't hold it against me
Here's the letter Tom sent me
You'll eventually forget me
Please don't forget me
Don't try and protect me
You aren't me
You're too good for me
That didn't bother me
Maybe Tom doesn't remember me
My sister didn't help me
Tom didn't help me
I can't get anybody to help me
Look, you've got to help me
Tom didn't want to help me
It's too late to help me

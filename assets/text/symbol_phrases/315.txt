Thanks, I laughed
God bless Russia!
Fight me!
Bomb has been planted!
Let's put it off until October
Alexa, play 'Despacito'
You can't put these things off
You won't pull it off
Don't try to talk me out of it
Who has the key?
Tom does.
Who knows how to do this?
Tom does.
It's time to put it behind me
Please don't try to come in
Don't trust Tom
I don't owe anything to anyone
I just don't know anymore
How can I say this?
How do you say this?
Then who do you take me for?
Then what do you take me for?
Then who do you think I am?
Because you’re not seeing it
Do you use magic?
Nothing, don't worry about it
That's why he left school
Tom is really battle-hardened
Can I slap you?
I can't contain myself
Tom didn't try to deny that
It's time to try something new
My hard drive has 160 gigs
I'm enviably lucky
Do I cry easily?
Nothing's forcing you to stay
I'll say it
If I want to, I can do it
Why did you block me?
Do you want your ears to show?
This is mine, not Tom's
That's Tom's, not Mary's
I'm kind of in a rush here
I'll try to distract Tom
I always knew I couldn't do it
Is bread really fattening?
Hath not a Jew eyes?
Why, revenge
Let's try to reason with Tom
The answer isn't clear
It's a good way to learn
You’re just using me for sex
I don't think it's working out
Let's use a condom
Easy tiger!
Don't worry, I'll do it myself
Let's move in together!
Will you marry my sister?
Do you like me too?
Can I use the kitchen?
This place is great!
The motorbike won't start
What's your purpose?
Yes.
I guess that'll never change
Here, take it!
Easy, tiger!
He didn't worship the idols
I don't...
Obviously, because I'm not.
Well...
I want Tom to say he's wrong
Do you have an Esperanto flag?
Water doesn't have a color
Why do you wear glasses?
Y'are a dog.
You’ll die in agony
Oh yeah, fuck me!
Show me your ass!
Show me your tits!
Show me your pussy!
Suck my cock!
I’m horny
Fuck you, fucking cocksucker!
It's a crisp November morning
It's a mild November morning
Is it?
What the fuck did I just read?
Fuck Tom!
Shut the fuck up, Tom!
Yes!
Yes.
He doesn't care what he eats
It seems I've caught a cold
What shall tomorrow bring us?
Don't try doing that again
Where did you put the sweeper?
That's the food my food eats
Where are you at?
Down on Preposition Street.
Mary has Graves' disease
We can't find Cookie
I'll try to convince Tom
I'm sorry if I wasn't clear
I'll talk if I want
I don't know that tune
Are you Tom's parents?
It's better with butter
We should've seen this coming
I told Tom I didn't need it
How many cookies did you bake?
How much stew did you make?
Why?
Is there a power cut?
Who said romance is dead?
I can't decide what to do now
They'll arrive at 3 o'clock
Where's your bag?
I left it in the car.
Was it yesterday?
Has she arrived yet?
Has she already arrived?
He'll arrive tonight
He'll be here tonight
She'll arrive tonight
She'll be here tonight
What day was it?
I'll be there in two seconds
In that case, I'll come
In that case, I'm coming
Have you arrived in town?
Quick, stop, drop, and roll!
We don't know what to expect
Tom didn't stop crying
Don't throw it out
The coffee isn't helping
He thinks he's Tom
I don't know Hungarian
Will she be here soon?
We'll come back and try again
They've got to learn
He's my lover
It's my lover
It's her or me
Madam, I'm Adam
Tom came to me, crying
Don't be afraid, Tom
How was Tom involved?
I'm out
How was the match?
Tom's dog tried to bite Mary
We don't want to stop yet
Let's meet a Chuck's Diner
Shiver me timbers!
You've grown a lot as a person
For lunch, I ate leftovers
It's free.
Libre or gratis?
That stuff doesn't exist
Let's meet at Mom and Dad's
Tom, will you answer the door?
You've made a wise choice
I'll try to change Tom's mind
Nothing, it seems, can stop it
Tom can talk anyone's ear off
I don't dare to speak to him
I don't dare to speak to her
I'm going to make you cry
You're my cousin
You didn't even ask how I was
I'm made of honey.
Aww, you're sweet.
I guess I've just been lucky
Do you know that I like you?
I'll buy a new notebook
Everyone's thinking about you
You haven't eaten yet
Why did you go to the airport?
I'm still learning how to read
Do you feel young?
What day is the game?
In my room there are 2 beds
Who do you want to help us?
We don't want to rush this
To get better, you have to eat
You don't like Nick, right?
Let's go downtown today
I'm going downtown today
Y'all are friends?
Never take a bribe!
It's very unlikely to work
His eyes are pitch-black
Don't lose sight of him.
Don't give in to blackmail
What's that noise?
It's a deer barking.
No?
You don't know it?
You like Nick, don't you?
No way.
Come on, be honest.
It's been a real treat for me
Did you take a nap?
You took a nap, didn't you?
I took a 30-minute nap
Do you often take naps?
You're a bad child
The students aren't learning
The students aren't studying
How dare you call me a liar!
Can you put them on?
What else do you know?
Somebody's sensitive
His old cat's still living
Who built this bridge?
I won't ever try that
I've lived here since 1993
Please, follow me
Where can I find help?
Where can I make a complaint?
The idea wasn't only mine
The idea wasn't mine alone
What do you think?
Is it blue or green?
I realized my father's dream
I'm rich as fuck
It's too sweet for my taste
Where is that quote from?
I buried him.
I buried her.
I buried him.
I buried her.
I buried him.
I buried her.
Who are you talking with?
The Lord Himself.
There's lemon in it
You said you'd quit
Eat if you're hungry
Prove you're not a coward
This coffee isn't fit to drink
Good morning, darling
Good morning, everyone!
That doesn't mean Tom agrees
I'm a social justice mage!
That's not a giant mosquito
In hindsight, it's pretty dumb
Why did Tom break the window?
He needed to get in.
Brian, what's your ethnicity?
I'm Scotch-Irish.
Oh!
Splendid!
He laughs when he's tickled
Dad, I'm scared
That's the only way it'll stop
Don't poke a sleeping bear
Here's to your health
Would you like some toast?
A cause of death wasn't given
I'll try to get there by 2:30
I'm dying to try that
This wasn't what I had in mind
Are you gullible?
Find out for only one dollar!
Do spiders eat flies?
It wasn't wrong
That wasn't wrong
I wasn't wrong about that
Tom isn't a Vietnam veteran
It's Tom's job to stop them
Cool!
An owl!
I'm worried about Tom
What's he doing?
It's good to disagree
Don't worry, Tom
I'll help you to find a job
I'm sure glad he's gone now
Why are you so cute?
Eat my dust!
Do you like my language?
You're the cutest girl in here
You're the cutest boy in here
I think that's unfair.
Sit down, everyone!
We shall discuss this!
Do you like me, too?
I promise I'll never hurt you
Don't worry
I'll do it myself
I'll find you and I'll hug you
Tom's quick to notice things
You're my favorite cousin
You're my favorite niece
You're my favorite nephew
I'll talk if I want to
I always assume I'm wrong
Don't ask me why it happened
Are trees edible?
But microscopes are fake news.
Violence isn't the answer
Don't take it
You know I can't agree to that
I don't see what the joke is
Can I pour you some compote?
Do we have a paper clip?
It's feast or famine
He's calculating
She's performing calculations
He's performing calculations
She's calculating
“Yes, I am concerned
Just then, Tom walked in
Fire in the hole!
Team!
Fall back!
Stick together, team!
I'm defusing the bomb
I'm planting the bomb
I’m getting hard
I’m so horny
OK, just stand where you are
The answer, of course, is yes
It's too late to stop Tom now
What a bitch!
You'll pay
Is it warm outside?
Why?
He doesn't seem to like it
Why is it so warm here?
It's time to do some sport
It's time to do some exercise
It's time for some exercise
Can you read and write French?
I don’t give out anything
I don’t give anything out
Don't mind if I do
Milk and two sugars, please.
Tom is my daughter's boyfriend
I have to see that!
Can you lend me your pencil?
Which one should I buy?
There's no reason to rush
Did you see squirrels?
Yes, I did.
Is the kitchen fully staffed?
Do you think I'm dangerous?
Let's take the stairs
We're keeping an eye on Tom
Why does popcorn pop?
Did you remember to buy bread?
Did you remember to buy milk?
Tatoeba's logo is really ugly
Tatoeba's logo is hideous
Did you try doing that?
You should learn French, too
Tom's a bit slow on the uptake
You answered to yourself, Tom
Will Tom come?
I would think so.
Are you up to it?
They're fish
Bring the ventilator quickly!
I can't stop doing this yet
Maybe he's telling the truth
We don't want to rush anything
Tom's dog tried to bite me
I've read all his books
I've read all of his books
I've read all of her books
I've read all her books
I'm in the building now
I'm not sure he truly loves me
You're welcome
Is anyone home?
No, go away.
Shut up and listen, will you?
Why did Tom buy a map?
Let's let Tom handle it
Who ate up all our food?
It's a real problem
I'll get there around 2:30
There won't be a merger
When does the library open?
Are those three horses yours?
Do you like vegetarian pizza?
What's in this glass?
The dog's name is Cookie
That must've cost a fortune
What brand do you recommend?
I don't have a favorite brand
For supper, I made spaghetti
Don't be scared
Whose idea is this?
Tom walked past Mary's house
There's a park of sorts there
Tom tried on his father's suit
Why did Tom stop by?
That's not what matters
They don't love us
They don't love her
Which one?
I said the alcoholic.
OK, but which one?
Je ne sais quoi?
What?
Wait, I'll walk you out!
You can't make this stuff up
Doesn't it hurt your back?
I’m here with you
You’re the sunshine of my life
What's wrong?
Did something happen?
Have you tried this cake?
You'll be my only love
When will you be at home?
Good boy!
That's a stop I need to make
It's not against the rules
Why don't you like fishing?
Today's been a pretty busy day
Don't lose courage, kid
It's just human nature.
Citation needed.
It’s the final countdown!
No one cares, Tom
But we've already decided
He'd rather avoid people
Only a moment remains!
She's at a crossroads
He's at a crossroads
Wasn't it you who wrote this?
Be quiet!" he urged
It's an indefinite pronoun
It's a transitive verb
Maybe you'll learn something
Has Cookie gone out?
Is Cookie a dog or a cat?
She's a skunk.
Today, I want to cook pilaf
Don't be unfair
I'll expose you
Don't be so arrogant
Don't act so surprised
We didn't expect that
Of course, I remember it
That'll be all for today
I'm going to fail this class
You'll certainly regret it
The bottle's almost empty
We're going to Tom's place
Don't hang up the phone
Do you want to learn French?
I'm still learning how to read
Where's the eraser?
Where's Ziri?
We don't know a Ziri.
That's a transitive verb
Ziri cut off Rima's path
Tom didn't hit Mary back
Do you have olive oil?
Can't you hear?
The phone's ringing
I think you're spoiling him
He was fifty-four when he died
This job doesn't pay well
I'm your daughter
It's OK to be expensive
It's an issue of feeling
Tom's car was never found
Do you have a juicer?
Don't let on that you know
I'll try to help them
Now's not your turn
Don't eat like that
Everything's on Wikipedia
I'm starting to understand Tom
Are bargain prices important?
We don't have any leads yet
Well, I'm a patient person
Mom, why's that man crying?
It's a famous poem
Do you prefer tea?
I'll go make tea
I don't really like tea
Want a sip?
Need a hand?
Got a light?
That's what they say
It's a famous song
Promise me you'll stay away
Why did Tom try to do that?
It's just a drunken language
Is it warm out?
He's done us a disservice
Don't forget to sign it
Please don't forget to sign it
A minute's silence was held
There was a minute's silence
Why don't you do any sport?
Are you staying or going?
How can tick bites be avoided?
How can you avoid tick bites?
He's writing her a letter
He's writing a letter to her
He's writing him a letter
He's writing a letter to him
Why did he leave his post?
Why has he left his post?
Why did he leave his job?
Why did he give up his job?
Why has he left his job?
We're planning to stay a week
I've brought some biscuits
And that's no exaggeration!
We've written the report
Where have the years gone?
I don't need to see any more
Wow, that's a lot of flowers!
I love flowers.
Tom apparently doesn't care
Was she mad at you?
I don't really remember.
You think?
Alright, I will.
How can Tom stop us?
He's an enemy spy!
Let's go shopping together
Would you like to come along?
You're really famous here
Is she your type?
There's no point in arguing
In fact, why are you here now?
I brushed my dog's shaggy coat
It's OK to be tall
It's an issue of feeling
I'm not yet sure what we'll do
They won't even listen to you
I can't do anything about that
Tom's students adored him
The answer, for now, is yes
Of course, the answer is yes
Now, the satellite is in orbit
Euthanasia isn't the answer
Why are you taking this class?
Tom isn't good for Mary
What a mess!
What coins are you hodling?
Tom is an anarcho-capitalist
Yes, I totally agree with you
Don't fix what ain't broke
English isn't a language
It's witchcraft
Sit still and eat!
Who needs this old wreck?
I'm used to being in trouble
That's the kind of life I live
And if we make a trip?
So, the matter is settled
So, that's settled, then
There's no scientific proof
Now take the tickets, please
Today's game is crucial
Today's game is a six-pointer
She'll write a letter
She's going to write a letter
She's partly right
She doesn't seem to agree
They're probably tired
Forgive, but don't forget
Don't get in the car
He's writing an application
We're partly responsible
Don't get older, get wiser
Where have we got to?
Where've we got to?
Whoever smelt it, dealt it
I can't stop doing this
Is it wise?
We're in for a treat
Oh no!
Ziri didn't comment on it
She has English guilt.
What's that?
Do you often travel?
Are you used to travelling?
I wish I had not left at 1p.m
It sounds like it's raining
Why haven’t you called me?
Where have you been?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where have you been?
It's the only way I'll learn
Did you wake 'n bake?
Let there be eternal peace!
I guess I can't stop you
Between the two, my life flows
Don't expect me to do that
I'm sure of that.
Odds are you're one of them
I'll be your pet if you want
Tom couldn't say no to Mary
Who pulls the strings here?
Well, I guess that makes sense
I'll call you later, I promise
Did the past really happen?
They'll adore me
Tom said he'd try to help Mary
We weren't soldiers
Pass Tom the salt, please
She's dumb
It’s vogue to bash PHP
You're not dumb
You're dumb
I'm dumb
Stop nit-picking
He's always nit-picking
We didn't know what to expect
Mary's wardrobe is luxurious
You brought her cognac?
Did you bring him the cognac?
Let's sit on the terrace
He's trying to cling to it
He's trying to grab it
We've been working non-stop
“It's a hot market
They didn't listen to me
I can't say
Now's the time to leave
Do they run every day?
Does she run every day?
All aboard, please!
It's possible to appeal
Definitely!
What about tonight?
There's still a bit missing
My brother's got one
It makes me cringe.
Tom's just an also-ran
I hope you've had a good rest
Hello, I like money
Stop copying me.
Stop copying me.
I don't want to see you again
Tom's demeanor changed
Once you start, you can't stop
Will this fit in your purse?
I'll try not to do this again
Now just listen to me, OK?
It's him I believe
I'm going to catch some Z's
Tom didn't try the helmet on
Please don't distract me
Aren't these pretty?
OK, I'll just stand over there
It's very pretty here
I can take care of myself, Tom
It's a great spot for swimming
You are so lucky to live here!
Tom visited St Mark's Basilica
Who ever cares ?
Who should ever care ?
Tom’s mouth is really blue
Tom wasn't able to stop Mary
Your feelings are superfluous!
I will raze your home!
Is peat a type of podzol?
What a cute wind vane!
Tom didn't try on the helmet
Tom needs us, and we need him
Are you done with work?
OK, you can stop laughing now
Tom wasn't talking about Mary
It doesn't matter if I get wet
You're breathing
You're obviously wrong
I didn't want to tell you yet
Why did Tom stop talking?
It's working so far
Ziri doesn't kill babies
I'm glad we can agree on that
What has Ziri written?
Ziri's company handles events
He doesn't need me
It's time for us to stop now
I'm kind of freaked out
You say tomato, I say tomato
Will you recognise her?
We'll continue tomorrow
We'll carry on tomorrow
Isn't the table dirty?
He's a great bloke
He's a smashing lad
He's a smashing fella
He's a diamond geezer
He's a lovely chap
He's a top man
Have you written your name?
They're not very transparent
I'm getting a book today
I haven't got much bread
I don't have much bread
Give me bread, I am hungry
Work is fun.
Come back!" he cried
I'm waiting for my mum
I'm not staying here long
Is this a current photograph?
Now, it is orange
You'll need to help me
Tom said that he'd prefer stay
We need to be ready by 2:30
There's a skunk on the porch
It's time to stop this madness
Do we have any paper clips?
Who ate all our food?
When will you be getting home?
We're partly to blame
I've brought some cookies
I've brought a bottle of wine
When did you start working?
You're the cutest girl I know
Someone might've helped Tom
It's a good day to do nothing
Please don't forget to sign in
Did you remember to buy rice?
Why do people like doing this?
Why do people like singing?
Call me when you've finished
I'll never forget it
I reckon he's in Boston by now
This isn't Tom's pen
I'm full of energy today
Right now, the answer is no
Tom tried to catch Mary's eye
It's a really good cause
Is this a current photo?
When I say no, I mean no
We're looking for a cook
She's used to staying up late
Hello?
Ziri?
Yes, speaking.
Somehow, we have to stop them
Do we still have this fabric?
Don't forget to let Cookie out
Why are we arguing about this?
“Then stay home.”
“Why not?”
It's an adrenaline rush
I guess it's my fault
You can stop by at about 2:30
Somehow, they make do
How big a pumpkin do you want?
Sic 'em!
Sic!
Cookie, sit!
Paw!
Down!
Roll over!
Good girl!
“Ah, love the robot
I don't like vinegar
I'll wash up
Where's the dishcloth?
Pilates really works my core!
How is the soup?
It's delicious!
I'm drinking wine
It's always on my mind
I'm in the dog house
This is Tom's formula
Everything's better with bacon
You believe me, right?
Of course, Ziri.
Some people don't follow rules
Where the hell is Matt?
That's the way Tom is
Doing that wouldn't save money
Tom isn't likely to trust Mary
I forgot about you, Tom
I'm sorry
I'm not free tonight
Tom wasn't wearing a kilt
Tom won't do this again
I've got no reception
I don't have reception
I've got no signal
It's not good for you
You're not allowed to eat
I'm here for just a day
Tom's gate was locked
It's overcast
Is there no escape?
Is there no way out?
You finally made it!
You finally did it!
There's no need to take notes
Yes, I knew
You've changed a lot
I'm still the same as before
The world is what's changed.
I haven't really changed
Tom won't believe Mary
Tom won't leave Mary alone
Tom's house was dirty
This is Tom's T-shirt
That T-shirt is Tom's, too
I've been to see my friend off
I think that they'll be late
I hope you'll answer soon
I should've bought that shirt
You're scared
Can I ask you for a kiss?
Look!
A flying saucer!
I don't have a charger
I've been to the library
Don't be all grumpy
Tom isn't obligated to do this
I need a phone, and fast
I don't know my dad
Is vodka antibacterial?
I've lost faith in the doctor
He's really arrogant
I'm not going anywhere today
He's never ridden on a train
I can't give details
Is soup eaten or drunk?
Ziri's life depends on it
Do you hear the waves?
What are you doing over here?
Tom won't get very far
Tom's feelings matter
You don't mess around with Tom
I don't like Thursdays
Can I hit that?
Good morning.
Morning.
How'd you sleep?
Coffee.
If you want me to stay, I will
I'm feeling creative
I'll eat this later
You're so vain
Mom, I want some chestnut rice
Can you make some?
It's like I'm on Ferenginar
There's only one explanation
Tom's room was messy
I'll go myself if need be
Let's play football
I'm going to get some shut-eye
Mary is your daughter, right?
I've been lucky until now
I'm tired of being alone
I've lost interest in it
I've looked for it everywhere
It doesn't come easy
Tom won't miss that
Tom won't look at Mary
Rima may go the wrong way.
Ziri won't say a word
What a big spider!
Tom won't be able to do it
Tom isn't that into sports
So what really...
I'll ask the questions here!
What are we really paying for?
Tom won't get mad
Most people don't save enough
Where did all the money go to?
Happy Friday!
I'm going to make some tea
Would you like a cup?
Not that it's not possible
Not that it's unacceptable
You won't see me there
Tom wouldn't lend me his car
Tom didn't seem out of control
That child's name is Tom
Tom's story was funny
Tom's dog has fleas
Tom won't listen to Mary
Tom won't call me back
Don't spill the wine
The answer isn't clear-cut
And this time it's for good
You're not allowed to eat that
You aren't allowed to eat that
We're about to cut the cake
You're so lucky to live here
I don't care if I get wet
We're getting out of the lift
I'll leave it all up to you
What shall I make for dinner?
What shall I make for tea?
Tom won't text me
Tom's burnt the porridge again
Cathy's not in.
She asked me to pop round.
It's not getting any easier
It won't get any easier
Ring me when you've finished
Phone me when you've finished
That's all I could find out
Do you know them?
I hope Tom won't get angry
It wasn't an act of God
Tom will be late, as usual
It's beyond our control
Tom won't say no to that
Let's not rule that out
I'm waiting for you outside
I'm not an envious person
I'm not envious
It won't take long
Don't be evasive
What have you done?
Come on, confess!
Don't be evasive
Was it you who was there?
I don’t spoil them
Don't teach me how to do it
Do we have paper clips?
It's a Saxon village
Carlsen 1, Nepo 1
It's out of our control now
Who are you trying to call?
I can see the baby's head
I can see the baby's head
I can see the baby's head
Is it a boy or a girl?
It's a girl
You have a baby girl.
How many sheep does Ziri have?
What do sheep eat?
Ziri's sheep need a lot of hay
Ziri's sheep are picky
Ziri's sheep is a year old
Ziri's sheep are loud
Ziri doesn't breed sheep
Can you climb a palm tree?
Ziri won't leave Rima
Ziri is Rima's grandson
Ziri is Rima's brother
Ziri didn't have a sister
Ziri can't fool Rima
Ziri returned Rima's call
Ziri is one of Rima's clients
Ziri can't hear Rima anymore
Was that Ziri on the phone?
Where did they put the baby?
Where did they take the baby?
What did they do to the baby?
Ziri abducted Rima's baby
Ziri's sister is here
Ziri isn't doing anything
Ziri can't be in here
Ziri can't be here
Rima is Ziri's mistress
Rima is Ziri's wife
Ziri's son is so beautiful
Ziri's son is so handsome
What's that cross for?
Are you Catholic?
What's the rainbow flag for?
Are you..
Ziri can't take Rima with him
Ziri won't be able to see Rima
Ziri wasn't expecting it
Ziri looks like he's rich
Ziri won't let that happen
Who's this woman?
Ziri got Rima pregnant, too?
I love you, my daughter
Ziri's daughter called him
Ziri said he couldn't stay
It's all free
I know what you're like
You've got what it takes
I won't be staying here long
For now, let's sit here
I'm tired of living alone
Tom said that he'd fix the TV
He's going to sit down
I'm depressed today
I'm feeling down today
Tom won't be home today
I have to finish this by 2:30
Everything's white outside
Right now, it's out of control
Ziri ruined Rima's drawing
Don't forget your lunchbox
I'm leaving it all up to you
Tom can't do that to Mary
Look..
You've broken my arm

I don't need any favors
Did you discharge a weapon?
I've been banished
What are the prospects?
It'll need to be configured
Not a chance!
That's just brutal
Did you find his record?
He's wanted
It'll be a challenge for him
He's more idealistic than most
What's your story, bud?
What can I get you, bud?
What is your return policy?
I'm feeling nothing
Correct your course!
Why did it come to this?
Why must this transpire?
This is pitiful!
Can you quench your desire?
It's the simple things
They're melting!
Where I can I find solace?
Don't say goodbye
Was there ever a chance?
Why do you torment me?
It's too steep a climb
Cast out the devil, fool!
I'd like to formally apologize
I'm sorry for your grief
If only for awhile..
Now you've stirred things up!
Are you bitter?
Can you forgive them?
Pick up the phone!
Can you call my father?
She's very sick
I'm coming back soon
We're stuck at the theater
What is your legacy?
I've gone lo-fi
The rust won't stop
Don't drown in the rain
I haven't the time
I won't be there in time

How many slices of bacon?
We're improving over time
Can it get better than this?
Those noisy leaf blowers!
Can you meet me downtown?
Can you buzz me in?
Are you into minimalism?
No, let's not get pizza
I'd like to forget
Focus!
Will this cost extra?
What is this fee?
Can you remove this charge?
Was it my fault?
Will my insurance cover this?
I've stumbled
Let's hear this new riff
You've had a year
It's all superimposed
I'm supercharged!
Will there be a surcharge?
Which time zone are you in?
Why do you get my hopes up?
I'm sick of all these devices
Patience, my man
Why isn't this more difficult?
Good, I'm not alone
Yeah, baby
What is your ultimate goal?
Does he know you know?
Is all right with you?
You're covered in sores
What a weird song..
Alright, OK
Ready for seconds?
I'm not sure you understand
Lord, open their eyes
Isn't it a pity?
Can you give back?
Soften your tone, please
It'll be a stretch for me
What is your status?
Did you drink all the milk?
I'll need to factor that in
Sami did it in self-defense
Sami's father was a monster
Sami is Layla's stepdad
Sami's mattress is outside
Sami held Layla's mouth open

Do you want some, too?
Try to see!
Have you read all his poems?
Select the correct answer!
Sorry, I misunderstood you
Tom sold the book for 10 euros
Are you busy at the moment?
Go quickly for help!
Tom's back suddenly seized up
Call a doctor quickly!
I am a woman, not a girl
I'd like to learn how to ski
I wasn't hungry anyway
You can always run!
Tom's forehead touched mine
I've never skied before
Do you know how to ski?
Do I hear a bit of jealousy?
I'll go greet him tomorrow
Send the photos by post!
How are we going?
Now it's your turn to play
There, you are mistaken!
It's my turn!
What happened to your project?
In his face!
In your face!
Finally, you're back
You will not change Tom's mind
Tom's thoughts wandered
Do you still need of me?
Or can I go to sleep?
Would you have a daisy for me?
Go ahead, tell me
Quick, hide this piccolo!
Stop that flautist!
You're welcome to stay here
Mary got Tom's goat
Patience, Mary, patience..
What a blimp!
It's just a blip on a screen
My robot won't stop beeping

Then why didn't you?
I can't wait for Christmas day
Watch the movie and be quiet!
Whose chair is this?
Mine.
Now I'll tell you the truth
I have one last question!
Could you make me an offer?
Could we meet?
Will you allow me?
Tom's father never remarried
I would like to see you again!

That's bad news..
What are you smoking?
Tom's legs were crushed
It can't be solved
I'm not popular in the office
Is this a good time to speak?

I didn't order pizza
Don't hog all the room
Let's schedule a time
I'm waving at you
Do you see me?
Tom, the pizza's here
Why don't you do the honors?
I want chocolate everything!
Do you want parmesan cheese?
Do you want pepper?

Like this?
That was a little too much.
Who will correct my mistakes?
Does she know that?
Is he implicated?
What will be the new standard?
Why is he indifferent?
It's just so vast
Your dogs are invited, too
OK, I'm going out
I'll be back

This is my daughter, Mary
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
And the problem is?
I'm so hungry
I love dill pickles!
What?
Get out!
When did you get this idea?
Why do you want to earn more?
Happy Birthday!
By the way, how old were you?
Tom can always wait!
Why do secrets fascinate us?
Christmas is coming!
But you're really bad
Does it recycle?
Let's stop here and buy a map
Do you sell maps?
Do you have the map?
Where is the map?

Does anyone else know?
It's none of their business!
Why does this happen to me?
What else can I help you with?
Would you like to contribute?
Any volunteers?
Don't smoke in here!
Put it out!
I'm washing clothes today
Where's my life vest?
Any takers?
Will there be a test?

Not feelin' too great
Too greasy!
You can't drink seawater!
It's like he's a new person
He's turned his life around
I don't recognize him anymore
I'm not that sophisticated
I can't figure myself out
Where can we place the blame?
Are you using this chair?
What is the appeal?

Is she on the mend?
Is the operation dangerous?
Will she make a full recovery?
What time will you return?
Will you be open tomorrow?

Sairu...is she a mother yet?
Sami's inlaws stayed overnight
Sami can't afford raspberries
Sami talked to Layla's father
Sami's son had a play date
Sami made a call to 911
Sami is a 911 dispatcher
Sami's children were crying
Sami's skull was crushed
Sami didn't take action
Sami's life was in jeopardy
Sami broke his son's arm
Sami was Layla's hero
Will she come back someday?
How is this word written?
Please leave at once!
Shit!
I don't get any of your jokes
Should we save them?
Nah.
That's a nice song

Why?" said Tom
Can you search online?
Walk the dog, please
They've been hypnotized!
Why exactly did you do that?
I can't fall asleep or breathe
Go suck a dick!
I can't stand rats
You cannot defeat me!
I'm going to LA
I'm not on track with my diet!
Find God, if you can
We're enemies
Could you walk the dog?
Do you feel God's ubiquity?
Please stay!
Will you cheer for me?
Look at us!
Hold steady!
Do not call me that!
I'll see you in Hell
Why should this make me angry?
Each is one, but together two

She's sleeping softly
Do you like my beard?
She's breathing
He's into armed robbery
Maria isn't Tom's enemy
I'm still waiting for you
I know it for sure!
Who is already awake?
That's life, unfortunately!
Who is my opponent?
What do you call love?
It's cold out and you're warm
It's freezing!
I'm a big fish in a small pond
Who's sorry now?
May I have a pickle?
There's a BMI checkpoint ahead
Please, stop
Different?
How so?
Any news?
Any new adventures?
Who is your dermatologist?
One will open!
How is your stomach?
Loosing hair on your head?
Nice Kool-Aid mustache, dude
He's not believable
It's a modern design
I'll ponder it
He's such a poser
He's a total tool
No one can spell "spaghetti.
Is there a Jewish deli nearby?
He doesn't like baguettes
It's always quinoa with him
Can you give me an update?
What is your agenda today?
Which folder should I open?
You will not deter me!
Thank you, you have fixed it
Fuck this beard!

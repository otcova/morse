I'm encouraged
Tom wasn't discouraged
I don't want to get upstaged
That's when everything changed
Tom's appearance has changed
One thing hasn't changed
Tom's arms ached
It's not so far-fetched
I've been adequately punished
I assume you're qualified
Well, I lied
Tom isn't in the least worried
Believe me, I've tried
My bag's always packed
We're all deeply shocked
It's time you two talked
That isn't what I asked
I've done as you've asked
Tom's wounds have healed
Tom's birth records are sealed
Tom's face paled
Tom's clothes are disheveled
Tom's hair is disheveled
Tom's eyes twinkled
Tom's eyes sparkled
I've never been so thrilled
It's been dismantled
You've got me all rattled
That's what had me puzzled
You're all doomed
Tom wasn't a bit alarmed
Tell them we're unarmed
I don't need my carpet cleaned
Let's see what happened
Tom's eyes softened
I'm so frightened
I've just been reassigned
I should've declined
You've been forewarned
I'm stumped
No one would've cared
It's as I feared
I can't believe you remembered
Tom's attention wandered
Tom's daughter was murdered
Tom isn't so well-mannered
It's been delivered
Tom didn't deserve to be fired
I think I'm about to get fired
I'm so bored
Tom wasn't displeased
That's what I promised
Tom's ego has been bruised
Tom isn't licensed
I'm so depressed
Tom's imagination was aroused
You're about to be exonerated
I hope you're well compensated
You aren't what I expected
Please tell me I'm adopted
You're so kind-hearted
Now look what you've started
I'm so wasted
I get why you're so interested
Tom wasn't a bit interested
I'm going to have you arrested
Tom's patience was exhausted
I don't think we were spotted
I don't wish to be rescued
Tom could've survived
It's a miracle you survived
I've never felt so loved
That can't be allowed
It's been destroyed
I hope you're well paid
I always thought I'd be afraid
I'm so afraid
Tell me you're not afraid
That's what the papers said
I'm not ashamed of what we did
You're a weird kid
Tom is just a mixed-up kid
I'm not being paranoid
That's unbelievably stupid
I guess we're getting old
I really don't feel the cold
I'm so cold
Brr, it's cold
Tom removed Mary's blindfold
I'm putting you on hold
We're at peace with the world
Hey, welcome to the real world
That's where I stand
I'm here tonight as a friend
You're the perfect girlfriend
You're the perfect boyfriend
It's a special blend
I'll let you know what I find
I think you've lost your mind
I haven't lost my mind
You've got a dirty mind
Tom wasn't fooled for a second
I'm not buying it for a second
I knew you'd come around
What goes around, comes around
Well, I'll see you around
Tom's gun is on the ground
I didn't want to play God
I don't like alcohol, period
We'll grow more food
It's a waste of food
It'd be good
That'd be good
That won't do us much good
It'd look good
Let's make this look good
Tom isn't looking too good
That wouldn't look so good
Tom's appetite was good
Tom's reputation is good
I do think this isn't good
I don't feel that good
They aren't that good
It doesn't look very good
I've been pretty good
Somebody's in a good mood
I'm really not in the mood
I couldn't make myself heard
That shouldn't be hard
Let's not go overboard
Tom is under 24-hour guard
Let's give Tom his reward
It's kind of awkward
It's a bit awkward
That's a little weird
Tell me this isn't weird
I won't breathe a word
I didn't listen to a word
Don't you say a word
I'll spread the word
We'll spread the word
I'll take Tom at his word
I'm so proud
That's as it should be
You should've seen your face
You've got food on your face
Cookie licked Tom's face
Tom looked up into Mary's face
We'll leave this place
Tom isn't even in the race
I'm not the police
That'd be nice
I think you're just being nice
I don't see it as a choice
It's the logical choice
Now it's your choice
It's your only choice
I didn't raise my voice
I don't need to hear it twice
It's worth the chance
I won't get the chance
It's your last chance
It's your best chance
It's of no importance
I've discovered new evidence
That hasn't been my experience
I swore I'd make a difference
There's a lot of difference
I've been with Tom ever since
Tom didn't reply at once
I'll make myself scarce
We're investigating a homicide
I've got nowhere left to hide
You're in for a bumpy ride
You're on the wrong side
I'll be right by your side
I knew you'd take Tom's side
The law's on my side
Tom's eyes opened wide
You've got the wrong code
Now you've got all three
That's what I like to see
We can't be too safe
That'll cost you your life
I've had the time of my life
You're part of my life
I'd trust you with my life
I won't beg for my life
It's a green card marriage
We're on the same page
You don't even have a webpage
They've increased Tom's dosage
You've always had an advantage
That's about to change
That'll never change
It's all very strange
I'll take that challenge
Tom's killer is still at large
When Tom died, I wanted to die
I couldn't leave Tom to die
We're not about to let you die
You're one sharp cookie
I can't tell a lie
That's a stinking lie
That's no lie
No one's asking you to lie
I don't need a tie
I don't have a favorite tie
Tom won't get a fair shake
They're hard to make
There's too much at stake
It's an honest mistake
That's the part I like
I can do that if you'd like
I know exactly what it's like
That's the part I don't like
It's Tom's idea of a joke
This is somebody's sick joke
Tom's reputation is impeccable
I think that's understandable
It's unique and irreplaceable
There isn't one available
I know someone who's available
It's admirable
Tom's loyalty is admirable
They say it's incurable
I don't need a table
That's very hospitable
Tom's voice was hardly audible
You're not so horrible
Tell me how that's possible
It'd be impossible
That'd be impossible
Tom says we're not compatible
I'll make yours a double
I'll save you the trouble
I'm in desperate trouble
Call if there's trouble
Don't go to all this trouble
It's been nothing but trouble
Call me if there's any trouble
There's no sign of a struggle
Tom's life has been a struggle
I know it's been a while
Tom didn't crack a smile
Let's make this simple
It's never that simple
It's all very simple
Let's settle down, people
You have your orders, people
We're reasonable people
I don't like upsetting people
I didn't make you a cripple
I don't need a whistle
I'm clean as a whistle
I won't blow the whistle
I'll take the bottle
I've chosen you to succeed me
You've already thanked me
You could've fooled me
I know why you've contacted me
This isn't about you and me
Don't say that name around me
I'm really glad you can see me
You're just a thief like me
That's why you should hire me
You don't have to lecture me
That's why you love me
That's another one you owe me
You don't need to patronize me
You don't have to patronize me
I guess you've heard of me
One thing's bothering me
They can't touch me
Tom, don't play dumb with me
That's totally cool with me
Don't toy with me
Don't try to sweet talk me
Tom is a fool, if you ask me
I really wish you'd call me
That's what people call me
That's what my doctors tell me
You didn't hear that from me
Don't expect any mercy from me
It'll be on me
Don't you dare bail on me
Don't you give up on me
The cab ride's on me
You've been holding out on me
Don't you pass out on me
That's not how it looked to me
You're so attracted to me
It's good that you came to me
You didn't have to come to me
It's all coming back to me
You'll talk to me
That's of no concern to me
This isn't fair to me
You're precious to me
Hey, you can't say that to me
I'm not letting it get to me
You're a valuable asset to me
I don't know what got into me
This isn't a good time for me
Don't ruin it for me
That's what worries me
That's what troubles me
That's what concerns me
That's what bothers me
You don't have to impress me
I guess you've caught me
I don't need you to support me
I knew you couldn't hurt me
I won't let you hurt me
You've lost me
You couldn't live without me
That's not why I came
I'm here for the card game
You can't watch the game
I'm really tired of this game
That's not my real name
We'll never be the same
It doesn't look the same
It's just not the same
They're investigating a crime
I'm here to report a crime
We'll make the time
Now isn't the time
It's quitting time
You're losing precious time
It's the right time
There's always a first time
It's not my first time
There's more to come
I've got to get Tom home
It's too close to home
I've got a child at home
You're getting very tiresome
That'd be fine
They're going to be fine
I think we're fine
Hang in there, Tom
You're doing fine
That's hard to imagine
That'll keep Tom in line
It's going to be mine
The pleasure's mine
I've got mine
I'm under quarantine
You're an odd one
You're the married one
You're the strange one
I'm the insane one
We're going back to square one
It's back to square one
It's a tough one
You're the cool one
You can't handle another one
Tom's a clever one
Let's try it with this one
Tom isn't budging on this one
Tom's path is a difficult one
I'll run out and get you one
I'm the crazy one
Tom is asking if we're done
Tom, look what you've done
We can't get Tom on the phone
It's better to be alone
I'm so alone
I'm not trying to trick anyone
Tom didn't dare tell anyone
Just sit tight, everyone
Tom is well-liked by everyone
You don't look like a dope
It's our one hope
You're our best hope
I'm your only hope
We're ready to go if you are
I'm ready to go if you are
Tom's feet were bare
You're going to require care
Tom is under a doctor's care
I'm not living on welfare
You won, fair and square
I'm sure Tom is quite sincere
We've got one rule around here
I never thought I'd be here
That's why we came here
You're way out of line here
You're playing with fire
I'll let you off here
I'm busting out of here
I'm getting a bad feeling here
That's what I'm doing here
I'm waiting here
You're out of your depth here
You can't be back here
I can't hear myself think here
We're not in control here
I'm the victim here
I'm very busy in here
You can't be down here
I'm burning up here
I'm up here
It's lovely up here
You're not a prisoner here
The door's over here
Tom, look who's here
We're the victims here
I've got proof right here
You don't get to sit here
That's how I got here
Let's be honest here
It's not just here
That's why I called you here
I'm of no use to you here
That's why I brought you here
I'm dead if I stay here
Tell me you're there
It's just sitting there
I know you're back there
Tom won't even know I'm there
Thanks, Tom
I'll take it from there
Don't make me come in there
It's all in there
I know you're still in there
I don't like Tom in there
I have to see who's in there
Hey, you can't sleep there
I didn't make it up there
Tom's fiancée was there
That's why I was there
We can't send Tom out there
It's a scorcher out there
I didn't even see you there
You wouldn't last a day there
I've got to be somewhere
It's in here somewhere
Tom's mind was elsewhere
Tom's mind is elsewhere
I'm never going to go anywhere
I can't do it just anywhere
I've been looking everywhere
That wasn't here before
I've seen that look before
I can't help myself anymore
I can't stand lying anymore
Tom won't lie for you anymore
I don't need the brochure
It doesn't exist in nature
Don't leave me again, please
Let's go for Chinese
It's a reasonable compromise
Tom's face showed his surprise
Tom couldn't go anywhere else
I'll tell you something else
It'd make sense
It's just common sense
That's just common sense
That'd make sense
I've got many of those
There's not a moment to lose
That's not very close
It's coming loose
You're as pale as a corpse
You're backing the wrong horse
I've made it worse
Hey, I could do a lot worse
There's no third course
You're free to go, of course
I really can't refuse
We're giving you the house
Don't just show up at my house
That's open to debate
I don't need a date
I didn't ask you on a date
It's just not appropriate
Wow, it's really late
I don't need a plate
You've got a lot on your plate
Tom isn't illiterate
It's never black and white
It's not black and white
I'm sick of white
I'm not changing my vote
You're incredibly cute
There's one born every minute
There's no substitute
You're way out of my league
That's a little vague
It just can't be true
But that isn't true
That simply isn't true
That's not totally true
That wasn't exactly true
You're ducking the issue
It's not just a safety issue
I don't need a tissue
I don't know what I have
That's not a choice you have
I'm not Tom's slave
I don't know what I believe
Tom doesn't have a lot to give
You shouldn't still be alive
That's why I'm still alive
I've never felt so alive
Tom's resume's impressive
Tom's very effusive
I've always fought to survive
It's good to be in love
I'm definitely falling in love
It's the price we pay for love
It's a good move
That's a good move
You've got a lot of nerve
Tom didn't even bat an eye
You've got to apologize
You're the one who's tone deaf
Tom's face showed his relief
I'll make this brief
I'll make this very brief
I think we'd better be off
Tom couldn't help showing off
I didn't rip you off
That's your half
Tom could've kicked himself
Tom couldn't contain himself
Tom can't seem to help himself
You're not so bad yourself
You're no prize yourself
You can't help yourself
I've only been fooling myself
I don't have to explain myself
It's a great gag
You're a disgusting pig
You're a lying pig
They think we're a gang
It doesn't look too convincing
I'm usually better at reading
Tom isn't good at pretending
I've done some bartending
I've done some soul-searching
We'll not tell you a thing
That's probably a good thing
That isn't the same thing
You're right about one thing
There's no such thing
I didn't do any such thing
You've done a marvelous thing
I know it's the right thing
It's got to mean something
I'm on to something
Tell me you've got something
I'm sure it was nothing
I'm afraid to touch anything
Tom hasn't picked up anything
You can't say anything
Nobody's going to try anything
You can't see everything
I'm going to make everything
I've been trying everything
I'm telling you everything
You're my everything
You and I shouldn't be talking
That's your pride talking
Hey, now we're talking
There's been enough talking
You've got to get Tom talking
Listen to who's talking
The other kids aren't talking
I've been doing some thinking
Listen, I've been thinking
That's all I'm asking
You know what I'm asking
I don't need any counseling
Tom's left arm is in a sling
I know it's coming
You should've seen this coming
I really didn't see it coming
You should've seen it coming
That's what I find alarming
We understand what's happening
It's still functioning
That's just what I'm doing
That's what I was doing
I can't see where we're going
It's as far as we're going
That's where I'm going
That's why I'm going
This isn't exactly helping
I know what you're offering
Tom's confidence is wavering
I didn't know you were hiring
It's a little embarrassing
Now, that's just embarrassing
There's a girl missing
It's amusing
That's what I'm investigating
I know who you're protecting
I'm definitely not waiting
You're evil and disgusting
That's what I'm betting
Well, that's upsetting
Don't tell me you're quitting
You'll get nowhere by shouting
I'm not worth saving
That's really a good carving
That's all I'm saying
That's what I'm saying
It's very gratifying
You know I don't like lying
I'm not saying Tom is lying
Tom just can't stop crying
Hey, I'm still trying
That'd be amazing
It'll take too long
You've been gone for so long
OK, people, move along
I think we'll tag along
I've been with Tom all along
I wouldn't play along
That's where you belong
You don't have to be so strong
Tom is short, but he's strong
It's dead wrong
I've found nothing wrong
You've got me all wrong
That's just plain wrong
Of course, you weren't wrong
The day's still young
I'm pulling the plug
That'll do in a pinch
I'm still free for lunch
You're on your own for lunch
There's always a catch
You've met your match
I'll take the first watch
I'll take first watch
There's another hitch
Let's take it down a notch
It doesn't look like much
It doesn't bother me much
I don't like to plan too much
You've done so much
I didn't learn very much
It's important to laugh
I think you've helped enough
I've suffered enough
I'm just not good enough
That's long enough
I'm well enough
I don't hear that often enough
That's not soon enough
That's a little rough
Tom's promotion came through
I think you'll pull through
We're only halfway through
I came by to feed Tom's fish
I know I'm being selfish
You're going to need a push
I've seen my share of death
They're out of breath
I won't hold my breath
Let's do the math
I'll take this path
I don't date women I work with
I don't have much to work with
You're grounded for a month
I couldn't tell you the truth
That'll stop the leak
Tom still didn't speak
I just can't catch a break
You've always been weak
That's why I came back
It's all coming back
You'll get them back
I promise I'll give it back
It's great having you back
We've suffered a minor setback
I'll double check
It's a gimmick
It could've been a trick
You've had me worried sick
You're making us all sick
I'll make this quick
I'm off the clock
You missed your ten o'clock
I think we're in luck
You're pushing your luck
I couldn't believe my luck
I've eaten enough for a week
We'll have a nice long talk
It's your fault I can't talk
I don't see why we can't talk
They couldn't talk
I just thought I'd take a walk
I didn't rob any bank
Tom's face suddenly went blank
That was pretty cool, I think
I don't know what I think
Tom wasn't sure what to think
I don't pay you to think
You're better than you think
I'm back in the pink
No one's buying anyone a drink
It's a piece of junk
I'm so drunk
You're off the hook
Let's take another look
Tom couldn't help but look
Ha, I made you look
I've never seen such good work
It'll be hard work
Twenty to one it'll work
I'll need someplace to work
It'd better work
I'm here looking for work
I'm a fan of your work
I've been following your work
It can't work
I'll start the paperwork
I'm afraid to even ask
I know it's a lot to ask
It's kind of you to ask
That's no easy task
I agree we're taking a risk
Tom isn't a flight risk
It's completely illogical
Let's do the deal
This one's the real deal
I couldn't tell what was real
I didn't know that was legal
It'd be illegal
Tom's injuries are superficial
You're making this personal
You don't have to get personal
Tom isn't exactly a liberal
That's how I feel
It's time you knew how I feel
I don't know how I feel
That's the way I feel
I'm not going to fight a duel
I've already posted your bail
You'll die in jail
I'll visit you in jail
I'll take this trail
Tom wasn't late after all
That's not good at all
This isn't a social call
This is your wake-up call
That's Tom's call
Hey, get away from the wall
You're mad at me, I can tell
It's really hard to tell
This isn't going well
Tom isn't looking very well
That's a buzz kill
You'll need to hold still
I just want to do God's will
We're ready to roll
Don't play me for a fool
It's disgraceful
I'm so grateful
God, you're beautiful
It's astonishingly beautiful
You've been most helpful
You're even dumber than I am
It's just the way I am
You're part of our team
I don't need a cardiogram
I'm not what I seem
I have very low self-esteem
That's why I like them
Don't take any notice of them
We're not at war with them
We're cuter than them
I've learned to trust them
You're better off without them
I don't find it a problem
You're a victim of the system
You've got rhythm
It's not authentic, Tom
This one's got me worried, Tom
Tell me you understand, Tom
I can be your friend, Tom
Leave it be, Tom
Get out of my face, Tom
It wasn't your choice, Tom
You never had a chance, Tom
This is your one chance, Tom
We're on the same side, Tom
You saved my marriage, Tom
Don't ride the brake, Tom
We're not bad people, Tom
You can't control me, Tom
Come out and talk to me, Tom
This isn't your home, Tom
You're a strange one, Tom
I owe you one, Tom
Help me out here, Tom
You've lost me there, Tom
This way please, Tom
Get off your high horse, Tom
I've come to say goodbye, Tom
That's good thinking, Tom
Stop sniveling, Tom
You should be smiling, Tom
I'm ready and willing, Tom
That's very amusing, Tom
You'll need your strength, Tom
Dial it back, Tom
Get with the program, Tom
Don't rub it in, Tom
We'll be together again, Tom
This is one you can't win, Tom
Get your clothes on, Tom
Don't run yourself down, Tom
Dial it down, Tom
Tell me you remember, Tom
Listen to your father, Tom
Don't sass your father, Tom
Don't be a party pooper, Tom
I admire your scruples, Tom
Stay on your toes, Tom
I just tell it like it is, Tom
You have your orders, Tom
Fake it till you make it, Tom
You're all heart, Tom
We meet at last, Tom
Knock yourself out, Tom
God be with you, Tom
Don't let it get to you, Tom
God has a plan for you, Tom
I have good news for you, Tom
Get over here right now, Tom
We don't have all day, Tom
I don't care what you say, Tom
Have it your own way, Tom
It doesn't work that way, Tom
You've done admirably, Tom
You handled that badly, Tom
I knew I should've married Tom
You're the guy who killed Tom
Somebody might've followed Tom
It's important we find Tom
I don't need to convince Tom
It's urgent that I see Tom
That's why I like Tom
I didn't much like Tom
This isn't like Tom
I'll make everyone call me Tom
You've certainly outdone Tom
That's how I know you love Tom
Don't grow too fond of Tom
I've grown rather fond of Tom
I've heard of Tom
I've lost track of Tom
There's still no sign of Tom
That's the last we saw of Tom
I've been seeing Tom
I'll see what's keeping Tom
There's no stopping Tom
I'm not the one hurting Tom
I can't seem to reach Tom
Maybe I'm in love with Tom
I'm through with Tom
It's time to level with Tom
I'm moving in with Tom
I'll take it up with Tom
Clearly, you're angry with Tom
You'll spook Tom
You'd have to ask Tom
Let me in or I'll tell Tom
It wouldn't hurt to tell Tom
I'll let you tell Tom
They're trying to restrain Tom
They must've relied on Tom
Don't waste your breath on Tom
I didn't sneak up on Tom
That'll depend entirely on Tom
This must've belonged to Tom
You've got to apologize to Tom
Today we'll be talking to Tom
It wouldn't be fair to Tom
It's very important to Tom
I'm recommending you to Tom
I don't know what got into Tom
I didn't try to stop Tom
Don't make a fuss over Tom
I didn't come here for Tom
Nothing's good enough for Tom
That's good enough for Tom
It's just big enough for Tom
I won't cook for Tom
It's been a hard night for Tom
It hasn't been easy for Tom
You've got to respect Tom
They're here to protect Tom
We're about to meet Tom
I didn't plan to hit Tom
It's our duty to support Tom
I wouldn't bet against Tom
We're done talking about Tom
I'm not upset about Tom
I have faith in you, Tom
I'll run it by Tom
There isn't much room
You've done enough harm
It'll work like a charm
You're my good luck charm
I'm going to hit the gym
Let's salvage what we can
I don't know what I mean
You're the historian
It's a plan
That's part of the plan
I'm an old woman
You're quite a craftsman
We're at war with Japan
We're not at war with Japan
I'm taking the minivan
You're such a drama queen
We'll be dining in the kitchen
You're sadly mistaken
Don't go out into the open
Come in, it's open
Let's get it open
This is what'll happen
This is what's going to happen
Well, it's not going to happen
I didn't say this was heaven
That's got to be a good sign
I guess that's a good sign
That's usually a good sign
I'm impressed by your design
I won't let Tom come in
That's where you come in
That's how Tom got in
You're being negative again
You're showing off again
I won't blow you off again
We'll be together again
I'm going to read this again
Let's try this again
I suppose we won't meet again
You'll see it again
I'm delighted to see you again
Somebody's yanking my chain
Look, I can explain
You're getting to be a pain
I'm racking my brain
You've got to be certain
I've been eating protein
We're stretched a little thin
You're guilty as sin
I don't have anything going on
See what's going on
The party's back on
It's a special occasion
I'd like to hear your decision
I'm waiting for your decision
I know you're on vacation
Tom isn't on any medication
There's been a complication
It's an ongoing investigation
I've got inside information
Now, all I need is information
I'll use my imagination
We're on top of the situation
It's for your protection
You're under my protection
That's an amusing notion
Staying here isn't an option
That's hardly an option
That's not a question
That's a mighty fine question
Your sanity isn't in question
I'm done with this question
It's barely noon
It'll wear off soon
Tom didn't come too soon
You'll be one of us soon
Tom couldn't find his son
Tell me there's a reason
It'd be treason
It's now planting season
You're going back to prison
I won't go back to prison
Tom isn't a stable person
I'm a people person
You're a strong person
You're an evil person
Tom isn't a truthful person
It's Tom calling from Boston
You're finished in Boston
We're trying to get to Boston
We're halfway to Boston
That's of no concern
Your safety isn't our concern

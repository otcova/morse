Tom's stepson is an addict
I'm not a person
I'm a robot
I can't read this
The font's too small
Does it rain often here?
Has everybody arrived?
It doesn't look difficult
It doesn't look soft
It doesn't look easy
Hey Tom, look!
I got a perm yesterday!
What do you think?
I don't see any broken bones
I have a question, too
You've arrived too late
The table isn't clean
We're not like you
Why is Mary sulking?
Are you free tomorrow, too?
It's cold in the kitchen
I've lost my bus ticket
Can I really take that risk?
You don't have to stand
It wasn't a pleasant night
It wasn't a pleasant sight
It's translated into French
That'll be very interesting
You weren't listening to me
I don't intend to stay long
I'm not planning to stay long
Why's the dog barking?
The snowplow couldn't get by
We'll eat when we get there
Tom doesn't wait for anybody
It doesn't matter who does it
Did the children fall asleep?
I'll take care of the flowers
Has Tom already fallen asleep?
I'll meet Tom at the bus stop
I'll tell you about the case
Tom's pen fell off the table
Did you tell anyone I'm here?
What happened to the engine?
I'll see Tom after I get back
I'll teach you to play chess
May I visit the church?
It's synthetic leather jacket
Tom tickled the baby's feet
I'll speak to you tomorrow
In the end, they all lose out
They don't read when they eat
I'll tell you what I want
Or rather, what I don't want
We all followed Tom's example
Let's have a cigarette
What song is Tom listening to?
I'll speak with you tomorrow
Put it in the hall, please
Our youngest son's name is Tom
I'll read a book
Have you told anyone I'm here?
I'll remain at home
You like Tom a lot, don't you?
Who told you I'd come?
I'll try it again
It's far above all that
I'll write to you tomorrow
Can Tom play an instrument?
Why did you argue with Tom?
Tom, where did you find this?
Does Tom remind you of anyone?
I'll show you how to solve it
I hate you!
But in reality, she loved him
Mercury.
Gold.
Lead.
Silver.
Indonesia.
Hungary.
You didn't ask Tom anything
Why?
Izmir.
I'll say something about it
Sacramento.
Austin.
Don't worry
He's eating bread
She's eating bread
Is there water on Mars?
Probably not!
Why do you agree with Tom?
Did you get it?
That’s just Tom being Tom
Do you want to be friends?
Tom is who I'm looking for
Don't let her drink
I'll write to Tom tomorrow
Tom's house is dilapidated
It doesn't matter who does it
It’s summer in Paris
The pilot won't arrive late
Tom didn't go anywhere today
Did you tell anybody I'm here?
Can I visit a synagogue?
Can I visit a mosque?
Were you at Tom's yesterday?
I'll stop it
Tom doesn't like taking taxis
Stop playing devil's advocate
Tom, could you do me a favor?
Tom wasn't honest with Mary
We aren't like you
That isn't something we need
We don't have any kids
You can't live without money
We're being treated unfairly
What should I write to Tom?
You'll find out tomorrow
You won't last that long
Tom won't last for long
She's going to die
Tom's subscription expired
Don't mix everything
I won't forget anyone of you
That's my method
Where is Tom located?
You didn't do that
As usual, she arrived late
Can you stay for a moment?
Tell me!
Tell me!
Where were we born?
How old are you?
I'm 16 years old
She doesn't trust her future
How's the soup?
Not very good.
How's the soup?
Not so good.
How are your grades.
Not so bad.
I'm a little more relaxed now
I'm a little calmer now
You know, I won't live forever
You came on foot, didn't you?
Yesterday wasn't a normal day
You aren't a saint either
Tom is a good-natured man
So, what should I do now?
We should've foreseen this
We need to talk.
What do you need?
I'm pregnant.
You'll certainly get better
Shall I get married?
You can't be afraid to fail
Tom can't stand black coffee
Yanni's mom is no fool
Tom can't come out right now
People say I'm hypocritical
Tom isn't a radical
Let's get going to Algiers
Going to Algiers?
Yanni lives in Algiers, too
Good idea.
I've taken you off the list
This way, you'll forget me.
Have you visited Australia?
Don't want to go to Australia?
I'm sure of it!
Leave me alone!
I'm not your wife anymore
You shouldn't have said yes
Take me away from here!
You can't trust these people
This is my neighbor's son, Tom
Is there a mosque nearby?
Watch out!
It's probably just the weather
How could you leave Tom alone?
It sounds like Arabic.
This is Amharic.
Pardon me?
The language they're speaking
It's Amharic
It's a Semitic language
I don't need a translation
You haven't convinced me
Tom didn't have time to answer
Go to the lifeboats!
You're losing your edge, pal
You're out of practice
I'll wait for Tom here
You need to go to hospital!
Where did you learn Spanish?
You said you didn't drink
I wish I'd told Tom not to go
Tom's message was incoherent
Be patient with Tom, please
We won't keep you too long
Who do you ask about?
Can you see it too?
Have you heard about Tatoeba?
Someone touched Tom's shoulder
Why that?
Would you like a glass of tea?
Will Tom be OK after this?
I'll put Tom on the next bus
You shouldn't stop there
You shouldn't be in there
Should I get a tattoo?
I'm allowed to do this
You aren't at all like Tom
You can't translate it
You aren't as young as I am
Tom's arguing in bad faith
I'd never seen snow before
I'm hungry.
Hi, Hungry!
I'm Dad!
I don't have the answers
Are these Tom's glasses?
When did Tom do that, and why?
You came by bus, didn't you?
I live in my cat's house
I live in my cats' house
I've found it
Tom held out his hand, palm up
We aren't going anywhere
You're not as young as I am
You're not a saint, either
Did you switch off your phone?
You're going the wrong way
You've got to turn round
You're going the wrong way
You've got to turn round
Will it still be open, though?
Will it still be open?
Do you know when it closes?
Do you know when it shuts?
It shuts at 5.30
There it is!
It's still open.
No need to panic, was there?
It's still open
It's down here
It's down this road
It's at the end of this road
It's down this street
It's at the end of this street
What does his wife look like?
She's got more books than me
It's not my cat
Tom's losing his mind.
Tom's losing his mind
Tom's going crazy
Maybe he's already left Kyoto
It didn't quite take an hour
Have you parked far away?
Did you park far away?
Why did you park so far away?
It doesn't look like enough
That doesn't look like enough
It doesn't seem to be enough
That doesn't seem to be enough
Today is her sister's wedding
Tom's up
The light's on in his room
Have you got Josie's address?
I've got less than you've got
I've got less than you
I've got fewer than you've got
I've got fewer than you
Can we take a picture here?
May we take a picture here?
He's sitting in the armchair
We're going to the park
They're listening to music
She's listening to music
Corporations don't have rights
I'm switching the light off
I'm switching off the light
I'm sawing some wood
I'm doing homework
Mary's got a question
He's taking a photo
She's going by ferry
They're eating ice cream
He's eating an egg
He's buying butter
We're looking for her car
We're looking for his car
She's looking for her car
He's looking for his car
It's tea
That's tea
He's going crazy
Tom's lost touch with reality
It's talking to me
Tom didn't take off his jacket
Why do you think Tom did it?
Tom's an old sea dog
You can't live without sleep
Because of this, I left
You said you weren't scared
You said you weren't afraid
I'm not required to do that
Magnificent, Richard!
Mary was busy, too
Oh, you're right, Ludwig.
What a sweet life, Ludwig!
Is Tom still in the pool?
You can't argue with that
Maybe Tom is waiting for Mary?
You don't need wings to fly
You'll sound like a nerd
I'll try it again later
I'll try again later
Did someone warn you I'd come?
I don't mind
You've eaten almost nothing
I couldn't help but notice
You must've changed a lot
You aren't offended, are you?
Is what Tom said really true?
Or should we go further?
Tom didn't kiss me goodbye
Tom didn't kiss me good night
I haven't seen Tom this week
What gave him away?
You'll find the link below
You haven't won anything
It's our bus
I'd better not to say
It's not mine
You've done the impossible
It's been nearly 3 hours
Would you like to take a seat?
An encyclopedia-like mind
He's absolutely a crook
You're not as young as me
He'll become a good family man
Does Tom need to be here?
Now he's Muslim
It's a Christian celebration
Because we're Muslim
He's in Algeria
Algeria is Yanni's new home
Does it snow in Algeria?
Of course.
What's your religion?
Islam, of course.
Are you Muslim?
Sure.
Are you Muslim?
Of course.
Are you two Muslim?
Sure.
You aren't my wife anymore
Are you Muslim?
Ever since I was born.
Are you Muslim?
Yes, sir.
Are you Muslim?
Why are you asking?
Are you Muslim?
Is that a problem?
Are you Muslim?
Are you Muslim?
Are you Muslim?
What is it to you?
I don't like Tom's new hat
Tom's new cat doesn't like me
Why is Tom wearing that hat?
Why's Tom wearing that hat?
Why is Tom wearing a cape?
Why's Tom wearing a cape?
Where can I find an imam?
You really are good.
Thank you.
You don't understand
You don't understand
You're right
It's Berber
What is it?
It's Berber.
What's her name?
Skura.
It sounds German.
Yeah, but it's Algerian.
Let's take this raccoon home.
I wouldn't recommend it.
I'll leave when Tom gets back
Which path should we take?
Happy Solstice!
That's your house, isn't it?
That's your horse, isn't it?
Won't this ever end?
I don't like this book
Can you recommend another one?
We don't have any more ice
We're out of ice
Don't spoil it for me!
We've got company.
Call the cops.
Can I help?
I'm doing fine.
Do you find me talkative?
Why would I think that?
I'm sorry.
It's OK
No damage done.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
For what?
Sorry.
It's alright.
I'm really sorry
I don't know what to say.
What's this?
It's a gift for you.
Oh, that's so sweet!
Thank you!
What the f..
Why is your method better?
Fire me.
Anything you want, sweetheart.
Anything you want, darling.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Tom's not married
Tom's letter was heartbreaking
You know, Skura?
Yes?
You're really special.
Let's have a look at this leg
Does it hurt here?
Let's have a look at this arm
Does it hurt here?
Ouch!
I just don't want to
I'm not alone
Work is work, and play is play
What's that guy's problem?
You don't need to know this
Don't let the fire die out
I've gotten into trouble
Don't waste so much effort!
Don't waste you time
Tom hasn't contacted me yet
You're no better yourself
Do you have plans for Monday?
Have you ever heard Tom cry?
You definitely won't like it
You don't know my plan yet
Go for it, Tom
What's that rumbling sound?
You know I don't like it
That's a mango
You've flooded the engine
That isn't expensive
Could you help me a bit?
When did you buy these eggs?
They're really afraid
You'll get a scholarship
How deep is this hole?
Don't tell anyone my secret
Don't you need some money?
We've run out of painkillers
Is your room cold?
You aren't doing your job
I'm sick of politics
You're now taller than me
Are those Tom's boots?
I don't pay them
I'm Timorese
Your words touched my heart!
We don't have any more cheese
Did you turn the TV off?
You won't need it anymore
Will you visit us soon?
It's good Tom isn't here
So, what have you done?
Where do these ways lead to?
You'll never work here
You said you didn't smoke
Can you catch a fish?
Do you have money with you?
Is Tom retarded?
Can you understand this?
Why won't Tom let me do that?
You can opt-out if you like
Tom isn't really a team player
You could've asked me first
Tom's a hillbilly
You've done everything right
Tom's Bulgarian
You can't keep up with you
Stop panicking!
Where do you think I met Tom?
I don't pay her
You've always been lucky
I'm listening
You can't divide by zero
I'm Bulgarian
You aren't as young as me
You're completely mistaken
Tom's dragon had dragonlings
What does her wife look like?
Is that what he said?
You shouldn't assume that
She's eating some bread
You're going to get cold
You'll get cold
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
Has there got to be a reason?
Why are you smiling?
Need there be a reason?
Why are you smiling?
Have I got to have a reason?
Why are you smiling?
Do I have to have a reason?
You won't get off that easy
Why are you smiling?
Do I need a reason?
We saw it, as well
We've seen it, as well
He didn't know anyone there
We're home at last
Don't let that soup get cold
We've helped them
That's not what we said
Can they be believed?
We weren't married
They're monitoring proceedings
We're drinking
You invited me, so I came
They're not at all alike
They're not at all similar
Has Mary already gone?
Has Mary already left?
There'll be other times
Tom's sneeze startled everyone
They're looking for a book
She's looking for a book
She's eating sweets
He's eating sweets
You've been very convincing
Are you sure?
A hundred per cent.
There's money on the table
Do you have a television?
I've just been sick
I've just vomited
Others followed Tom's example
It starts about 2:30
It's only just left
You've ruined everything again
Join the Grammar Antifa!
It'll be gone soon
Soon it'll be gone
You'll never beat me again
Have you told Tom the news?
You've left me with no choice
Does Tom need to go to Boston?
The corner grocery's open
They have jujubes in season.
All right!
My name's not listed
That's a common reaction
Is there a phone nearby?
And who is the bride?
There's room for everybody
You don't weigh more than me
I'm reading the Quran
Fancy a bite to eat?
You're so contrary!
Fancy a cup of tea?
Do you have a bucket list?
Is catnip safe for kittens?
I'll talk to Tom in private
Will I have time?
I'll get a tea
Let me know when Tom's on
Sure, I'm free Monday
I can do Monday at 2:30
I'm free Monday
Will the lockdown ever end?
How's your weekend going?
I'll be leaving tomorrow night
Aren't those your glasses?
How was the rest of your week?
Get to it!
It isn't your turn
I guess you haven't met yet
I'll brew up some tea
Fingers crossed it'll be ok
Didn't you read the contract?
It's denatured alcohol I think
You got your bike?
It's slow going this week
You don't make the rules
Oh, I forgot to reply to you
You aren't that old either
Who does Tom live with?
Is it not appalling?
Does this look like malice?
Don't be that guy
It's enough for today
I've a bad head for names
Balderdash and piffle!
Oh Tom's into horse riding?
We both know you're lying
That's sheer brilliance!
You shouldn't have refused
Tom's a bit posh
Pep yourself up, woman!
They declared a truce, finally
You're acting unreasonably
Trying saying "No" some time
Say "Yes" to life
You can't win this battle
You shouldn't be doing this
Can you see what Tom is doing?
Let's call it quits
Just go home, seriously
I've always hated Australia
I've never liked living here
I'm not alone
I'm with Tom
Tom isn't alone
He's with Mary
That proves that I'm right
I don't think you'll do it
I've already heard this once
I'm a desperate person
Tom's birthday is next month
It isn't hot today either
I hope that it's not a problem
I hope it isn't a problem
I hope that it isn't a problem
I don't need much time
I'd rather stay in the house
I'd rather stay inside
I'd rather stay in my room
Why didn't you call anybody?
I'm being treated unfairly
What color is Tom's shirt?
There's a bird over there
That isn't what I ordered
You're so easy to deceive
I don't enjoy fishing with Tom
You and I weren't invited
Who's the new stiff?
I won't read it anyway
You're seriously mistaken
Are these seats reserved?
Tom can't handle the tension
You can't deny the truth
Why didn't Tom want to come?
You've done everything wrong
There isn't a single tree here
You're not that old either
Where's the TV remote?
It's always time for coffee
You must've been blown away
Tom didn't put his things away
Why would you build a bomb?
Could I talk to Tom, please?
What motives could Tom have?
You weren't even born then
You know I don't trust you
Cripes!
You're an excellent teacher
He's never been this late
Tom's dog fetched the ball
I'm sorry that Tom is leaving
You're not offended, are you?
Our oldest son's name is Tom
Tom's quitting smoking
You're missing something
I don't just watch TV
That's not the way I heard it
Tom isn't guilty of anything
You don't have to go back home
I won't do any of that
I'll make Tom do it again
You have to be ready by 2:30
You shouldn't have said no
Tom really doesn't like that
You're not my type at all
Why did I come here?
You've scored 30 points
Wash it with hot, soapy water
We're all out of tinfoil
You shouldn't have seen this
I can't remember a thing
I'll feel lonely without Tom
Did you say goodbye to Tom?
Do you have sugar?
What do elephants eat?
A pox on you!
Fancy a pint?
You've made a fool of yourself
Right now, I am busy, Tom
You don't have to come here
Would you like more soup?
Would anybody like more soup?
Are you through?
You can't swim to the island
It's too far away
That wasn't important to Tom
You know I don't like that
I'll have to help Tom do that
Is your lighter new?
Why do I feel so empty?
Have you sent the email yet?
Well, it's good that Tom left
Tom doesn't like olives
You'll outlive all of us
You aren't tall, like me
You're very naive
You shouldn't rush things
How did you get wounded?
You'll definitely get well
You weren't like this before
You aren't well-informed
Are you still mad with me?
Do you have any bath bombs?
School's been shut for months
I'd be more than glad to help
Tom isn't my husband yet
Are you positive about that?
He just doesn't know it yet
You can't get away from me
I'd rather stay inside today
Families don't have to match
You can't argue with the facts
How do I look?
I'm definitely gay.
Can Tom actually do that?
Can Tom actually do it?
You're not that important, Tom
Is everybody talking about me?
No, Tom
You're not that important.
Is everyone talking about me?
No, Tom
You're not that important.
Do those shoes fit?
Tom doesn't have a TV
Tom doesn't have a television
Tom won't believe me anyway
I'm going shopping
We both know that you're lying
You don't look like a thief
You may go, but be careful
Why did Tom put that there?
You'll soon make friends
You've helped me so much
You aren't very intelligent
You aren't very hospitable
I don't know if I'll go or not
You'll have to ride with us
Whoever gets there first, wins
The quilt can't be washed
He's in the emergency room
I'm a life guard
I'd like to get enough sleep
We can't win this battle
He'll do what he wants
It's so nice to have heating
Do you want me to invite him?
It doesn't fit there
You're so corny
That's a lie!
I'm not against anyone
Do you have the symptoms?
It's too late to say sorry
It burns!
I'd zip it if I were you
I'd shut up if I were you
You can't fool me so easily
Was Tom drunk?
Probably not.
It couldn't go very fast
Tell us if you're not coming
This key isn't from here
The A/C is killing me
The sooner you go, the better
Don't you want me to go?
He doesn't feel like it
You talk as if it's my fault
You've completely confused me
Does Tom have a lot of money?
Let's rent a bicycle
Can you turn up the echo?
I can't stand this pain
You didn't have to wait for me
Let's adapt
You're getting on my nerves
It's easy to prepare
He's going to the park
Where are my red stockings?
I will burn everything!
I'm too weak to fight
Welcome to Sylt!
We don't want you to get bored
Did the pills work?
You know I don't like this
When will Tom show up?
Do you have a bigger pan?
Do you have a Band-Aid?
You must've gotten it wrong
You're technically right
Tom isn't going to do it again
You'll have to wait a bit
I'll go to the doctor
I have to study hard, too
I have to study hard, too
Tom's plan has gone awry
It isn't new anymore
No one can resist Tom's charm
Tom's hometown is Boston
Tom, please pass me the salt
That wouldn't make any sense
Didn't Tom say Mary left?
How many pizzas did you order?
Do you think Tom made that up?
Here's your receipt
Don't buy more than you need
Is Tom still in the army?
Tom's death was predictable
Did you add Tom to our group?
The concert's about to start
Grass won't grow here
What vegetables does Tom like?
Isn't that just wonderful?
Did anyone see Tom yesterday?
You'll always be in my heart
Before you go, buy me a stuff
My French isn't so good
Is my sentence correct?
It's not rocket science!
We're going to make some tea
It's very important for me
Do you like the soup?
Is the soup delicious?
You aren't my husband anymore
Tom didn't bring me the book
Tom said that he's satisfied
Do you have a needle for me?
You're unlikely to like this
Why are you never satisfied?
You're as white as a ghost
How much does this fish cost?
Could I put this here?
How was your Solstice?
Tom didn't enjoy the concert
We're very careful drivers
I'll wait until Tom comes
Tom wasn't honest with me
Tom is very accident-prone
You'll never understand this
I'll have to help Tom
That's your cat, isn't it?
You've already said too much
We're in a club
We're in a group
Things don't happen by magic
You're a very kind person
You're a really kind person
You've got a good heart
She's got a good heart
I've been busy all evening
That's your dog, isn't it?
Tom doesn't want to play darts
It's just what you need
That book's over there
None of these books are Tom's
I'd like to see Tom tomorrow
There weren't any cats there
Who did Tom teach?
Tom's laughter is annoying
We didn't know Tom needed help
Tom won't let Mary tease John
Isn't that a bit extreme?
Why are you so stressed out?
Did Tom write a letter?
You'll regret this someday
I won't speak to Tom anymore
You came by train, didn't you?
I'll have Tom come
Tom won't let Mary tease you
I'm a student, too
Where's the maid of honor?
Tom's arrest was unexpected
Who'll write the report?
Where's the conference room?
Dogs can't climb up walls
Get back!
Where's my bottle?
Have you seen my bottle?
I don't have grandchildren
Interesting, Don.
Don, even this pillow here?
It's pantheism
What about panentheism?
The telly's on the blink again
It is!
Has he already arrived?
He's just missed the bus
I feel as if we've already met
She's just gone inside
He's just gone inside
Has she contacted you?
Has she been in touch?
Has he been in touch?
Has he been in touch with you?
Has he contacted you?
She's got grey hair
He's got grey hair
He's been sacked
She's been sacked
She's been made redundant
He's been made redundant
She's just arrived
Do you sell home-grown food?
Do they sell home-grown food?
Do you support City or Rovers?
I'm Bristol born and bred.
City or Rovers?
City all the way.
City or Rovers?
It's murky outside
They can't afford a holiday
Winter Solstice is 21 December
Have you forgotten that song?
Did you forget that song?
He's been laid off
I see them, indeed
It's not like that in Japan
Algeria's moment has come
He's the Goebbels of the tribe
It's time to learn German
I'd study if I were you
I'd be careful if I were you
I'm becoming just like Tom
It's time to learn Russian
We're part of a group
Um, excuse me
What line is this?
I was born in São Paulo
Don't listen to Tom
In theory, it's possible
A pillow and a blanket, please
Listen well!
You've caught the thief
You won't find that here
The noes have it !
Why do I have to pick Tom up?
The noes have it !
The noes have it !
Don't screw around with me
Has he had lunch?
Has she had lunch?
What have you got in mind?
Has he already finished?
Has she already finished?
It's pouring down with rain
It's chucking it down
They're not all bad
He's got his pyjamas on
She's got her pyjamas on
Let's have a kickabout
I've just got up
We've just got here
I've just got here
She's just got here
He's just got here
You've just got here
They've just got here
It's not the 19th century
It isn't the 19th century
Don't you, Tom?
Don't you want to sleep?
Let's go to the theater
I'm not watching the TV
He's playing soccer
The panel said: High voltage!
Warning!
Fatal danger!
Do you believe in vampires?
That's what we're counting on
Does the lift work?
By force!

That's not what surprises me
That's not what surprised me
Did you buy what you wanted?
I'm trying a new recipe
Let's discuss this tomorrow
You'll see me again soon
I'm afraid I can't afford it
I'm looking for my laptop
Don't stop there
I'm growing rice
Tom couldn't pick the lock
There's no need to continue
She's praying
They're praying
Do you pray?
Do you pray every day?
Why are you threatening me?
Do no take my life!
Anyway, it is better to hurry
He drank too much!
That's a surprising statement
We won't talk about it anymore
Likewise!
Can you pack this suitcase?
We're at the dawn of a new era
That's the point of the game
Let's discuss this over coffee
If I'm wrong, I'll admit it
I couldn't tell them apart
At first, I felt very lonely
I don't watch much television
I didn't put in enough milk
I didn't add enough salt
I didn't add enough milk
That's my third win
It's snack time
Get that mongrel out of here!
Turn on your flashing lights!
From where did you know that?
Ziri's body suddenly shook
Hello world!
Finally, Ziri released Rima
Rima called her ex-boyfriend
Ziri remembered Rima's number
Ziri's sword is in the cave
Ziri wouldn't get into trouble
Ziri's strength dissipated
Ziri wasn't strong enough
Ziri can't touch the door
Ziri checked Rima's condition
Ziri saw Rima's body
Ziri will go to the mountain.*
Ziri came to Rima's aid
Ziri made swords.$*
Ziri didn't flinch
Ziri saved Rima's village
Ziri knew Rima's daughter
Ziri attacked Rima's bodyguard
Ziri's bar was closed
Ziri is Rima's bodyguard
Ziri didn't plan this
Ziri is actually Rima's son
Ziri barged in, uninvited
Ziri's horse is not very far
Ziri fought Walid's army
Ziri didn't lose his cool
Ziri hasn't seen his father
Ziri slashed Rima's cheek
Ziri cut Rima's hair
Ziri didn't fight back
Hello, Hugo
I decide here, who does what
I can't really describe that
What does the menu include?
Is there some more coffee?
Why do you doubt it?
Did you come to help me?
Can I speak with Miss Brown?
Answer please, fast
Put on a muffler!
When is breakfast?
They have won!
Oh, no idea!
Hide your name tag!
Why are you so cunning?
Do you walk?
Which hospital are you in?
Does she know that you know?
Are you sure it was John?
I don't like being in debt
Ask her to wait, please
Tie it well in your ears!
Would you like to lie down?
Does she still sleep?
Long live the bridal couple!
How so?
Do you not want to beg?
Are you heathen?
It should not happen again!
When do you stop?
It is messed up!
Do homework!
Which do you prefer?
Did you see it happening?
Other cities, other peoples
Come to me, or I come to you
I'm not a threat to you
I'm a mermaid
I'm not a good man
Just a second, please
I'm not a tech genius like you
I'm registered
I'm not registered
I haven't registered yet
I'm already registered
Repeat that, please
I'm hooked
Do you have a cheaper one?
Tom said he'd give Mary a call
Tom said he'd call Mary
I'm a shepherd
How far is the station?
I'm a star
Let me see it, please
Tom lacks self-confidence
I'm a rock
I'm not a grownup
How often does Tom go abroad?
I'm not a cop, all right?
Who wrote this speech?
Whose radio is that?
The meeting's at 2:30
I'm not a photographer
I'm not a good photographer
I'm an alien
I'm not a good guy
I'm not a guy
I'm a girl
I'm stressed
I'm not a programmer
They didn't have anything else
When does it open?
It opens at nine.
Is this your drawing?
Yeah, how did you guess?
Tom's car got repossessed
Tom's car got repoed
Is this something you drew?
Tom's house got foreclosed on
Don't ring me any more
Don't phone me any more
Don't lose your handbag
I can't do it any more
I don't do it any more
I'm not doing this any more
He's at home at the moment
He's not at home at the moment
I won't practise today
I'm not practising today
Were you guys close?
I can't see you any more
I'm not so sure any more
How long will you be at home?
I suppose I should've known
I probably should've known
It's not important any more
Is your dad inside?
Can you drive a manual?
Well, I must say goodbye
No one's at home
No one's in
There's no one in
What do I do first?
What should I do first?
There's no one at home
What do I need to do first?
Will it take much time?
Pity that it's not like that
Pity it's not like that
May I park here?
No, you may not.
Can I park here?
No, you can't.
You're expecting too much
I'm going to hospital
He wasn't at his best
It costs about 30 euros
That costs about 30 euros
Is there a double room?
We're seeing Tom tomorrow
What do they hope for?
Are the ducks flying?
How times change!
Will you promise that?
See!
We ought to stop and rest.
Was the girl still sleeping?
What could it mean?
It's called betrayal, Tom
What is it?" she whispered
Could we go in?
Why do you need Tom's things?
Was it a piano?" she wondered
Is he your husband?
My!" said the girl
How terrible!
What do you think she meant?
It's quite common
He's been good to me
Tell her I'll call her back
Today, we got some sad news
Does this look strange?
Is this weird?
I'm concerned about my future
I think they're both good
I've been a bit busy lately
I haven't yet received a reply
How far is it to Tom's house?
Where did you learn it?
Did you take it home?
Did you take them home?
Did you bring them home?
Tom banged on Mary's door
I haven't checked my email yet
We're not children anymore
I don't want to say hello
I'm thirsty
Bring me a beer!
Do you know a Kabyle recipe?
She's at home at the moment
Take a shower!
You doughnut!
I'm one of your friends
It's a London thing
Let me do my job!
Yes, she did.
What do you do at school?
Will you be busy this evening?
I'm not a bad kid
Right this way, please
I'm the hero
Is something going on here?
Do you like to get up early?
Do you often get up early?
I'm a bad guy
Shall I call a cab?
Who took those apples?
Who's taken those apples?
Who has taken those apple?
Have you settled in well?
It's time to work together
Where is home?
I've lost track of the days
Let's eat already
I didn't think it'd be so full
They've united against him
I'm at home all day today
I'll be at home all day today
They're getting dressed
I can't see a thing
I can't see anything
Do we have a doctor on board?
How can you hear him?
I'm not an accountant
Can I have a receipt?
I'm not a beginner, you know
I'll visit you next Monday
Can this be repaired?
Can this be fixed?
They're not alone!
Is it worth it to study Latin?
I'm going for some coffee
Didn't you tell him?
Do I have to go study?
How do I go to the office?
But I couldn't do it
It's so far away
I'm seeing a problem
It's not true that it's Friday
They're very sensible boys
I'm going to redo it
It's customary
Do you want it?
Are you Mary's brother?
No, I'm her colleague.
What is the number of guests?
Who is coming to lunch?
Regular petrol, full please
I'm not clogging your pipes
I'm not setting you on fire
I'm not lovable
As I expected, she phoned
I didn't change anyone
I'm not clogging their pipes
What do you want?
To forget it.
I ate lunch at 12:30
I ate lunch at twelve-thirty
Ziri arrived at Rima's house
Suddenly, Ziri shot Rima
Suddenly, Ziri's phone rang
Suddenly, Ziri kissed Rima
Luckily, the police came
Suddenly, Ziri woke up
Ziri's dog ran excitedly
Is there any more coffee?
Could it be a scam?
How wide are you making it?
Why don't you write to us?
Do you live far from here?
Who is this muckraker?
Where are your folks?
Is this a school?
May I ask what this is about?
How much time will it take?
Who's coming to lunch?
Can they say these things?
The harder, the better
The tougher, the better
It's very near
Did you buy a new house?
Yes, I bought one.
It's not far away
Do you know how to play cards?
But that's none of my business
Granny!
I didn't eat breakfast either
We won't talk on that subject
I'm not an adherent of Islam
Won't they be busy tomorrow?
I can't do it
I'm just so exhausted
I've left my mobile at home
She can't handle the tension
She can't deal with tension
I've got one pair of gloves
Why do you listen to him?
Why do you listen to her?
I'm staying until evening
I'm staying until the evening
Morning, everyone!
Slept well?
Had nice dreams?
Good morning, everyone
Speak then!
Is it really all free?
Have you cleaned the cooker?
The sauce is delicious!
What do you want then?
Do not be hateful!
Well, I'm shattered
Well, I'm knackered
I call the girl, and it comes
Long live Dan!
Are the glasses fit for him?
Do you agree to this proposal?
It's chilly today
Whatever happens, stay calm
Where do these things belong?
Where do these belong?
Where does this belong?
When will you be arriving?
Who's in charge now?
Who's that handsome man?
I am Noelia, and you?
Let us sit!
Done with dreaming!
That's not bad either
That's not as good as this one
That's what the film's about
Have you not heard the news?
When do I have to leave?
That's my friend's house
You didn't listen to me
I'm an ambitious person
I'll find out who killed Tom
It isn't very impressive
It's not very impressive
You're an irresponsible person
Let's see if this works now
Let's see if this works
You're not as big as Tom
You're not as big as Tom is
I won't be much longer
He founded a start-up
I'd love to hear your opinion
You've failed once again
I'm not as big as Tom
I guess you know why I'm here
Germany won the 2014 World Cup
It can't happen here
That won't happen here
That's unlikely to happen here
I don't live there any more
Tell me what's happened
Would you like a straw?
Ziri's jam was ready
Ziri sold Rima's jam
Ziri knew about Nuja's pizza
Ziri has a house, too
Suddenly, the lights went on
I don't know what I will do
Open this door!" she commanded
Let me out of here at once.
It's my party
Show me another camera, please
When's the post office open?
Tom wasn't here for some time
I don't have time for you,Tom
That's very inefficient
You can't save everyone
Who's that guy in the mask?
One can't save everyone
What is a tensor?
That's my favorite bar
I'll come see you next Monday
That's a camphor tree
Is it very far?
How do you like this place?
Is it still open?
Is the barbershop still open?
I'm not high
I'm coming up
We're pro-sex-work
It's a wild turkey!
Why do you keep believing me?
That boy doesn't have a mother
I'm not crying
Come on, don't be exaggerating
Tom called.
You don't say!
Pretty please!
I've got a hangover today
It'll be difficult to find Tom
I've got the sniffles
Stop that nail-biting habit
I've got Tom on the phone
I've got Tom on the blower
I don't want it any more
I don't want this any more
I suppose I'd better be off
We've got it worked out
It's an honour to meet you
We're going dancing tomorrow
You've seen her, haven't you?
Do you remember what he said?
And that's not all
I can't explain what I saw
He has up to 500 books
A few days, and you'll be well
A few days, and you'll be fine
I don't know who that was
I'm fine
How are you?
I'm well
How are you?
Please explain what's at stake
Slept well?
Have you slept well?
We'll know tomorrow
Do you want a piece?
Do you want a bit?
I've got used to the cold
He weighed 11 stone
Tom opens doors for me.
Tom?
How can you be so naive?
Why not?
I'm sure she'll like it.
We should've gone by train
It's not really random
Let's discuss this next Monday
We're overwhelmed
I'll be back before dawn
I didn't have time for lunch
French isn't at all difficult
May I join you for lunch?
Be my guest.
Are you alright?
I'm fine.
Can you drop me off first?
I haven't see you in ages!
When do you have gymnastics?
Soccer practice is at 4:00
His alibi doesn't hold up
Ziri didn't rob a bank
At that moment, Ziri walked in
Ziri's phone rang
You!
What?
Get out!
Ziri couldn't keep up
Don't believe your eyes
It's beyond repair
I don't like anyone else
There's God and energy
It's illegal and Tom knows it
Don't forget how to do it
When?
Never.
Don't be so rude!
I don't remember meeting Tom
Stay down, or I'll shoot you
Europe doesn't exist
That's what I'm telling you
I'm a Muscovite
Doesn't he love his dog?
Doesn't she love her dog?
I'm a casual gamer
Don't stay out long
You're having twins
You're having triplets
You're definitely having twins
I'm hearing two heartbeats
You're having twins
Who broke the vase?
Tom did.
Ziri was on the bank's website
You're dumb and ugly
Is Ziri always like this?
Of all the girls, why Rima?
What am I, your maid?
Ziri's letter arrived
Ziri didn't get Rima's number
Ziri grabbed Rima's hand
Ziri didn't say hi
Ziri can't wait
Ziri's wine smells like vomit
Ziri's foot has swollen
Ziri can't leave Rima alone
Ziri's journey continued
Ziri can't help Rima anymore
Ziri can't walk properly
Ziri called Rima's name
Ziri rejected Rima's tribe
Ziri seconded Rima's idea
Ziri wasn't wounded
Ziri doesn't fear Rima
Ziri's approach was different
Ziri's tribe will accept Rima
Ziri killed Rima's parents
Ziri recognized Rima's scar
Ziri proved Rima's words right
Ziri is neither man, not demon
Was Tom bored?
I didn't stay to watch
I can't get my socks off
Let's go with that
Let's go with this
Don't camp here
I think you're wrong, Tom
Where should I put my tray?
We're lagging behind
It's not me who speaks French
Didn't Tom used to say that?
Who's that idiot?
Are you still half asleep?
Tom won't repeat it again
Oh shit, I'm sorry
I'm a criminal
It's not all that important
I'm not a mathematician
I'm not a sociopath
Pink and yellow are your life!
What do you mean, exactly?
Does it ever rain in Greece?
What did they use as a pillow?
I saw Tom's book that you lost
I don't live here any more
I don't need them any more
Tom hasn't rung Mary yet
Tom hasn't phoned Mary yet
Tom said he'd ring at 2.30
Tom said he'd phone at 2.30
Tom said he'd ring at half two
Are you waiting for anyone?
I suppose I'd better be going
They're a complete shower
I'm making a paper aeroplane
Why did you vote for it?
I need your help, Mary.
You can't do a thing yourself
Please!
Where's the telephone here?
My bra is too small.
Could you turn the radio down?
I don't often complain
Which word fits better here?
What word fits better here?
I'm free after lunch
Let's go
Ziri doesn't have maple syrup
That's certainly not true
We don't need them any more
Was your project approved?
What type of mango Ziri has?
Ziri's cherries are larger
Tom isn't afraid of the crisis
That's how I got there
It's a nightmare
Tom hasn't ordered yet
You don't have to believe Tom
Let's walk a little slower
Maybe you'll get the job
Have you read the script?
Who wrote this script?
Let's exercise together
Will Tom go, too?
Is Tom planning to go, too?
Is Tom planning to go?
I'm as sick as a dog
The report wasn't true
What will the dessert be?
What happened to my money?
We're relaxing
Love-fifteen, ball was long
As I said, there is no problem
Let us follow them!
We won't swim in the river
Long live the early waking!
This film is terrible!
They talk non-stop
Let us be silent!
Do not go so fast!
Stop judging me!
Tom weighs seventy-four kilos
Will humans colonize space?
Will people colonize the Moon?
Why did you leave Tom there?
That's an awfully fishy story
Did you like the food?
We'll do it again
Will we survive?
I can't pretend anymore
Why did you do that?
Tom isn't my uncle
He's my cousin
I doubt you'll like it
I've had bad luck
I've had some bad luck
I can't play with Tom
Tom didn't speak much
Am I really in trouble?
Let's set up camp here
What's the suitcase's weight?
I've made a miscalculation
Where can I find halal food?
Do you have halal food?
Do you cook halal food?
Do you serve halal food?
Ziri doesn't drink alcohol
He's Muslim
Ziri doesn't eat pork
It's not permissible in Islam
Can I pray here?
You can pray everywhere.
Ziri's troops came here
A gunshot was heard at 4:00 pm
Ziri's parents left town
Ziri wasn't going too far
Ziri's cabin isn't on the map
What was in the water?
Was it an animal or a person?
It's that sound again
Listen, it's that sound again
Ziri didn't answer right away
Ziri pushed Rima's gun down
Ziri didn't even say a word
Hippies.
Pardon me?
Those were hippies.
Ziri had a night-vision scope
That wasn't at all a gazelle
That was Ziri's logic
Ziri didn't hear any footsteps
Ziri didn't move a muscle
Fortunately, nothing was taken
Ziri's scream was much closer
It was in April of 2004
Ziri was creeped out, no doubt
Ziri wasn't in the cave alone
Ziri hit Rima's face
Ziri didn't look down
Why was Ziri in there?
Ziri's car was empty
Ziri didn't find them
Ziri attempted to call 911
How bad is Ziri's injury?
Ziri was very touchy-flirty
Ziri doesn't fish
Ziri's responses were dry
Ziri can't let Rima leave
Ziri's boat hit the dirt
Ziri wasn't about to go inside
Ziri didn't even turn around
Ziri didn't turn on any lights
Ziri's car started with ease
Now it's pitch black
Ziri made it to Rima's bed
Ziri didn't see Rima anywhere
Ziri's mom phoned the police
Ziri's cheeks were red
Where will Ziri be sleeping?
Ziri wasn't going to get lost
Why anyone else would be here?
Ziri stood there, watching
Ziri heard kids' laughter
Ziri didn't open his door
Ziri didn't show his face
Ziri had a deep man's voice
Ziri was in Rima's backyard
Did you download Minecraft?
Why did you drink?
Your dad makes wraps?
I had to do Tom's job
Why didn't you introduce us?
Sorry, I forgot it completely
Does he know any other words?
I think this'll be fun for you
I'll bankrupt you
I can't hear the TV
Is Mum home?
Is Mum at home?
Was Tom there too?
I'm a townie
They're barmy
I'll be here until October
There's no more room
There isn't any more room
What do your children do?
You aren't irreplaceable
Tom's face is sunburned
I think I'm flexible
Was Tom told the truth?
It'll be painful
I'm going home tomorrow
I'm going to take a break
Are we going to survive?
How did Tom end up in Boston?
How did Tom end up there?
It's way too hot in there
Don't ask me what I did
Don't ask me why I did that
Was Tom there, too?
He's always getting confused
There's only one way
Who set up this server?
Does it feel OK?
I hope it's not too painful
Is it feeling sore here?
Ziri doesn't have any issues
Ziri's wound was bleeding
Ziri isn't tolerating the pain
Ziri's finger is sore
It's drizzly weather today
Tom's doing something
Moaning won't help
Complaining won't help
Is this building open to all?
Does he sing well?
It's possible she's ill
Seriously, you are daft
Shall I ask?
Should I ask?
They won't be ready
Suddenly, her face went pale
I'm going to the shop
What do we need?
Does anyone want to get in?
Does anyone want to get on?
Is your flat big?
Tom's telephone is ringing
Are you inside?
Are you indoors?
Where can I find a chemist's?
Where can I find a pharmacy?
Is he going to coming back?
Will he come back?
Why are you so odd?
Who is allowed to vote?
Who decides that?
That'll take all day
She's clever
She says she's safe
Is he popular?
Is it happening again?
Have you got any ice cubes?
Do you have any ice cubes?
The thermostat doesn't work
I've replaced the kitchen tap
Where have I left my mobile?
Where did I leave my mobile?
Why did you vote against it?
Ziri hasn't been camping since
Ziri was a sketchy-looking guy
Ziri headed to the pool, first
Ziri doesn't see that
Ziri's door was left open
Ziri went to the cul-de-sac
That wasn't even Ziri's idea
Ziri was at Rima's window
Is she Adam's girlfriend?
They'll tell you tomorrow
She's mean all the time
Let's keep her
He'll be there for a week
I think she's on her period
I believe she's on her period
Okay, we'll take note of it
Okay, we'll take note of that
I'm sick of it
I can't do this
I'm quitting
It's splendid
Don't be so angry, my love
Don't be so angry, darling
Don't be so angry, sweetheart
Don't be so angry, my dear
In summer, I only wear white
In summer, all I wear is white
They can't hide the truth
They can't conceal the truth
They're in the street
Thomas doesn't speak English
Do you have another?
Have you got another?
Have you got another one?
You'll find it's easy
Do you sell fresh eggs?
I'm almost always punctual
I'm almost always on time
She's proud of Mary
I don't want anything sweet
You're the love of my life
Yes, that's how it works
Ha ha!
Ha ha!
She couldn't hide her nerves
Who have I married?
Whom have I married?
Who did I marry?
Whom did I marry?
I can't hold it anymore
I'm meeting him on Friday
Can we go much higher?
Thanks for the recommendation!
I'm learning to speak Tagalog
Take it, as a keepsake from me
Raise the drawbridge!
I've got a witness
It's a great list
That's a good list
I don't like this keyboard
My keyboard isn't working
It's very pleasant today
Don't leave
I'll be back
Tom's daughter is almost three
I'm going to make dinner
Tom's voice is very nice
Who set this server up?
There's a killer on the loose
Did you do the thing?
Does she need glasses?
It's a bike pump
See you next week, Tom!
Ziri's tent had mesh windows
Ziri's tent has no windows
Ziri just set there, paralyzed
Ziri's severed finger was gone
Why was Ziri doing that?
Ziri's clothes were dirty
Ziri's windshield was smashed
Ziri's phone was gone
Ziri didn't see that guy again
Ziri's girlfriend was at work
Ziri's jaw dropped
Ziri couldn't find Rima
Ziri noticed Rima's blue eyes
Ziri can't stop Rima
Ziri understands Rima's anger
Ziri can't reach the jar
Ziri borrowed Rima's ship
Ziri's treasure is in Algiers
Ziri's skin condition worsened
Ziri ripped off Rima's mask
He's always getting mixed up
Did Tom's advice help Mary?
Doesn't that drive you mad?
I think it's kind of nice
Don't be selfish
Find out what's happening
Good night, sweet dreams
Who is Mouloud Mammeri?
At what time shall we go?
When will Tom understand it?
Are your children all right?
Are your children OK?
How are you my beloved?
Don't jump, Tom
May I open it?
Can we open it?
I'll be back before Tom
What beautiful lips!
Like hell!
She's not improving
Where did he go?
I'm not motivated enough today
Don't jump!
Who's allowed to vote?
Will he be coming back?
How did you like the meal?
We'll pay by cheque
I'd like to go to Spain
In a cocktail bar?
How did you know?
It's brass monkeys at home
It's freezing at home
He's not from the north
He's from Southampton!
He's not the Messiah
Mary hasn't got much to say
Mary doesn't have much to say
We'll be going with Tom
We're going to go with Tom
And how did you answer?
And how did you reply?
And what was your reply?
And what was your answer?
Don't do it like that
It's almost midday
John!
You've got to help me
Mary's turfed me out
Anything you want.
How do you know he needs it?
You've got a good vocabulary
A whole bagful.
What are they hoping for?
He's almost always sad
He's almost always unhappy
No, I'm afraid I haven't yet.
How did you find me?
Did Tom tell you where I was?
The gazelle didn't budge
Don't you mean 'edgeways'?
Ziri's leg were killing him
Ziri's eyes shot open
Ta-ra!
Ziri's truck started just fine
Bye.
You what?
You've got that wrong
I've got to be somewhere else.
You're not serious, are you?
Hello, Anna!
It's me, Mary
Bye!
Ziri knew that wasn't Rima

It was probably a hyena.
Ziri didn't show fear
Ziri can't go back

I'm 6'3
He's in the ICU
He's in intensive care

Tom Jackson?
Is it really you?
What's guano?
Should Tom Jackson resign?

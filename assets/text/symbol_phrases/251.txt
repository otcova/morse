I didn't think you were awake
I didn't think I had a choice
I didn't tell the whole truth
I didn't stop the car in time
I didn't see the truck coming
I didn't recognize my ex-wife
I didn't play rugby yesterday
I didn't plan to go to Boston
I didn't need to speak French
I didn't much like what I saw
I didn't know you were joking
I didn't know you were hungry
I didn't know you were asleep
I didn't know you knew French
I didn't know just what to do
I didn't know how lucky I was
I didn't know about the party
I didn't help wash the dishes
I didn't have to wait so long
I didn't have to wait in line
I didn't have time to do that
I didn't have any place to go
I didn't have a place to stay
I didn't have a job last year
I didn't feel pain right away
I didn't feel like exercising
I didn't feel like doing that
I didn't explain it very well
I didn't do that the easy way
I didn't do that deliberately
I didn't deny that I did that
I didn't come home until 2:30
I didn't care if I won or not
I didn't believe what I heard
I didn't actually do anything
I did that from 12:00 to 2:30
I couldn't find what I wanted
I could've refused to do that
I can't continue working here
I can't come because I'm sick
I can't be at today's meeting
I can't afford to get married
I can't afford to buy a house
I believe that'll happen soon
How often do you have parties?
How often do you go to dances?
How many tickets will you buy?
How many hot dogs did you buy?
How many children do you want?
How long do I have to do that?
How about doing that tomorrow?
How about doing that together?
How I can lose weight quickly?
Have you taught French before?
Have you found a solution yet?
Has a solution been found yet?
Had you ever done that before?
Don't you have to do that now?
Don't forget to shut the gate
Don't forget to buy some eggs
Don't ask me stupid questions
Doing that's really very easy
Doing that's always an option
Doing that's a very good idea
Doing that won't be very easy
Doing that isn't allowed here
Do you think we could do that?
Do you think monkeys are cute?
Do you really wish to do that?
Do you really think it's safe?
Do you often use a dictionary?
Do you intend to do that here?
Do both of you work in Boston?
Do I need a permit to do that?
Do I have to do that tomorrow?
Didn't I tell you I'd do that?
Did you receive an invitation?
Did you come to Boston by bus?
Could you please come with me?
Could you come to Boston, too?
Can we be in Boston by Monday?
At what time will you do that?
Are you still teaching French?
Are you still a horse trainer?
Are you reluctant to go there?
Are you obliged to do that?
Are you a regular blood donor?
Your singing voice isn't bad
Your injuries aren't serious
You're too young to buy beer
You're too stupid to do that
You're skeptical, aren't you?
You're quite shy, aren't you?
You're mad at us, aren't you?
You're a very strange person
You're a very selfish person
You're a very patient person
You're a very beautiful girl
You're a runaway, aren't you?
You're a really good manager
You're a pretty good swimmer
You're a pitcher, aren't you?
You're a pianist, aren't you?
You're a lot older than I am
You're a good French speaker
You're a gambler, aren't you?
You're a fairly good drummer
You're a charmer, aren't you?
You're a butcher, aren't you?
You'll never have to do that
You'll need to do that again
You'd better not do that now
You'd better do that at once
You won't be able to do that
You still do that, don't you?
You shouldn't think about it
You said I shouldn't do that
You quit your job, don't you?
You like red wine, don't you?
You felt nervous, didn't you?
You drive to work, don't you?
You do that a lot, don't you?
You can't take pictures here
Would you mind if I did that?
Would you all please go home?
Would it be OK if I did that?
Will you be doing that again?
Will it be ready on the 20th?
Why would we have to do that?
Why would I buy that for you?
Why don't you to relax a bit?
Why do you need two bicycles?
Why aren't you in Boston now?
Why are you coming to Boston?
Whose car is that over there?
Who'll go to Boston with you?
Who'll be in Boston with you?
Who told you I could do that?
Who brought the marshmallows?
Who braids your hair for you?
Which way is the post office?
Which parking space is yours?
Which pair of shoes is yours?
Where's the manager's office?
Where will you be in October?
Where in Boston did you live?
Where do you usually do that?
Where did you stay in Boston?
Where did you go last summer?
When will you come to Boston?
When are you going to finish?
What you're doing isn't safe
What prompted you to do that?
What did you say to the boss?
What did that suggest to you?
Were you wearing a seat belt?
Were you in Boston yesterday?
Were you in Boston on Monday?
Were you in Boston last year?
Were you in Boston last week?
We've decided not to do that
We've already discussed this
We'll eat dinner early today
We'll do that again sometime
We must've missed each other
We don't need to go anywhere
We don't have to do that now
This doesn't taste very good
They've just made me manager
There's only one thing to do
There's nothing for me to do
There's a tollbooth up ahead
There's a roadblock up ahead
That's the woman I talked to
That's the reason I did that
That's the hat I want to buy
That's the car I want to buy
That's not what I want to do
That's not what I need to do
That's not what I have to do
Please don't do that so much
Please do that tomorrow, too
Our troubles aren't over yet
October 20th was a rainy day
My suitcase isn't very heavy
My house isn't far from here
My house burned down in 2013
My help isn't needed anymore
My contract won't be renewed
Maybe I need to do that, too
Maybe I have to do that, too
Let's not study French today
Let's not speak French today
Let's go to Boston next week
Let's do that again tomorrow
It's way too late to do that
It's tough to make ends meet
It's too late to do that now
It's too cold to do that now
It's time to stop doing that
It's illegal to do that here
It's OK to do that, isn't it?
It's OK if you don't do that
It'll be possible to do that
It'll be good if you do that
It'll be fun to visit Boston
Is there water in the bucket?
Is there a desk in your room?
Is it dangerous if I do that?
If you're sleepy, take a nap
If it snows, I won't do that
I've had to postpone my trip
I've got a very bad headache
I've found something strange
I've done that several times
I've decided to visit Boston
I've decided to teach French
I've been waiting since 2:30
I've been robbed three times
I've been ordered to do that
I've been doing that all day
I'm very hesitant to do that
I'm trying to be cooperative
I'm too young to get married
I'm too young to drive a car
I'm too tired to do that now
I'm too tired to do anything
I'm too depressed to do that
I'm to blame for all of this
I'm the person who does that
I'm sure that'll change soon
I'm sure that you'll like it
I'm sure that that'll happen
I'm still willing to do that
I'm quiet whenever I do that
I'm planning to teach French
I'm planning to study French
I'm planning to speak French
I'm often invited to parties
I'm not very sure about that
I'm not the least bit hungry
I'm not permitted to do that
I'm not in a good mood today
I'm not as rich as you think
I'm not able to speak French
I'm helping as much as I can
I'm happy whenever I do that
I'm going to have to do that
I'm a freelance photographer
I'll wait for you until 2:30
I'll show you how to do that
I'll go to Boston next month
I'd rather not do that today
I'd rather not do that again
I'd rather do that next week
I'd rather do that by myself
I'd never ever do that again
I'd like to do that with you
I'd like to do that tomorrow
I'd like to do that sometime
I'd like to buy that for you
I'd like both sugar and milk
I'd be opposed to doing that
I wouldn't do that by myself
I won't try to do that again
I won't teach French, either
I won't teach French anymore
I won't study French, either
I won't let you guys do that
I won't let you go to Boston
I won't go to Boston, either
I won't go to Boston anymore
I won't force you to do that
I won't do that until Monday
I won't do that anytime soon
I won't come to Boston again
I won't be staying in Boston
I wish I hadn't been so late
I wasn't supposed to do that
I wasn't in Boston last year
I wasn't in Boston last week
I wasn't at school yesterday
I wasn't at school last week
I wasn't a very good student
I wanted to go, but I didn't
I want to leave, but I can't
I thought I'd try to do that
I thought I wouldn't do that
I think that I won't do that
I think it's time to give up
I still haven't paid my rent
I still haven't eaten dinner
I started doing that in 2013
I should've never been fired
I should've done that sooner
I should've done that myself
I should've done much better
I should've been helping you
I should've been able to win
I should be back before 2:30
I really don't have a choice
I like stir-fried vegetables
I know you'd hate to do that
I know you shouldn't do that
I know you shouldn't be here
I know why you're suspicious
I know what I'm getting into
I know the job won't be easy
I know that you aren't ready
I know that I'll be punished
I know that I'll be arrested
I know it won't happen again
I know I'm going to be fired
I know I'll be here tomorrow
I just can't do that anymore
I hope you pass today's exam
I haven't yet visited Boston
I haven't yet confirmed that

How was the dance last night?

How many bananas did you buy?
How many apples did you pick?
How did you meet that friend?
Have you finished doing that?
Have you ever studied French?
Have you ever eaten dog meat?
Don't forget your sunglasses
Don't forget to mow the lawn
Doing that's a very bad idea
Doing that won't be much fun
Does your room have a carpet?
Do you still wish to do that?
Do you still want to do that?
Do you still need to do that?
Do you still have to do that?
Do you play soccer every day?
Do you enjoy teaching French?
Do you drink a lot of coffee?
Do both of you still do that?
Didn't you intend to do that?

Did you have a good vacation?
Did I really have to do that?
Could you go get that for me?
Could I borrow your scissors?
Can you speak French, please?
Can you remember their names?
Can you help me next weekend?
At what time did you do that?
Are you proposing we do that?
Are you proposing to do that?
Are you permitted to do that?
Are you miserable doing that?
Are you hesitant to go there?
Are you going to do that now?
Are we going to visit Boston?
Your performance wasn't bad
Your name isn't on the list
You've got to do that today
You've got something I want
You've been very supportive
You're too drunk to do that
You're permitted to do that
You're my uncle, aren't you?
You're doing that very well
You're being a bit snobbish
You're being a bit paranoid
You're a very sound sleeper
You're a talented young man
You're a really good singer
You're a really good dancer
You're a pretty good singer
You're a pretty good driver
You're a pastor, aren't you?
You're a good-looking woman
You're a good tennis player
You're a good soccer player
You're a good hockey player
You're a father, aren't you?
You're a doctor, aren't you?
You're a bit crazy, I think
You'd better repair it soon
You won't do that, will you?
You shouldn't do that today
You shouldn't do that again
You look like you're sleepy
You like to sing, don't you?
You like to hunt, don't you?
You like to fish, don't you?
You like to draw, don't you?
You like to cook, don't you?
You like to bowl, don't you?

You had a knife, didn't you?
You expect a lot, don't you?
You drink coffee, don't you?
You don't shave yet, do you?
You do that, too, don't you?
Will you please not do that?
Will I have time to do that?
Why would I have to do that?
Why wasn't I told this before?
Why should I stay in Boston?
Why should I come to Boston?
Why don't you do that today?
Why don't I have to do that?
Why didn't you visit Boston?
Why did you want to do that?
Why did you need to do that?
Who went to Boston with you?
Who here understands French?
Who does this hat belong to?
Who does this dog belong to?
Who does this car belong to?
Who did you learn that from?
Which wine do you like best?
Where were you last weekend?
Where did you hide my money?
Where can I put my umbrella?
When will you be doing that?

What time does the zoo open?
What size shirt do you wear?
What do you two do together?

What did you do after lunch?
What color do you like best?
What are you most afraid of?
We've both worked in Boston
We've been asked to do that
We're trying to do too much
We'd better do that quickly
We won't ever do that again
We should've studied harder
We didn't have enough money
We didn't do that yesterday
We can't come to Boston now
This hole isn't deep enough
This book isn't interesting
They're testing new weapons
They're often seen together
There's plenty of wine left
There's no way I'll do that
There's no rush
There's no news from Boston
The rain hasn't stopped yet
The noise doesn't bother me
That doesn't any make sense
Shouldn't you do that today?
Shouldn't you be doing that?
My plan is perfect, I think
Most people here can't swim
Maybe you'd like to do that
Mary is a farmer's daughter
Many people don't know that
Make sure you don't do that
Let's go out to eat tonight
Let's go out on the veranda
Let's go out on the terrace
Let's buy half a watermelon
Let's buy a box of cherries
It's too hot to do that now
It's snowing here in Boston
It's raining here in Boston
It's probably OK to do that
It's now my turn to do that
It's not always easy to win
It's easy for me to do that
It's bad manners to do that
It's already taken me hours
It's almost time to do that
It's a good idea to do that
Tom, you don't have to do that
Tom's technique is pretty good
Tom's room needs to be cleaned
Tom's house is just over there
Is there any ice cream left?
Tom's guitar playing isn't bad
Is it snowing now in Boston?
Tom's car was stolen last week
Is it raining now in Boston?
Tom's bad eye is his right one
I've seen people doing that
Tom wouldn't tell me his plans
I've never worked in Boston
Tom would've wanted to do that
I've never seen you do that
I've learned how to do that
I've got to stop doing that
I've done that once already
I've considering doing that
I'm very tempted to do that
I'm very anxious to do that
Tom won't study French anymore
I'm trying to be optimistic
Tom won't speak French anymore
I'm too young to drink beer
Tom won't likely be suspicious
I'm too drunk to drive home
Tom won't likely be sleepy yet
I'm the perfect man for you
Tom won't likely be reasonable
I'm sure that's what I need
Tom won't likely be interested
I'm sure that'll change now
Tom won't likely be here today
I'm studying to be a doctor
Tom won't likely be handcuffed
I'm on my way to Boston now
Tom won't likely be frightened
I'm not very good at sports
Tom won't likely be doing that
I'm not sure how to respond
Tom won't likely be back today
I'm not planning to do that
Tom won't ever do that anymore
I'm not as old as you think
Tom won't do that until Monday
I'm not a very good swimmer
Tom won't be home this weekend
I'm not a good chess player
Tom wishes he'd done that, too
I'm much better than before
Tom wishes he hadn't done that
I'm happy we came to Boston
Tom wished he hadn't done that
I'm happy that you did that
I'm going to go and do that
Tom will return this week, too
I'm glad you didn't do that
I'm glad that didn't happen
I'm feeling a little sleepy
I'm feeling a little hungry
I'm doing what I need to do
I'm doing that this morning
I'm being as quiet as I can
I'm a very impatient person
I'll try my best to do that
I'll study French next year
I'll probably do that today
I'll do that this afternoon
I'll do that if you help me
I'll do that again tomorrow
I'll be doing that tomorrow
I'd visit Boston if I could
I'd rather not do that here
I'd rather do that tomorrow
I'd like you to do that now
I'd like to see you do that
Tom will go to Boston, I think
I'd like to do that for you
I'd be reluctant to do that
I wouldn't do that with you
I won't do that from now on
Tom wasn't very friendly to me
I won't be doing that again
Tom wasn't interested in music
I wish you'd leave me alone
Tom wasn't at school on Monday
I wish you'd do that for me
I wish you'd come to Boston
I wasn't willing to do that
I wasn't wearing a seatbelt
I wasn't wearing a name tag
I wasn't there this morning
Tom told me that he's unbiased
I wasn't sure what to think
Tom told me that he's unafraid
I wasn't sure what happened
Tom told me that he's ticklish
I wasn't kidding about that
Tom told me that he's prepared
I wasn't in class yesterday
I wasn't having a good time
I wasn't expecting any help
Tom told me I couldn't do that
I wasn't able to stay awake
I wasn't able to get a visa
I wasn't able to find a job
Tom still doesn't speak French
Tom should've done that sooner
I want to visit Boston, too
Tom should've done that by now
Tom should've done much better
I want to study French, too
Tom should've bought more food
Tom should've been sympathetic
Tom should've been cooperative
Tom should've been able to win
I want to go to Boston, too
Tom seldom, if ever, does that
Tom says that he won't do that
I thought you weren't awake
Tom says he's good at swimming
Tom says he's good at juggling
Tom says he's good at baseball
Tom says he's eager to do that
Tom says he'll quit doing that
Tom says he'll need to do that
I shouldn't have to do that
Tom says he'll keep doing that
I shouldn't have left early
Tom says he'll have to do that
I shouldn't have been there
Tom says he'll do that for you
I shouldn't do that anymore
Tom says he would've paid more
I should've locked the door
Tom says he won't speak French
I should've been suspicious
Tom says he can't speak French
Tom said you're not happy here
Tom said you'd do that for him
Tom said that it'd happen soon
Tom said that he won't do that
Tom said that he wasn't sleepy
Tom said that he wasn't bitter
Tom said losing isn't much fun
Tom said it's a common problem
Tom said he's ready to do that
Tom said he's glad he did that
Tom said he's done that before
Tom said he's done all of that
Tom said he's always done that
Tom said he'll quit doing that
I know you'll never do that
Tom said he'll help us do that
I know why you're terrified
Tom said he'll do that for you
I know why you're surprised
Tom said he'd unlikely do that
Tom said he'd retire this year
Tom said he'd probably do that
Tom said he'd do that tomorrow
I know what that's used for
Tom said he'd do that if I did
I know that you're bluffing
Tom said he'd do that for sure
I know that I'm replaceable
Tom said he'd do that for free
Tom said he'd buy that for you
Tom said he won't visit Boston
Tom said he won't speak French
I know it isn't a good idea
Tom said he won't go to Boston
Tom said he wasn't a terrorist
I know change won't be easy
I know I'm not welcome here
I know I'm not going to win
Tom said he didn't have a wife
Tom said he could've done that
Tom said he can't speak French
Tom said I should've done that
I hope I don't get laid off
I hope I didn't hurt anyone
I heard that you'll do that
I haven't washed the dishes
I guess I'll try doing that
Tom probably shouldn't do that

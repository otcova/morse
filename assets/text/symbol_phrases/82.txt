I am Kabyle and I love Israel.
Who gives a damn about that?
Tom doesn't floss
Tom doesn't go out very often
Tom doesn't look sad anymore
Tom doesn't love you
I am Kabyle and I love Israel.
Who cares about that?
Tom doesn't trust me
I am Kabyle and I love Israel.
Does anyone care about that?
Tom doesn't know this
Tom doesn't know this yet
Why don't we start over again?
Why don't we start right away?
I am Kabyle and I love Israel.
Who gives a damn about that?
Why don't we try to get along?
Why don't we try to stay calm?
I am Kabyle and I love Israel.
Who gives a damn about that?
Tom doesn't like birds
Why don't we wait till Monday?
Tom doesn't eat candy
Tom doesn't look tired anymore
We're ready to leave now
Tom doesn't wear a hat
Tom doesn't believe you
Why don't we eat steak?
Yanni isn't a Muslim
Yanni can't explain this
Yanni's pizza is to die for
These dates are delicious!
What a feeling!
Yanni didn't drink
Yanni doesn't eat
Yanni doesn't eat at all
Yanni doesn't fast at all
Come on, guys, help yourselves
You'll need to trust me
Do you trust me?
Sure.
Do you have the new schedule?
That's Yanni's life
It's a battle for survival
Yanni got up at 4:00 AM
Are you Muslim?
No.
Yanni is African-American
Yanni's wife is Muslim
Yanni totaled Skura's car
Is Yanni leaving?
Does Yanni live here?
Who is Muslim here?
Who is not Muslim here?
Were there any Muslims there?
We can't come
Is Tom a pacifist?
Why don't we cut class?
Tom wasn't able to fix it
I'll get Tom now
Be gone, separatists!
Didn't you burn yourself?
Why don't we eat here?
Where did you see Tom last?
It wouldn't be nice to do that
Typical sociopaths.
An intellectual terrorist.
Really?
Don't worry
Because that's what they are
Is Tatoeba a pamphlet or what?
Why don't we be quiet?
Did that happen yesterday?
She's already sleeping
Should I wake her up?
You're lucky
Were you downtown yesterday?
Why don't we relax?
Tom walks like he's an old man
You've said too much
This is Tom's life
You are my inspiration, too
We used to have an 8088
Why don't we continue?
Tom's bike is black
Yes, I do have them
I'm going for a walk!
What do you mean, 'a walk'?!
What about German?
I won't need Tom
What are we going to play?
Tom can't go out
Why don't we go again?
He's my childhood friend
She's my childhood friend
They're keeping silent
If you cheat me, I'll kill you
I don't know if I'll have kids
Does she already know?
Why don't we try this?
Tom's answer was no
Why don't we rest a while?
Why don't we leave tonight?
Why don't we see what it is?
Why don't we do it your way?
Why don't we all go together?
Tom doesn't care at all
Tom doesn't care about this
Tom doesn't care what you say
It's the short castling
It's the long castling
Surely I'm not as smart as Tom
He's problematic
She's really tall for her age
Why don't we open it?
It's Tom's problem
Am I hard to understand?
I wish I'd been born a cat
Is transparency a bad thing?
But we're not there yet
Don't mind me
I'm just venting
Don't listen to me
I'm being crazy
Do you usually wear a hat?
That'll stop Tom
There's a bus every 30 minutes
A bus comes every 30 minutes
These rules aren't very clear
Why don't we quit?
I hated the 2000s
They're selling fish and meat
She's a force of nature
I've made up my mind to resign
They're watching a movie
How do you relieve stress?
Why don't we eat?
Why is Tom staying home?
I'm going to go to bed now
If Tom were here, he'd help
Yanni didn't talk about that
That's no business of yours
Yanni doesn't remember that
It's Yanni's turn to compete
Yanni wasn't exactly sure
Yanni doesn't sure
Yanni doesn't want to drive
Yanni didn't call 911
Yanni didn't do that
Yanni didn't call for help
Why don't we play tag?
Yanni clicked on Skura's video
Yanni's father was an ENT
Yanni isn't gonna make it
Yanni didn't bring his phone
You can't complain about that!
Yanni wasn't trying very hard
Yanni can't play basketball
Yanni didn't even care
That's Yanni's story
Yanni didn't make it out
What does Yanni look?
Yanni heard Skura's words
Yanni enjoyed Skura's video
Yanni's grandfather has passed
Yanni couldn't stand
Yanni doesn't have any issues
Skura doesn't wear heels
How is that relevant here?
Yanni hasn't changed
It's a really cold April day
It's really hard to explain
Yanni's cane was broken
Yanni's face was pouring blood
Yanni's face was bloody
The bleeding isn't stopping
Yanni's stitches came out
It's very hard to see
This house is Tom's
Yanni was right.
Yanni is always right.
Whatever.
Tom can't get in
Leave us alone, please!
Why don't we sing?
In fact, Tom lied
Whose back brace is this?
It's Yanni's.
It's so rigid!
Yanni's back brace is so heavy
He no longer needs one.
We're Serbs, and you?
Should I buy a back brace?
Why should I buy a back brace?
Do I need a back brace?
Are you wearing a back brace?
Are you with me, Yanni?
This jambalaya is excellent!
Does Shunde belong to Foshan?
Is Shunde part Foshan?
She'll buy something
He wasn't wearing a belt
We miss you, old friend
We're going to miss her
Why don't we get drunk?
I have missed you too, Tom
I have missed you, all of you
It's never been clear
Could you tie me up?
Why don't we walk?
Is this your pot-bellied pig?
Do you like to gossip?
Why don't we run away?
Tom can't fix it
We hope he'll help us
Where will he put it?
Where is he going to put it?
Why are you winking at me?
Would you like to have a dog?
He's going home tomorrow
We'll stay home all Saturday
Why don't we eat pizza?
That book is Tom's
I'll take the lift
I'll go in the lift
He isn't as polite as Tom
Tom hasn't swum today
I don't smoke, but Tom does
She won't be buying any bread
They're afraid of you
What do you reckon she'll do?
When will you get up?
Tom's not at home
What day was she born on?
What day was she born?
Home at last!
Don't cut these trees down
Don't cut those trees down
He's in a really bad mood
He's in a foul mood
Tom hasn't made the beds
Tom didn't make the beds
That doesn't exist
Why don't we slow down?
And she loved him, too
Use by 20 November
I'm always confused
I'm tired of Tom
Where's the sponge?
Why don't we go on in?
I don't wear shoes
I don't believe in shoes
That's a very interesting plan
I don't like wearing shoes
Do you talk a lot?
Do you like to solve puzzles?
Why don't we try that?
Does Tom ski very well?
Do you catch colds often?
Why aren't you done yet?
You're more than a friend
Why don't we fix this?
The TV's not working
Is Tom from here?
You probably think I'm rich
No water balloons here, please
Did you hear that?
It's a water balloon.
No way!
No water balloons here.
It's icy
Yanni's car started flipping
Yanni couldn't see anything
What the heck happened?
Yanni can't tell you
Yanni called Skura's parents
Yanni can't see
Yanni saved Skura's life
There's so much blood here
Yanni doesn't know that
Is Yanni going to survive?
Yanni's face was swollen
This is Yanni's chance
Yanni's gold chain is there
Yanni hasn't seen this movie
Yanni enjoyed Skura's videos
Is Yanni from Algiers?
Why don't we do this?
Why don't we calm down?
I'm not Tom's type
We'll be happy to oblige you
I'm a Kabyle from Algeria.
You're a traitor!
Why?
Sure!
Then you're a separatist.
This is genocide!
You're a criminal!
This is completely ridiculous.
Are you out of your mind?
Stop insulting me!
You're a criminal!
You're an Islamist terrorist!
You're a bastard!
Yanni joined Skura's religion
Yanni moved to Algeria in 2004
Algiers doesn't look the same
Why don't we drop it?
I'm not wearing any shoes
Yanni's father is Muslim
I'm not with Tom
Yanni's parents are Muslim
Yanni doesn't even know why
I'm wearing a hijab
How do I look?
Mom, what are you wearing?
It's a hijab
How do I look?
Yanni didn't talk to me
He's doing it for God
Probably dozens.
Is the Quran the word of God?
Yanni isn't Muslim
I'm not a girl
Give the girl a toy, Tom
That'll show Tom
It's too loud in the hospital
This game isn't in stock
I don't know anyone in Rome
That's a nice-looking house
Why don't we head out?
How will you go home today?
Why don't we go away?
Tom knows he's wrong
How will you get home today?
Why don't we all do it?
Tom isn't the man he once was
Up yours!
Why don't we try to find Tom?
I won't cover up for Tom
Why do you point at Tom?
Don't look, mum
Why don't we leave?
Is Tom going out?
What kinds of sport do you do?
In town, the shops were closed
Why don't we go to a movie?
He can't tell green from blue
She will have a few days' rest
Finding water here wasn't easy
What will he be talking about?
Please don't drink this water

There isn't enough fresh water
Where's your girlfriend from?
She's Russian.
I won't leave until tomorrow

Do you plan to leave tomorrow?
How about a quarter to one?
Let's play hooky
Let's skip school
You're breaking up
I can't hear you
Bring a sheet of paper, please
I can't hear you
Why don't we study?
There wasn't a cloud in sight
Do you want some more wine?
Do you want some more coffee?
There isn't any more cheese
Tom didn't make a mistake
Whose car did you borrow?
Steep for about 5 minutes
Why don't we ditch Tom?
One bagel, please
Why don't we get Tom to do it?
Nevermind!
It's nothing!
No matter!
Do you ever drive to school?
Why don't we ask Tom to leave?
When I see blood, I feel ill
Has Tom been here?
Don't eat yellow snow
I wish you'd take this
I wish that you'd take this
Where can we put our bags?
Why don't we do that for Tom?
How long may I stay here?
Why don't we congratulate Tom?
It's time for my nap
Why don't we all help Tom?
No one knows he's still alive
Why don't we offer it to Tom?
Is the zoo far from here?
Why don't we go find Tom?
Why don't we sell this to Tom?
Mary doesn't use lipstick
Do you mind waiting here?
Would you mind waiting here?
What are the kids afraid of?
Yanni's phone was dead
Yanni's charger isn't working
Yanni's phone died again
That's how the crash happened
Yanni didn't panic
Is Yanni OK?
Yanni's mom was in Algeria
It needs to be done.
Just save me!
Yanni didn't sneeze
Can Yanni drive again?
Can Yanni walk again?
Can Yanni swim again?
Yanni rubbed Skura's feet
Yanni massaged Skura's legs
Yanni isn't going to be there
Yanni misses Skura's cooking
Yanni is glad he's still alive
Yanni can't be a perfect man
Don't buy cheap light bulbs
Don't touch it
Ouch!
Are these light bulbs good?
Are LED light bulbs recycled?
Who bought these light bulbs?
Are you US citizens?
You've never been to the US
Where is Italy?
Italy isn't an island
He's returning to Italy
How are light bulbs recycled?
We'll be expecting you at 2:30
How old is this temple?
Come on, let's go for a walk
Whose table is this?
Why don't we pay Tom a visit?
Tom's face was pallid
I didn't bring any earmuffs
You're in the wrong forum
I didn't have any change
Why don't we help Tom do this?
Do you like wearing hats?
Why don't we let Tom do it?
Will you be at home tomorrow?
Why don't we give Tom a hand?
Dates are nature's candy
Are these rutabagas?
That doesn't seem enough
You're not the person you were
He's really nice now
I'm hallucinating people
It's really not that important
It seems there's no one in
Why don't we go back home?
Don't press your heels down
I live in my brother's house
Why don't we let Tom win?
It's just pizza
If you want, you can stay here
Why don't we have Tom leave?
The boy didn't change his mind
What a cute boy!
He's a sensitive boy
Let's try a new approach
He's wearing a jacket
I didn't order any rutabagas
Capitalist, eh?
When do we return?
I'm not in the mood for beer
I'm not scared of dogs anymore
Why don't we try calling Tom?
She didn't leave too long ago
Why don't we go to Tom's?
What did Tom say?
I don't know
I don't speak Tom.
Am I a cat?
Let's play house
What about me?
Tom, why don't you be...a cat?
I'm a cat?
We don't make any promises
We're art students
Hey, what's wrong with you?!
Tom knows that he's wrong
We're troubled
Why don't we let Tom leave?
How did he do that?
I brought that for you!
I hope you like it!
Do you eat pizza?
Are you eating pizza?
Why don't we call Tom now?
He deceived me!
Did he send you the money?
How did you even end up there?
Can you take tomorrow off?
Why don't we talk to Tom?
It's been very cold recently
I don't even trust myself
I'm hopeless
Why don't we start with Tom?
Let's finish on a hopeful note
Why don't we help Tom do it?
I didn't visit Boston
Why don't we all go to Tom's?
Jay-walking is dangerous
He wouldn't switch to that job
Won't you turn on the light?
Did you have a good walk?
I'll print it quickly
Why don't we do that with Tom?
Who called?
Wrong number.
You're not bothering me
Are you going out anywhere?
Is she going out tomorrow?
This window won't shut
Is your office far from here?
We're different people now
I'm going to go eat something
I've got you covered
I'm a crazy cat lover
Why don't we leave Tom alone?
Please pass me the salt?
Whose horse is this?
I got you.
No, I can't
You can't justify what you did
Is this your turtle?
My left arm isn't so strong
I'm cold
Hands off my work!
We're unafraid
The sun hasn't come out today
This is my sister's
Tom, your mom's here
No, I still don't know
That must've hurt a lot.
Shut up and keep working!
No one knows I'm here
I can't tell my father
She's scared that you get lost
I'm going to buy a juice
Maybe we shouldn't go there
Someone's on the road
Stop the car!
I'm not touching anything
This money isn't mine anymore
I don't want you to return it
Crying won't get us anywhere
What a strange world!
What a weird world!
We'll have to amputate.
Don't think you saved my life
Why don't we help Tom do that?
Am I laughing?
I know I'm missing something
I just don't know what
Why don't we give Tom a ride?
Why don't we forget about Tom?
Why don't we ask Tom to do it?
This must be annoying!
Why don't we get Tom to leave?
Tom isn't are polite as Mary
I've missed you too, Tom
Tom gets up at six o'clock
Why don't we try to help Tom?

The train's coming
I'll take the elevator
I'm going to take the elevator
I'm going to go take a stroll
Are you coming with me?
It'll be a hot day
I'll be very brief
There isn't any coffee left
Why's that dog growling?
What do you have in your sack?
She didn't let me do it
Why don't we do it for Tom?
The light switch doesn't work
Why is this light switch hot?
Do you have enough wire?
What color are the wires?
The wire won't come out
Don't worry about those wires
It's not worth taking the risk
Let's turn the power back on
Are these light switches good?
How does electricity work?
Can you see the light switch?
Not again!
Again?
Yes.
God help me.
Yanni doesn't see the wire
Don't touch that bare wire
It's time to turn on the power
How is it going over there?
How is it going over there?
It's going really well.
What do you think?
This is amazing?
We're all law-abiding citizens
Why don't we write Tom a note?
Tom's on the way
Tom's a clown
That's not entirely surprising
That's not a total surprise
It's not a complete surprise
Tom's a little nervous
Is there uranium in Iran?
Why don't I know about it?
Mary, you're the sweeper
I'm the dishwasher
Hey there, good friends!
A windshield is laminated.
What do you mean?
It's layered.
Ah, OK.
Why don't we do it Tom's way?
Do you often wear a hat?
Oh, my goodness
It's all scratched up
What do you mean?
Can't you see?
It's all scratched up.
Why don't we have Tom do that?
It's been cool recently
Why don't we let Tom do that?
It's very unlikely to happen
They've messed it up
Is she really shy?
Why don't we go tell Tom?
How's she?
How's she doing?
How is she?
Where did the car stop?
We're well off
Why don't we have Tom do this?
Do you like hot dogs?
I'm Macedonian
Where is his father?
Where are you?
In the garden.
Where's your husband?
In my jacket pocket.
Where are the passports?
Where's her hat?
Where else?
Why don't we go over to Tom's?
We're ambulance drivers
Where did you find this?
In the mailbox.
And where did she hear that?
Where do you buy groceries?
Where did they learn Slovak?
He's somewhere nearby

Where do you cross the road?

Do you know how to play poker?
Rain won't keep us from going
You can't get there by plane
I'm the night shift nurse
I've made a lot of new friends
I think I'm determined
Let's go swimming after school
I'm worth it
Take a wild guess.
I don't care about sports
Why don't we go with Tom?
I'd like you to drive me home
Why don't we go and find Tom?
If you know it, you know it
Do you have kids?
Yes, I have a son.
Does Tom have classes today?
Tom doesn't have classes today
Why don't we go check on Tom?
What kind of hat do you want?
Let's go a bit slower
Is Boston as hot as Chicago?
Tom hasn't cut the meat yet
Where is Tom studying?
There's a cat on the porch
Do you like watching TV?
Twelve apples!
What's this tool called?
I can't hear you, Gabriel
Why don't we give Tom a lift?
Yanni's car is outside
This isn't Yanni's car.
How do you know?
When does the meeting start?
Don't ask how I know that
Don't ask how I know that
Girls love that.
How do you know that?
I'm a girl.
It's so tiny
Yanni.
Whay?
The windshield.
What's wrong with it?
No shit!
Why don't we go visit Tom?
Yanni fixed it.
It's barely noticeable
Sure.

I'm a scaly, not a furry
Here's a picture of my school
Why don't we get takeout?
Why don't we use this one?
I'm here, my friends
Why don't we look into it?
Was Tom involved in it too?
Why don't we get married?
I'm also from Russia
Do you live in Russia?
Why don't we drive to Boston?
She's dressed beautifully
I'm thirsty
Do you have any beer?
What time's her flight?
I'll leave the books here
Why don't we get to it?
Bad for the losers.
He's got no idea about anatomy
It's pure chance
It's pure coincidence
She's never late for school
Happy Bicycle Day!
Where will it lead?
Football is the people's game
Why don't we go there soon?
Why don't we eat lunch?
Are there any parks nearby?
Did you burn yourself?
How did you burn yourself?
It won't stay that way
It won't stay this way
Don't cut down these trees
It seems there's nobody in
It seems there's nobody home
It seems there's no one home
We don't sell draft beer
That's the reason I'm late

She's going alone
Is he blackmailing you?
Why don't we share a taxi?
Yanni's windshield is cracked
Why don't we play soccer?
Why don't we try that again?
There wasn't a second to lose
Why don't we go on Monday?
We're here for that.
Thank goodness.
Let's see how it looks
Why don't we go to the mall?
I don't like gray skies
Why don't we go?
Wasn't Tom home?
We've done OK
Why don't we go right away?
I really hope we don't lose
Why don't we improvise?
I asked her if she's well
This is not my business!
You're the one responsible
Why don't we practice?
Unfortunately, I am right
Why do you have to die?
Did something burn?
I'm drawing
Is she your niece?
Does Tom have WhatsApp?
He's drawing an apple
He's not bad at drawing
She's not bad at drawing
Who is the girl who is crying?
Who is the girl who's crying?
Who's the girl who's crying?
Who's the girl who is crying?
Why don't we open the window?
He's afraid of him
That's democracy
Wow!
What's that?
Let me lead you!
The kid's learning to talk
She's made some biscuits
She's been baking biscuits
She's been making biscuits
Do you speak Korean?
Excuse me!
It's not far
A story featuring a squirrel.
And did he like eating nuts?
Does she have brothers?
And I'm the Queen of Sheba
Out!
Now!
Why don't we remain calm?
It wasn't just rain
Stop spitting!
Hold your breath!
What does the clock say?
He's walking the path
He's walking along the path
Marcus says he's bored
These clothes are 100% wool
For some time, he said nothing
Mum's cooking in the kitchen
The rain continued for 40 days
Enough now, Tom
They haven't eaten anything
Is she sleeping at the moment?
She's phoned
She's rung
Is there a toilet here?
They've both come
Why don't we play dodgeball?
Tom's hair is gray
It's very humdrum
It's very ordinary
Mary didn't accept the gifts
This jacket's got buttons
It's supposed to be a party
Why don't we meet in Boston?
Why don't we get on with it?
Tom fed Mary's dog
It's the twentieth of April
Tom isn't French
Tom isn't Australian
Tom's not Australian
Tom's not Jewish
Why don't we drink some wine?
Tom is dirt-poor
We'll install spotlights
Let's install some spotlights
Let's install a burglar alarm
Why don't we go over there?
Tom's cover was blown
I blew Tom's cover
This isn't what I paid for
Why don't we wait till 2:30?
Why don't we go this way?
I've lost my patience with you
Why don't we go for it?
In what year?
Yanni's windshield is dusty
Yanni's windshield is wet
It's nice and hard
95 years old!
God Save the Queen!
Why don't we give it a shot?
There's a mirror on every wall
You aren't afraid
I'll show you the exit
They didn't tell me that
Really?
Where?
It's right here.
It's gone
Yanni isn't expecting miracles
Why don't we go back now?
Why don't we park over there?
Tom is cool, too
Why don't we step inside?
I don't eat salmon anymore
Why don't we peek inside?
The cat's purring in my lap
Why don't we start right now?
Why don't we attack?
You're screwed
Tom won't stop talking
Hey you, come here!
Why don't we go find out?
Tom has Mary's backpack
Why don't we go have lunch?
Why are ducklings yellow?
I'm Jewish
Why don't we go kayaking?
I don't live there
Why don't we give it a try?
Why don't we do that tonight?
Why would I be angry?
Why don't we go to the river?
Let's fuck
Why don't we get in the car?
What a beautiful star!
First time?
Why don't we go today?
Are there any doctors here?
Don't eat so much bread
Are you Canadian citizens?
Tom didn't panic
Why don't we give up?
Why don't we eat out?
Let's start when he comes home
I'm playing football
I'd like a pint
They'll miss the train
He'll miss the train
Why don't we build something?
I need to stay here until 2:30
Have you read the magazine?
I've flicked through it a bit.
Where's my cactus?
It's on the windows sill.
Why don't we go somewhere?
This is King Street.
You're standing in it.
It's too warm in the infirmary
It's too warm in the sickroom
Now who are you ringing?
Who are you ringing now?
Tom said he'd like to do that
Why don't we change places?
I know that I'll see you again
You're in luck this time
Why don't we share a cab?
Has she slept?
Did she sleep?
Go!
We're just here to have fun
Why don't we go drinking?
I know.
It's tough being a mom.
Ask me.
The game is over.
Says who?
Says me.
The game is over.
Says you!
I'll win.
In your dreams.

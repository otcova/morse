I'm starting the countdown
What should I have for lunch?
What should I have for dinner?
What should I drink?
So how was it?
Yeah, you are
I promise you, that's not cool
That's totally not cool
I bet it'd look great on me.
Ew, no!
You could get me sick!
I think we shouldn't use this
Tom won't say anything
I can't help you right now
I'm busy
I didn't even open the book
You're needed in the warehouse
Don't touch them
Don't move them
Are you free on Mondays?
I'm the same height as you are
Call me if you can't come
How did you bruise your knee?
How did your knee get bruised?
Not at all.

It's €35 all told
Tom's interests are diverse
He's rich and younger than me
How many children do you have?
Russia liberated Europe, too.
A little more than 400,000.

She didn't notice anything
He didn't notice a thing
Sit there, please

Don't scale back your ambition
Do you have career ambitions?
It's easy to use this material
Is it OK to you?
You're the problem here

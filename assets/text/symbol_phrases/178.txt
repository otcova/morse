We have to stop at Tom's
We have to be sure we're right
We have to do what's right
We have to get Tom's keys
We have work to do, remember?
I hope your day was great!
We close at 2:30
We know it's you
We haven't been on a date yet
We haven't found anything yet
We haven't questioned Tom yet
We haven't found the gun yet
We haven't been invited yet
We haven't even seen it yet
We haven't gotten to it yet
We haven't won anything yet
We haven't tried that yet
We haven't started yet
We haven't begun yet
We aren't dead yet
We haven't finished our work
We found a copy of Tom's will
We don't know how or why
We haven't seen Tom in a while
We aren't leaving for a while
We didn't get caught, did we?
We did have fun, didn't we?
We do that a lot, don't we?
We'd better get out of the way
We can't go back that way
We can't risk waiting
We don't have long to wait
We don't have time to wait
We know you're a vegetarian
We shouldn't let that stop us
We'd like you to come with us
We didn't bring it with us
We knew you'd be upset
We'd better wake Tom up
We found Tom's umbrella
We both know that isn't true
We both know that's not true
We can use Tom's truck
We haven't even tried
We miss you, too
We know you can handle it, Tom
We don't need to talk to Tom
We know you're in there, Tom
We weren't able to reach Tom
We know you didn't kill Tom
We shouldn't do this to Tom
We didn't mean to hurt Tom
We'd better go pick up Tom
We haven't heard from Tom
We don't really need Tom
We can't just leave Tom
We'd better go find Tom
We'd better go help Tom
We haven't seen Tom
We can't trust Tom
We can't stop Tom
We hear you, Tom
We shouldn't be seen together
We shouldn't be together
We'd be great together
We haven't got a lot of time
We just don't have the time
We don't have a long time
We weren't prepared for this
We can't function like this
We don't know who did this
We shouldn't be doing this
We shouldn't do this
We can't fight this
We can't do this
We both know what's out there
We didn't know you were there
We know you're still there
We can't get in there
We can't go in there
We know you're there
We didn't have money for that
We didn't need Tom for that
We know it's not about that
We weren't involved in that
We don't have to read that
We can't just ignore that
We can't let them do that
We could've done that
Are we clear on that?
We can't afford that
We shouldn't do that
We couldn't do that
We can't risk that
We'd like to run some tests
We think we'll be successful
We'd better get started
We'd better find it soon
We all know you're smart
We shouldn't take the risk
We both know this isn't right
We think you're right
We believe it's possible
We'd better get in position
We can't come to the party
We'd better check it out
We didn't exactly hit it off
We don't have a choice now
We don't have it right now
We can't go into that now
We can't do this now
We can't leave now
We've been waiting all morning
We couldn't help Tom any more
We'd better take a look
We weren't gone that long
We can't wait that long
We haven't got long
We don't have long
We'd like to see a wine list
We don't have any gas left
We've got three days left
We couldn't stop laughing
We're running a little late
We both know it's too late
We found Tom's keys
We'd better go check on it
We can't get enough of it
We don't need to see it
We couldn't afford it
We just can't find it
We couldn't find it
We couldn't risk it
We couldn't stop it
We can't afford it
We can't forget it
We can't prove it
We can't burn it
We can't stop it
We can't take it
We don't know where Tom is
We don't know what it is
We haven't been introduced
We didn't hear you come in
We'd better go back in
We think it's a good idea
We'd better leave the car here
We can't just leave them here
We can't just leave it here
We'd better get out of here
We both know why I'm here
We can't leave Tom here
We know you're in here
We could've called for help
We haven't made much headway
We don't mean you any harm
We shouldn't have made Tom go
We've still got a ways to go
We can't just let Tom go
We couldn't stop giggling
We know you're Tom's friend
We could've made a fortune
We hoped you'd forget
We know who we're looking for
We're just about finished
We didn't even get that far
We couldn't go out either
We can't do that either
We know what you're doing
We haven't had our dinner
We knew you'd come
We didn't click
We couldn't have children
We'd still have a chance
We've tried this before
We could've fought back
We can't make any assumptions
We'd better do what they ask
We don't know where we are
We couldn't find it anywhere
We aren't getting anywhere
We haven't agreed to anything
We haven't touched anything
We haven't done anything
We can't prove anything
We all know that you're angry
We'd better move along
Are we in trouble again?
I'm a child
He's eating
He's not eating
I don't have anything to throw
I don't have anyone to yell at
I'm pretty busy right now
I'm not as busy as Tom is
I've had a very busy morning
I've been very busy this week
I've been busy today
I've been busy this week
I've been busy lately
I've been busy all week
Do you play with my shoes?
I'm reading a book
You're at home
He's at home
She's at home
They're at home
Mondays aren't good for me
It's a very small town
Tom's room is quite small
I'm not good at small talk
You're lucky you're so small
It's smaller than I remember
Do I need a screwdriver?
Is this a screwdriver?
Where is the screwdriver?
It's a family tradition
How big of an idiot are you?
Is this big enough for you?
How big an idiot are you?
I'm not a big letter writer
It's a big world
There's a big storm on way
I'm not a big TV watcher
It's a big universe
Tom thinks he's in big trouble
You've got a big day tomorrow
You're taking a big risk, Tom
What's the big deal with Tom?
It's a big country, Tom
We've got a big job today
What's the big deal?
It's not a big thing
It's no big thing
It's much bigger than that
How big is the team?
Well, that's a big surprise
What's the big surprise?
It's a big step
That's a pretty big snake
How big was your school?
How big is your school?
Is there a big rush?
It's a big room
It's still a big risk
It was no big deal, really
I'm getting a big raise
You've got a big problem
Do you have any bigger ones?
Can we get a bigger one?
It'll be a big occasion
Don't cry
You're a big boy now
Tom's in the big leagues now
So what's the big hurry now?
You're in big trouble now
Does Tom have a big nose?
What's the big news?
So what's the big mystery?
What's the big mystery?
Tom's got a really big mouth
You've got a big mouth
Tom's got a big mouth
That's kind of a big mistake
We're making a big mistake
You've made a big mistake
They're not big fans of mine
It's a really big night for me
Tom's a lot bigger than me
It's a big deal to me
Tom's a big liar
It's no big deal, you know
It's all a big joke
It's an awfully big job
That's a big job
It's big, isn't it?
Hey what's the big idea?
Why the big hurry?
It's a big hospital
Tom is quite big-headed
Tom's very big-headed
Tom is big-headed
Tom's big-headed
Where's the big guy?
I'm against big government
You're taking a big gamble
Tom wasn't that big a fool
Does Tom have big feet?
Could I ask you a big favor?
Can you do me a big favor?
I'm your biggest fan
How big was your donation?
It's a big decision
Is it really that big a deal?
This shouldn't be a big deal
It can't be that big a deal
It's really not a big deal
It wasn't that big a deal
That's kind of a big deal
Tom said it's no big deal
It's not that big a deal
It's really a big deal
So what's the big deal?
Yeah, it's no big deal
This isn't a big deal
It wasn't a big deal
It's a very big deal
Is that a big deal?
Is this a big deal?
That's no big deal
It's a big deal
When's the big day?
Tom's a big coward
How big was your contribution?
It's a pretty big club
It's a big city
You made a big mistake, buddy
Do you have a bigger bowl?
Do you think this is too big?
You're getting so big
It's way too big
Is this too big?
What's the big attraction?
What's the big deal anyway?
What was the big announcement?
Can we make a substitution?
I'm going to school
She's going to the hospital
What would you like to order?
What a bunch of assclowns!
Tom, I'm in the basement
Let's organize a search party
I'm a compulsive scribbler
You're a compulsive scribbler
Happy Father's Day!
Tom's essay had many typos
And what is the problem?
What music do you like?
What are yellow cards?
Do they give you points?
Come on, Tom
Let's go
It's part of the game
It's a red card!
Oooh, somebody's in trouble!
I didn't know how to respond
I couldn't stop
Sure, why not
Why don't you come, too?
Do you have a cough?
I am a part-time photographer
I'm sicker than I thought
Tom's really bad
Tom's pulse is weak
Tom's pulse is very weak
Tom's pulse is strong
Tom's pulse is still strong
Tom's pulse is slow
Tom's pulse is racing
Tom's pulse is normal
Tom's pulse is low
Tom's pulse is fast
The nurse checked Tom's pulse
I couldn't find a pulse
Check Tom's pulse
Check Tom's pulse again
Tom peed on me!
Hello, everybody!
We're here to entertain you
Make it quick, will you?
I haven't got all day
What are you doing here, Tom?
What are you doing here, Tom?
You were thinking about Tom.
I was not!
I was thinking about work.
Thank you, Tom
Oh!
Thank you, my dear
Did anyone follow you?
Didn't anybody follow you?
Did anybody follow you?
Do you think he did it?
Do you think she did it?
Who do you think did it?
We're done for today
I know you don't like him
I know you don't like her
I know you don't like them
I know you don't like Mary
I didn't know you were a poet
He even wrote me poems.
Love poems?
Thanks a lot, mom!
You just ruined my life!

We're coming back tomorrow
We're going ahead with this
What are my orders?
What are you snickering about?
Why are you getting upset?
Do you drink whiskey?
Where'd you get to last night?

I hate everything!

It's a scutigera
Are you alright?
We're both named Tom
We're both named Mary
I've lost a filling
I'm going to shut up now
Okay, I'm going to shut up now
I know you're in love with me
What is this right here?
What was his reaction?
What was her reaction?
Was the movie interesting?
Nobody's allowed in there
Tom says I'm not dependable
Would you mind if I wait here?
Would you mind if I join you?
Would you mind if I help?
Who else is here?
Who else is there with you?
Who else was at the meeting?
Whose pile of junk is this?
Whose stuff is this?
Do you know Murphy's law?
I didn't catch the sentence
Is Tom back yet?
Is Tom any good at baseball?
Did Tom push you?
Did Tom look OK?
Did Tom find it?
To me, it's important
That's important to me
What a rip off!
You can't do it
Why am I going?
Why am I alive?
Who called 911?
What do I know?
What did I get?
What can I use?
Were you angry?
What did I win?
It's a good day for a picnic
It's what I do
It's my day off
Where do I sign?
What fell on me?
Which leg hurts?
There's no need to rush

That's part of the fun
You've had your fun
I've never even touched a gun
I don't wear a gun
Tom's personal life is his own
You're bringing me down
Tom isn't about to back down
Tom wouldn't back down
We're trying to track Tom down
That's how it went down
I'm putting my foot down
I'm going to put my foot down
We're the talk of the town
It's what I'd do
There's something we could do
It's not what we do
I think that'll do
I guess that'll do
I'll tell you what I can do
It's the only thing Tom can do
I didn't care what I had to do
It'll have to do
That's what Tom likes to do
That'll never do
That's what I always do
I'm going to give it a go
I never should've let Tom go
We're good to go
I assume we're free to go
Look, I have to go
There's nowhere for Tom to go
You're clear to go
The party's over
You've got to go
That's not the way to go
OK, people, let's go
We're letting you go
That's why we let you go
I couldn't just let you go
Remember, Tom, just say no
Tom didn't exactly say no
Tom is probably dead, too
Tom laughed, too
Get me a slice of pie, too
I know you care about me, too
I'm under suspicion, too
That's what I want, too
You're authorized to do so
It's not nice being lied to
It's a lot to get used to
I can't go even if I wanted to
That's a wrap
It'll help you sleep
Tom is lying in bed, asleep
Get lost, you creep
I'm in a relationship
Don't give me any lip
I know it's been a long trip
If they asked, we could help
Tom's too far gone to help
It doesn't help
That's why you're a cop
I'm an undercover cop
Tom's car screeched to a stop
When's this going to stop
I'm not about to stop
You're all washed up
I'm washed up
Tom just doesn't measure up
I didn't open anything up
I'll screw everything up
We're not splitting up
I know you're making it all up
OK people, listen up
Wow, you've really grown up
We can't keep this up
I didn't make those answers up
We're three floors up
I think you've been set up
Somebody must've picked it up
I don't think Tom made it up
That's why I brought it up
It's not safe to split up
I'm not trying to pick you up
Maybe this'll cheer you up
They'll cheer you up
They'll put you up
That's where I grew up
It's time you grew up
I think I'm going to throw up
I'm going to need some backup
You don't even have a car
Tom can't buy himself a car
That's what I like to hear
I know you're near
I didn't mean it, I swear
Tom couldn't have gotten far
You don't have to go that far
I didn't make it very far
There isn't going to be a war
We're in the middle of a war
That's what I remember
I'll tell you what I remember
It's hard to remember
Hey, I should get your number
Tom isn't a charismatic leader
You're not exactly an outsider
I could've been a contender
It's getting harder
It's a special order
We're awaiting your order
We're investigating a murder
It'd be murder
Tom isn't guilty of murder
It's getting louder
I couldn't be prouder
You're the engineer
It'd be safer to do it my way
Tom's life's in danger
We're in no danger
You're in great danger
There's great danger
Tom wasn't a perfect stranger
I'm only the messenger
Tom can't take it any longer
They don't exist any longer
It's getting stronger
I've never felt stronger
Let's get to it
I'm not getting any younger
Tom isn't fit to be a teacher
We're birds of a feather
Tom wasn't much of a father
We'll all die together
We'll solve this together
It'll keep us together
We'll solve it together
This one's not working either
I can't see you either
That's why we like each other
I can't bother
Tom was a soldier's soldier
I'm not a stalker
I'm an excellent listener
This one's a no-brainer
That's quite a shiner
I'll see you at dinner
I guess I'll see you at dinner
I don't need a partner
I've never seen so much paper
I've canceled the fundraiser
It'll make sense later
I'll try to pop in later
You're not the one we're after
You're the writer
Tom's pulse beat faster
Well, I've had better
You've looked better
The less delay, the better
Well, I've been better
I'm sure it will get better
I've never slept better
I don't need a computer
It's only a computer
You can't protect Tom forever
I haven't seen you in forever
We can't live together forever
You're the driver
It'll never be over
We'll have a sleep over
Thank goodness that's over
Tom is glad it's over
I'm going to hit the shower
You're a real team player
Tom hasn't got a prayer
That's why I need a lawyer
I don't think it would be fair
I've got sand in my hair
Your table is ready, sir
Tom didn't stir
I'll get what I came for
I'm not worth dying for
I don't need a counselor
I can feel Tom's terror
You're one savvy negotiator
You've got one hour
The choice was Tom's
That's not how it was
That's just how it was
They'll find us jobs
There's a price on our heads
I don't have any job leads
My whole life's in your hands
Tom's life is in your hands
We're not here to make friends
I'm just talking to my friends
It'll just take three seconds
Tom isn't in the best of moods
You should've seen their faces
Tom couldn't take any chances
They've been gone ages
I've got to check my messages
I'm not going to press charges
I'm waiting tables
You're losing your marbles
I don't like needles
Tom isn't playing by the rules
I'm not in the mood for games
Let's see what it does
I didn't spit on your shoes
It's not like anybody cares
Tom, hold your horses
I'm done making excuses
It'll just take three minutes
You're digging your own graves
We're here to save lives
Let's not lie to ourselves
I'm not that good at goodbyes
I've been waiting in the wings
I've been where Tom is
I'm afraid to ask what that is
I'm just telling you how it is
Look, I need this
Nobody could've planned this
I couldn't have planned this
Wait'll you see this
They won't all be like this
It's like this
I don't like you like this
I'm not usually like this
Tom would've never done this
I don't wish to debate this
Tom doesn't deserve this
I don't like the look of this
I'm so sorry about all of this
I'm watching this
You're the one doing this
I'm using this
They're having fun with this
You can't get away with this
You'll hardly feel this
I'll never remember all this
Wow, look at all this
I can't walk away from this
I can't be involved in this
We're together in this
You don't get a say in this
I'm not sure I can win this
Tom hadn't counted on this
Let's be clear on this
You're going to do this
Look, I can't do this
Let's just do this
You can't just do this
There's nothing to this
I won't be pushed into this
I won't get sucked into this
I won't drag Tom into this
I didn't look for this
Hey, I didn't sign on for this
You're really amazing at this
You've been warned about this
Tell me you're sure about this
I'm scared to death about this
I'm really fired up about this
I'm so sorry about this
That's why I got you this
I never thought I'd say this
I can't be distracted by this
That's on a need-to-know basis
You wouldn't last three weeks
Tom hasn't been seen in weeks
It's only for a few weeks
Tom has at least 300 books
We're spinning our wheels
You're as tough as nails
I won't go into details
Tom wouldn't pay his bills
That's the way it seems
I'm having some legal problems
Let's not argue about that now
We've got bigger problems
They're in separate rooms
Tom is asleep in Mary's arms
They'll know what that means
I'm still studying the plans
I don't care about Tom's plans
I've got varicose veins
I've had my suspicions
Don't make any rash decisions
I've severed communications
We'd better make preparations
I don't respond to accusations
We're not taking questions
We're playing for keeps
I've always been into cars
Tom couldn't stop the tears
I don't have a hundred dollars
I've gone over the numbers
I'm under orders
It's not like we're strangers
I can't talk to strangers
I don't pick up hitchhikers
It's just good manners
We aren't the murderers
I'll take you to your quarters
I'm seeking answers
That'd take hours
You've been at this for hours
You've been at it for hours
I'm a huge fan of yours
I'm guessing it's yours
I'm guessing this is yours
I think I'm going to pass
I've got nothing to confess
Tom couldn't care less
It's very rare and priceless
We'll be totally defenseless
I'm sure you feel helpless
I've had enough of this mess
It's a legitimate business
You're an unreliable witness
I'm impressed by your progress
That's your guess
It's never just a kiss
It's not something I can miss
Tom must've been suspicious
I don't have to make threats
I don't care about boats
You've got to face the facts
It doesn't change the facts
You're not wearing any pants
They're all in cahoots
I can't afford any more tests
I don't need to run any tests
You're frightening the guests
Someone's been here before us
They're here to save us
You're way ahead of us
We know you're one of us
You could've been one of us
They're almost on top of us
You'll ride with us
They can't kill us
They've turned on us
They're gaining on us
They're closing in on us
They'll come to us
They're coming after us
It's a special time for us
They'll come for us
No one's getting past us
This isn't about Tom
This isn't about us
You're extremely ingenious
You think we're serious
They're kind of serious
Look, I'm serious
It's deadly serious
You're so very serious
That'd be dangerous
It's becoming too dangerous
It's far too dangerous
It's way too dangerous
It's just way too dangerous
It's said to be very dangerous
I think that's really generous
It's a little presumptuous
Listen, I got some bad news
It's bad news
That can't be the good news
I don't know how Tom knows
I'll have it in a couple days
You're out of vacation days
I'm not a deadbeat
That'd be great
That must've felt so great
I hope you've found a seat
I never would've guessed that
It can't be that
I'm sorry you had to see that
We aren't like that
They aren't like that
That's enough of that
I don't like the look of that
I'm not too certain of that
I'm watching that
I don't see Tom doing that
I don't see anybody doing that
I'm not just saying that
You can't go public with that
I'm not concerned with that
I'm comfortable with that
I can't compete with that
It's a little more than that
It's a lot more than that
You're better than that
I couldn't let you do that
It's not going to come to that
I'm so sad to hear that
You didn't need to hear that
There's no getting over that
You're too late for that
You can't lock me up for that
You can't look at that
Let's see about that
We're very curious about that
I'll worry about that
Look, I know that
Let's get back to the boat
We're forever in your debt
Let's stay in close contact
That'd be perfect
That's actually perfect
I've failed in every respect
I'm not a suspect
I've got cold feet
It's a trip I won't forget
It's dead quiet
It's almost too quiet
I'll take the jacket
Let's see your wallet
That's how we met
Hi, I'm Tom
I don't think we've ever met
You just don't want to get wet
It's too early to tell yet
It hasn't come up yet
Don't tell Tom just yet
I haven't dismissed you yet
I'm not finished with you yet
There's hope for you yet
That's what I don't know yet
You've got one minute left
There's only one torpedo left
I don't have many years left
That's your gift
I'll take the first shift
I'll take first shift
Let's get one thing straight
I've been up 36 hours straight
I'm on your flight
It's a school night
I wasn't even there that night
Let's go on a date tonight
I'm waitressing tonight
I'm done for tonight
I'd love to come by tonight
That's Tom on the right
That's quite all right
Just pray I'm right
I'm going to make this right
I didn't plan on being caught
I don't plan on getting caught
My testimony can't be bought
It's just as I thought
I don't know what I thought
That's a nice thought
OK, hold that thought
That's an ugly thought
Someone else must've opened it
Nobody could've guessed it
You can't have wanted it
I've accepted it
I've already accepted it
I don't think I could stand it
I'm going to find it
I don't know who's behind it
That's how I found it
I don't know how Tom stood it
Tom couldn't face it
I'm so glad you made it
That's the way I see it
You'll never see it
They can't see it
You'll never make it
I suppose Tom didn't make it
Trust me, you'll like it
Don't think I won't like it
I'm sure you won't like it
Tom didn't dislike it
Now you've done it
You can't just have it
I'm beginning to believe it
I don't have to prove it
I'm going to prove it
I didn't say they deserve it
Tom didn't see anything
You don't know the half of it
You'll get the hang of it
Don't think of it
That's only part of it
I don't want any part of it
That's the last of it
This isn't the worst of it
I just can't get out of it
You're not getting it
You don't have to watch it
I'll talk you through it
I'll have to live with it
You'll learn to live with it
I'm going to stick with it
They're having fun with it
I'll run with it
I'm vaguely familiar with it
They're getting away with it
Tom isn't getting away with it
Let's chuck it
That's not why I took it
I'll stake my job on it
I'll stake my life on it
I'm going to put my name on it
Tell them we're working on it
I'll stake my reputation on it
That'd do it
That's how we do it
That's when I'll do it
Tom isn't too old to do it
That's the way to do it
You mean you couldn't do it
Don't think I won't do it
OK, let's just do it
Don't get too used to it
I couldn't swear to it
Let's get to it
I'm saying get over it
They'll get over it
I'm completely over it
There's no need for it
We'll wait here for it
You've just got to go for it
We'll pay you for it
I suppose that's it
That's how Tom does it
They're still going at it
You're going to eat it
I think I'm starting to get it
That's certainly not it
I'm very much against it
I know you're up against it
You've lost it
I'm sure you all read about it
I'm very excited about it
Don't get too relaxed about it
I'm not going to talk about it
Don't you even think about it
I guess that's about it
Don't fret about it
I'll tell you about it
I knew you'd blow it
I don't want to blow it
I'm sure you won't enjoy it
You're welcome to wait
It's going to have to wait
I'm a creature of habit
We're all creatures of habit
It doesn't fit
I don't care about profit
I'm doing the speed limit
They've upped my limit
I'm practically an adult
That's very elegant
That's very distant
I know what's relevant
They must know I'm innocent
I haven't exactly been prudent
It wasn't sufficient
That's real convenient
It's a little inconvenient
They're not all violent
They're in their element
It's a lifetime commitment
It's a serious commitment
It's a lifetime appointment
I wasn't in your apartment
The AC's out in my apartment
Tom's priorities are different
It's been different
This time it's different
That's what makes us different
It doesn't feel any different
Let's be content
It's a black tie event
Tom couldn't paint
That's my whole point
Don't hold back on my account
That's the exact amount
That's as far as I got
It's a little hot
You think you're so hot
You're incredibly hot
You'll get only one shot
It's kind of a long shot
Like I said, you're an idiot
I've been an idiot
I know it's asking a lot
I don't expect a lot
Tom wasn't around a whole lot
I can't imagine why not
Drop your weapon or I'll shoot
It's hard to accept
I know it's hard to accept
I'm not usually this inept
You said I wasn't to interrupt
I'm nursing a broken heart
Just say what's in your heart
I think that's really smart
I think you're plenty smart
That's my favorite part
That's the tough part
That's the hardest part
That's the worst part
That's the scary part
I'm not falling apart
We're worlds apart
That's a good place to start
It's a great place to start
I don't have a favorite shirt
That's a real comfort
We've confirmed the report
It's not like anybody got hurt
That can't last
It's what Tom and I do best
I know it's a lot to digest
Tom, give it a rest
We're placing you under arrest
I'm placing you under arrest
You're the guest
I don't need a psychologist
Tom's eyes were moist
It's hard to resist
I know when I've lost
You're the worst
I'm talked out
I'm caffeined out
I'm tapped out
We're going to find out
It's freaking me out
You're not buying me out
I'll show myself out
I'm not freaking out
Tom says you're moving out
I'm not moving out
You'd just better watch out
I didn't sneak out
Tom's story didn't check out
I just can't figure them out
Tom's girlfriend threw him out
I'm going to check Tom out
I think I'll help Tom out
You're time just ran out
We'll talk this out
Tom must've sold us out
I didn't really think it out
That's what I'm here about
It's all Tom can talk about
There's nothing to think about
It's a lot to think about
I think we'll stay put
I've offended you
That's why I need you
That's why we need you
That's why I hired you
That's why I rescued you
That's why I loved you
That's why I followed you
That's why I came to see you
It's wonderful to see you
I could've been like you
There aren't many men like you
That's so unlike you
I'm not trying to pressure you
I won't let her have you
That's really noble of you
I'm one of you
That's very mature of you
That's very civil of you
We weren't making fun of you
I don't believe the two of you
That's very elitist of you
That's enough out of you
Nobody's forcing you
I don't like Tom touching you
That's why I'm asking you
I won't even touch you
I'm learning Turkmen
That's what's wrong with you
I won't go back with you
I'm choosing to go with you
I haven't been honest with you
Tell us what's new with you
I'm not ashamed to tell you
It'd kill you
Give me that or I'll kill you
Tom won't hesitate to kill you
I don't need a sermon from you
That's what I want from you
I couldn't take money from you
I don't wish to harm you
I didn't intend to alarm you
I don't want to alarm you
I didn't mean to demean you
I'm happier than you
That's why I came to you
Tell me why I'm talking to you
It'll come back to you
I'm very drawn to you
I guess that'll be up to you
I'll make this up to you
I'll have it sent to you
Maybe I'll run into you
It's going to help you
That isn't going to help you
I don't wish to anger you
That can't be good for you
I guess that's good for you
That shouldn't be hard for you
That's gratitude for you
That's why I came for you
They'll be rooting for you
That's why I fell for you
That'd be a good color for you
I've got real feelings for you
That's why I sent for you
They're just for you
I'll make this easy for you
You're not fooling anyone, Tom
We know it's you
I'm sorry if I snapped at you
I'm surprised at you
It's a real honor to meet you
It's a great honor to meet you
They're out to get you
Sometimes I don't get you
I've upset you
I never should've left you
Hey, Tom, glad I caught you
That's why Tom hit you
You'll never know what hit you
That's why we want you
I never would've shot you
We aren't here to hurt you
It can't hurt you
Don't think I won't hurt you
I don't hold that against you
I won't hold it against you
It'll cost you
It's going to cost you
That's why I trust you
I'm not writing about you
I've read all about you
Tom, this isn't about you
That's why I worry about you
We're better off without you
I'm still intimidated by you
We aren't here to destroy you
It's against the law
That's not what I saw
You're missing the late show
I'm surprised Tom didn't show
It's our only show
It's excruciatingly slow
We're as good as dead now
That's all changed now
It's finished now
You can't change your mind now
I'm done fooling around now
It's got to be now
We're on the same page now
You'll come with me now
You're part of the gang now
I'm in the mood to talk now
That's how I feel now
I don't need to see Tom now
I'm going to hang up now
We're all in this together now
I'm hanging in there for now
We'll go with that for now
Let's do this now
The machine's yours now
I'm opening my presents now
It's a bit late for that now
I can't be bothered right now
I just don't care right now
I'm coming up there right now
That's all I know right now
We're in for it now
We're serious about it now
I'm practically an adult now
It's so different now
I'm practically an expert now
I'm very unhappy just now
It's all behind you now
No one's going to save you now
I'm coming to you now
I think that's up to you now
I don't know what I know
I don't know how I know
You'd be the one to know
I guess we'll never know
You don't fool me, you know
You're wiser than you know
Well, tell me what you know
I don't rightly know
I'll be on my feet tomorrow
I'm going to use it tomorrow
We're in the same fix
You haven't aged a day
Somebody's having a good day
I'm having kind of a weird day
I've had a really weird day
We'll get out of here one day
It's your special day
Today's your special day
It's a gorgeous day
It's a great day
It's been a slow day
It's your lucky day
Today's your lucky day
Tom's trial started today
You can't be around today
You're in quite a mood today
You're in a strange mood today
You've taken a big step today
That's plenty for today
I'm going to hit the hay
This is child's play
There's a small price to pay
That's the price you pay
It's just pepper spray
You'll do exactly as I say
That's what you should say
I'll say what I have to say
That's what I'm trying to say
That's kind of you to say
That's nice of you to say
That isn't for you to say
It's as you say
That doesn't mean I can stay
We'll get you a place to stay
Tom didn't care to stay
I can't possibly stay
It's on the way
I've been feeling the same way
You'd feel the same way
I don't mind either way
Tell me you're on your way
Tom was in Mary's way
They're headed this way
It's on its way
You can't talk to me that way
You don't talk to me that way
You'll never escape that way
It doesn't look that way
Hey, it doesn't work that way
You've always been that way
You can't talk to us that way
You can't get out that way
I'm glad they see it my way
They'll take me away
You'll give me away
You'll give yourself away
I know it's hard to walk away
I'm going to scare Tom away
It'll go away
Tom wouldn't go away
Tom just can't stay away
Tom didn't belong here anyway
I'm at your mercy
You're just in time
It'll come in handy
You could've killed somebody
I didn't mean to usurp anybody
That can't be good for anybody
Tom didn't visit anybody
Get up, everybody
I've been watching you study
We're doing this for the money
I know it's a lot of money
I'm not asking for money
Not everything's about money
It'll help you save energy
I'll tell you why
I couldn't tell you why
I couldn't get that lucky
Tom laughed good-naturedly
I'm hearing that a lot lately
I've forgotten Tom completely
That'll never fly
That won't fly
It's getting ugly
It's going to get ugly
I'm still part of this family
Don't take it so personally
Don't take this personally
The sail won't open fully
Tom didn't attempt to reply
You'll enjoy it tremendously
We've got to talk seriously
I don't hate Tom exactly
That's my point exactly
Tom's smile vanished instantly
I'll wait patiently
That's as good a place as any
That's as good a reason as any
That's real funny
Tom was always a mama's boy
Tom couldn't contain his joy
It's time for your therapy
I'm so sleepy
Tom was tired, but not sleepy
Tom wasn't quite happy
Tom wasn't listening to Mary
Tom's last girlfriend was Mary
It's not brain surgery
That's quite a theory
Hey, it's just a story
I'm not buying your story
That's a different story
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry
There wasn't any special hurry
That's good for a first try
You're making this too easy
You're not making this easy
It's a bit flimsy
Like I said, I was busy
I was worried for Tom's safety
You're a big softy
It's a huge responsibility
I'm sensing a lot of hostility
It's a remarkable opportunity
I'm giving you an opportunity
I don't feel that guilty
I'll see you in twenty
Tom's cup was empty
I'm at an office party
I'll throw you a stag party
I'm so thirsty
You're so pretty
I'm reporting for duty
I can tell you're a nice guy
You've got the wrong guy
Please tell me it's crazy
You're the one that went crazy
What's happening here at 2:30?
Where were you on 9/11?
Let me finish, OK?
It scared me, too, OK?
Don't scare me like that, OK?
Let's talk this thing out, OK?
You just have to relax, OK?
Why all the drama?
How do you feel about opera?
Are we getting pizza?
Who picked you for this job?
Aren't you the romantic?
Should I feel bad?
How long has Tom been dead?
How come you're not dead?
Why aren't you dead?
What would we do instead?
How many beers have you had?
How many have you had?
Did that make Tom mad?
Did that make you mad?
Is it time you need?
Is it money you need?
How do you think Tom died?
Is that why they died?
What have I misspelled?
How many men have you killed?
How many have you killed?
How could it have happened?
Where was Tom imprisoned?
How are you connected?
Were you even tempted?
Do you mind if I get started?
How much do you have invested?
Where are you posted?
Are you that stupid?
Where was Tom being held?
Why should we all stand?
What are they going to find?
What is it you have in mind?
Have I lost my mind?
How should I respond?
How do I respond?
How long has Tom been around?
Why are you being weird?
What's the magic word?
Can I say it aloud?
How old could Tom be?
Who are you supposed to be?
What's it going to be?
Which is it going to be?
What did it turn out to be?
How long will that be?
What might that be?
How big will it be?
How lucky can one guy be?

Tom didn't go to the doctor
Could you hug me?
Did anybody else see you?
Have you been there, too?
I didn't request this
This isn't what I requested
Tom doesn't eat pears
Tom doesn't like pears
Perhaps Tom isn't finished yet
It's a pity you can't go
It's a pleasant day today
I want to eat, but not here
Here's to new beginnings
Tom should've listened to them
It's best left untouched
Tom is a fun-loving adventurer
I'm sleepy
Can you tell me a story?
It's a trivial matter
It's a matter of life or death
And what do you care?
Now it's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time now
Tight lines!
Cancel it!
Don't stress
Is Tom at work?
Just don't tell Tom about it
We're hooked on things
I didn't like that about Tom
It's a kind of orange
They're from Bulgaria
It's a very strange letter
Tom couldn't fix the lock
Tom's behavior was impeccable
Bright colors don't suit Tom
Tom isn't sure he wants to go
Where did you buy that tie?
I'll only go if Tom doesn't go
It's a childish act
This decision saved Tom's life
It's a small dog
It's a love song
We aren't foreigners
I didn't see Tom in the park
It's a dictatorship
It's a long way to the village
Interesting, Bartolomeo.
Marvellous, Bartolomeo.
It's bad to steal
Did Tom see us?
I hope not.
Doctor, what's wrong with Tom?
It's almost three
It's all right so far
How did you get Tom to agree?
Tom didn't look tired at all
It's a very pleasant day today
Do you have relatives abroad?
We haven't yet spoken to Tom
Why's Tom still there?
It's a typical Gothic church
Do you want me to follow Tom?
It's a short drive to the park
You'd better ask Tom yourself
Are gas prices going up?
Why are gas prices going down?
Why are gas prices going up?
It's a little cool today
It's a difficult problem
I've talked to Tom about it
What do you want to achieve?
What's the point of this task?
It's a black hole
What did Tom ask for?
I didn't buy Tom anything
I knew that you'd be mad
You're a genius!
What did Tom want from you?
Has the concert started?
Isn't Tom dead?
It's such a honor to me
It's a holiday tomorrow
Tom won't go back there again
Tom doesn't need to see this
Who did Tom invite?
I'm going to defend Tom
How many days was Tom sick?
I'm glad that you like Tom
Can you tell Tom to be quiet?
Next time, I'll send Tom there
Tom, of course, didn't come?
We're glad Tom is helping us
I'll go, too
I'm scared of that
Have you packed everything?
Hopefully, you're right
It's not an easy thing to do
That's what I thought Tom said
We're thirty minutes away
I've seen that face before
That's just the way things are
Maybe you'd better tell Tom
I'll fly to Boston tomorrow
That wasn't a good choice
I'll be away for three weeks
I'll be gone for three weeks
It'll cost thirty dollars
What was on the table?
I've got plenty of good ideas
I want what's on the table
Has Tom finished classes yet?
Were you the one who found it?
Has Tom finished school yet?
Who's your wife?
Is he going to play with them?
We're happy for you
We haven't lost hope
I haven't found anything
Do you think I don't want to?
When will you pay me?
When will I be paid?
When are you going to pay me?
I can't wait to be a grown-up.
Why?
Tom remixed Mary's song
Who wrote you that letter?
Tom's zipper is stuck
Who wrote you this letter?
Is this Tom's son?
We'll do it one more time
We'll do it once more
Could you teach me Swedish?
Do you watch much TV?
There's no orange juice left
The keys aren't on the table
I hope it'll be a mild winter
Don't eat too much candy
Don't eat too many candies
It's been a very hard winter
I'm aware of the consequences
You're the one whining, not me
I'll try to solve the problem
A chill went down Tom's spine
Tom still hasn't been found
They still haven't found Tom
They haven't found Tom yet
Am I going too fast for you?
Tom didn't do well on the exam
You're not making sense
It's a white lie
Should we hire more teachers?
Are you lot awake?
It's a moral question
They're paying by cheque
They're going to pay by cheque
They'll pay by cheque
Must she stay at home today?
Sit yourself down, Tom
I've made a little supper
Sit yourself down, Tom
I've made a bit of supper
Sit yourself down, Tom
I've made some supper
Yes!
Are those eggs free-range?
Has everyone arrived?
He's buying a pair of shoes
Which rooms are free?
Which rooms are vacant?
Sorry, Mary!
Sorry, Mary!
That isn't how I'd say it
What's Algeria's growth goal?
I'm not sure Tom can hear me
Tom's triumph didn't last long
It's a sheer waste of time
And why not?
So, why do you live with Tom?
I'd suggest you take it easy
It's bad weather today
Tom's room looks like a pigsty
How much does Algeria export?
It's a very sad tale
Tom's room is a pigsty
Twist of fate, would you say?
You're lying to yourself
It's advisable to go by train
I'll be pissed off
I knew that you'd be furious
They're going to Uzbekistan
Robert, what's a 'conlang'?
It's an artificial language.
Don't let them die out
Who did Tom collaborate with?
Jon, let me guess
It's payday today
Was she following me?
I don't know if she likes me
Could you help us, please?
It's an endangered species
Tom is Mary's fellow
I've gone mad
Tom didn't listen to me
Tom still can't be counted on
No parking!
I don't know how to tell Tom
Let's order a bottle of wine
It's a book
I don't know how to tell him
I don't know how to tell her
I don't know how to tell them
I don't know how to tell you
Towards a better tomorrows!
Our love isn't real!
It's advisable for you to go
She just doesn't listen
Tom's right eyelid twitches
I looked deep into Tom's eyes
We may even see a rainbow!
Go to sleep!
Tom must've gone to the doctor
Did you do that?
No, Tom begged me not to.
I've never seen snow before
Let's stay a little bit longer
Was Tom invited to the party?
Where did you leave Tom?
Will Tom study French with us?
You only think about yourself!
That's so typical of you
She isn't smart
Tom didn't even want it
Are you in a hurry?
Not really.
You're shopping
Are you in a rush?
Not really.
You'll be a grandma soon
You're gonna be a grandma soon
Ok!
He's atheist
Tom's hedgehog had babies
That came out of left-field
Where'd you leave Tom?
He's not smart
She's not smart
It's raining and raining
Is that our only option?
Is that our only choice?
Is this all we can do?
How did you get Tom in there?
We're the lucky ones
Do something!
Like what?
I was struck by Tom's words
We didn't have a lot of fun
Does Tom like reading books?
I didn't ask Tom about that
What did you have for supper?
I'll go on foot
You've got so much in common.
Like what?
That's a good way to put it
The apples aren't ripe yet
Tom's time hasn't come yet
That's one way to put it
Did you find out anything?
Are those Tom's clothes?
Where did Tom leave his keys?
Do you sometimes go abroad?

What is Algeria's GDP?
What is Algeria's growth rate?
What's in that glass?
Wine.
Are there any bigger carrots?
Are there any larger carrots?
Is Algeria's economy growing?
Mary, look!
Give it here!
It's mine!
Why is the town called that?
Why is the city called that?
Tom didn't enjoy the movie
Let's not sit here
He'll be sacked
He's going to be sacked
He's going to get the sack
You've had your hair cut
They've had their hair cut
You'll need to use both hands
What's that got to do with it?

My bicycle's got a flat tyre
My bike's got a flat tyre
Where is he staying?
Where's he staying, then?
So where's he staying?
She's in a really good mood
I haven't got any more records
I haven't got any more vinyl
I don't have any more records
I've lost my cinema ticket
I've only got a few pencils
We didn't have much fun there
I've only got a few pens
That's very rare, though
She couldn't find Mary's house
When is Mothering Sunday?
I was wondering that, as well
I was wondering that, too
Are you free tomorrow as well?
Are you free tomorrow too?
I'll graduate in three years
We're going to leave
I can't read that
Look outside!
Hello Mrs Taylor, how are you?
You don't have to stand up
It's hard to put into words
No one's doing anything
Nobody's doing anything
I'm free at the moment
Do you watch a lot of movies?
Mary helped us, too
Don't be such a cry baby
It wasn't my idea
It was Tom's
I'll go there even if it rains
Tom's behavior angered me
I'll come if I can
Tom's condition remains grave
Do you talk with to neighbors?
I'll buy drinks for you all
Sensing danger, Tom stopped

Let's go to school together
I don't see any use for this
I'll take care of it
It's OK to ask questions

I guess I shouldn't have
Did you look at mine yet?
Can you look at mine?
Oh look, a time-traveler
Tom's heart was full of joy
And you are...?
Hi, I'm Tom.
Hello.
And you are?

What's a meme?
What's this story about?
I'm not going to follow Tom

Can it wait until later?
Mom, thanks for everything
Soon it'll be summer

Everyone's talking about it
Where am I supposed to go?
Tom can't afford an attorney
That's all they are

Don't look through my stuff
I'm leaving the theater
Don't buy it again
There's no one behind me
I'm the last one
I'll leave it to your judgment

Which team lost?
That's all we need right now
Right now, I need your help

Did you see what time it was?
I'll make up for it next time
That wasn't very polite

Never ask her age!
Listen carefully!
I don't deal with idiots
How was your summer in Boston?
I'd met him somewhere before
What does Tom want to plant?
Would you say you're creative?
It was probably Berber.
Pardon me?
You're disoriented
Did you weigh yourself today?
Yanni's dog was with him
Yanni.
What?
I don't need time to think
Yanni poisoned Skura's dog
What did you study in Boston?
You're distorting my words
I'll look after the dog
Did we really need to do this?
It' was Berber.
Come again?
Yanni speaks Berber.
What play did you see?
At what time does it open?

That's not something we need
Nothing's holding me back now
Let's wait until night
This is blasphemy!
Tom wasn't made for this world
I won't go fishing with Tom
You'll like Australia
He's highly educated
Tom didn't give us a choice
I don't need men
What's this fun about?
You didn't listen to me again
Yes, you can place it there.
Yes, you can place it there
What are you looking for?
A book!
Does that drink have alcohol?
What is actually culture?
I'll have to work on Monday
Let's maintain decorum
We have only 250 hours left
Should I make you a coffee?
Is the color white or grey?
Now, all we need is volunteers
We don't have any ice
I'll help you, of course
Tom hasn't made a decision yet
Plain-speaking is not my forte
Tom's interest quickly waned
Can I really risk it?
Can I really take the risk?
Is Boston as cold as Chicago?
Where are the books I need?
Where's the Canadian embassy?
That's what Tom fears the most
How has it been since then?
Tom's light was on all night
Let's make some coffee
I'll pick you up around three
I'll walk to school
Tom wasn't alone this time
Do you watch a lot of sports?
Would you say you're shy?
That's it
I'm out of here
Does Tom always act that way?
You might've heard of it
I'll never leave Tom alone
I heard you, too
What a stylish hat!
That can't be good
I'll need to borrow your bike
Nobody could've helped
Are you guys having fun?
You'll like Boston
She doesn't love anyone
It's in fate's hands
Was anyone at home?
What'll we drink?
The bed isn't made
What an elegant hat!
Somebody's following us
I don't need anything else
Tom didn't need an audience
What is it with you today?
It'll grow back
I'll write to Tom at once
Who ate all the cake?
Nobody likes a tattle-tale
Is Tom still at the mall?
I'm meeting with Tom tonight
Don't drag Tom into this
Our son's name is Tom
What Tom did can't be changed
Who told you that I'd come?
I'd prefer to stay

It's an unethical industry
Is it for free?
May I sit behind you?
Shall I explain the joke?
You think Tom already knows?
What were you even thinking?!
Pee!
I don't drink while at work
Hat off!
Is Boston a sanctuary city?
Balthazar, at random!
It's at random, Balthazar!
He gave her a dressing-down
He gave him a dressing-down
And I'm still in love with her
Who gave you so much money?
Does she have a husband?
You don't know what trouble is
Let's hear it, curly!
How did you find this place?
I'm bigger than him
I'm laughing too hard
I know you are, but what am I?
Make sure you don't get scurvy
Where can I find firewood?
We're falling behind
What did you say happened?
We're out of cheese
Should we call in the cavalry?
She didn't ask me
Let's order a sandwich
Heck, it's not a big deal
Your dog is heckin' fast
Schucks, she noticed
Shoot, I almost died
I'm getting tired of this game
Has anyone noticed?
I haven't been there for years
Did my mother send you?
She's ashamed of me
Did my father die?
Let's see what Tom digs up
He's a sick man
Are you drunk?
He's a superstar
Don't buy more ice cream
I've changed since you met me
Let's park here," said Mary
Don't drink so much juice!
Don't honk the horn
Have you packed your bags?
Tom doesn't like pandemics
Where is your poodle?
Does this look bad?
That's a wolf
Yep, that sucks
Is this decaf coffee?
Look outside!
Did you buy sunflower seeds?
I'm not picky
I'll eat anything
I'm a mouse
There's a mouse in the pantry
Which lies tell the truth?
The coffee's cold
I'd like to try it
Now, that looks yummy
I'd like to try it
I'd like to try it
Don't feed the pigeons, please
I'd like to try it
You're doing it wrong.
That's enough nonsense
Don't eat all of the snacks
Can you get my wallet?
Where's the difference?
Quit kicking my seat!
She's a user/abuser
Do you take meds?
It's a fiat currency
She'll call soon
Can you check?
Maybe..
Look at the sky!
It's too humid out
That is what is happening.
Tom dated Mary, his doctor
Can you start over again?
Look out below!
It's colder than usual tonight
Let's go home together!
No shouting!
Alert the neighbors!
It's a complex algorithm
How's that possible?
May I try that on?
What kind of sport do you do?
It's not a bank
It's not a bank
My favorite color's orange
Is that why you hired me?
It'll be done in two minutes
Where's the magic?
It is seven p.m. here
I can't find my glasses
The tram leaves in 5 minutes
Don't worry
Ahhh, it's snack time
Ahh, it's dim sim time
I don't know which is better
I don't dare state my opinion
Do you speak Latin also?
Are you going to Boston too?
He's a physical freak
Why did he ask for it?
Heck!
Poor me!
Tom asked Mary to call 911
I couldn’t breathe
Is that going to be it?”
You're asking too much of me
Did you shave?
We're #1
Do you have tinnitus?
You are behind the mountain!
Where is the hero?
Ahh!
It broke!
A bunch of nonsense!
Listen quietly!
A dream come true!
Which painting is bigger?
Put on your stockings!
That trip was delightful!
She's very cautious
Don't always be like this!
Tell me what's wrong, Tom
Tom is dead.
What?
I've not had dinner
Would you care to join me?
I'd love to.
New look, same great taste!
Face your past!
You look tired, my dear
Can this be a sign?
I've made a splendid breakfast
Do you know how to make jam?
What are you boiling?
Two weeks quarantine?!
Oh my gosh!
Together with Mary at home?!
Me, I'm uninspired!
Why did I do that to her?
Is he also in her office?
Will he help me?

It's written on the label
How do you want to pay?
How much does this one cost?
OK, only this time, for you
Where are the slippers?
Do you know any of them?

Why did she believe that?
I won't get another chance
With what purpose?
We'll give you a ring
How do I access the dark web?
That was my rug!

They'll be hungry
Understood!
This is my sister.
Your sister?
Yes.
She's beautiful!
A girlfriend?
Yes.
Is she beautiful?
Please tell me more about her.
Is she beautiful?
Yes.
More beautiful than me?
He doesn't say a word
Don't lie, please!
It isn't hard
Do you have a fake beard?
Is it a real hook?
Is that eye patch real?
I love talking to you!
Tell me more!
What is behind that door?
It's the treasury
Shut your mouth!
You and what army?
I'm not a pirate
I'm thirsty for blood
You're getting too close
What side are you on?
I'm already an expert
It's so unfair!
It's a horrible skull
Have you lost something?
I'm too petrified to speak
No, I'm taking you seriously
It's a bottle
I've seen enough of him
Marry me!
It's a diamond ring
I'm a man of action
It's the engagement ring
It's been a very rough day
They're still friends today
Don't encourage them
I can't stop doing it
Tom couldn't stop doing it
Why do you not come back?
We're interested in politics
There's nothing to eat
Do you have to eat dinner?
She couldn't stop crying
Is Russia our enemy?
I don't believe that
And you?
It's a big stuffed crocodile
Do you know how to sing?
There's no time for that now
Never mind that now!
We have to hurry!
Where did you hide her?
Go, before it's too late
It'll be hard to get her back
When in doubt, forbear
Maybe you'd rather stay inside
What island is this?
What came?
Yeah, right
It's a lemonade pitcher
Have you already opened?
This one's gonna be good
Is the lemonade good?
It's a very healthy beverage
I'll have some lemonade
Was the lemonade bad?
I couldn't even taste it
Thank you, have a nice day
Come to the swamp!
I'll read your fortune
Visit our new place!
It's a henhouse
I don't see any chickens
It's a crow's nest
It's a magic wand
There's something inside
It's a glove
It's an old travel trunk
I don't need a prop
They're just fake swords
So quit it!
They say it's huge
Did I just say too much?
It's a comb
Take your hands off that comb!
I'm sure they can cut anything
Since when are you colorblind?
I'm still not very impressed
I don't want to insult you
Why can't we get along?
It's like a sauna in here
I'll have to amputate
You'll ruin my hair
I'm sorry, but no
I'll wait for the movie
It's attached to the vine
I can't remove it
We speak tamalṭit
I'm from Malawi
There's a snake in the garden
Tom's head is empty
It's very late
You know where Botswana is?

Can you hear the silence?
Can you hear the silence?
No, I can hear nothing.
Houston, we’ve had a problem
You can't walk on the beach
You can't use our towels
You mustn't!
Maybe I'll even sunbathe naked
It's full of dirty dishes
It's an ice bucket
I'll just take one more
It's incredibly white
You're very white
I'm so glad that you are here
I'm not a sailor
I'm hungry for your words
It wasn't very cold yesterday
Now it's full of dye
Here's your drink, sir
Can you list the months?
I'd better turn over
It's too complex
Who are you living with?
With my dog.
Don't you feel humiliated?
Get lost, then
I'd better keep quiet
It's a bowl of fruit
I'm not in the mood for fruit
Gross!
Yuck!
We're all monkeys
I'm glad it had a happy ending
Tom's door was half open
Tom's door was half shut
I'll take it as a compliment
He couldn't stop doing it
They couldn't stop doing it
Is this man married?
No, he's divorced.
Do you need it?
What kind of poison was it?
You look lovely.
You too.
I don't like Mary
Don't cough at me, asshole!
What kind of captain are you?
I'll take your loot
How scary!
I didn't want it anyway
Of course, I have my own copy
You won't live to regret it
I'm too lazy to cook
Let me read the diary.
No way.
Let's read each other's diary
It's my diary
We've lost again
She married him.
She's seeing other men
I'll let you choose
I've been defeated in battle
I think I'm on my own again
You'd better leave that
Don't scream!
I think you'd rather not know
I don't know how to say this
Now please, go
That's can't be good
Stop shouting at me!
Keep it down!
I don't think we've met
Could you repeat it?
I suppose you'd have to die
What's with the new guy?
I'm pretty sure he's dead
Is there life after death?
It's a big nail
Did you order pizza?
Did you order a pizza?
Did you guys order pizza?

Who pays you for that job?
Don't trust misogynists
What is the job description?
What's the job description?
How many people can say that?
I'm an Esperantist
That's a drag
Are you engaged?
You're very scary
I don't really have a chance
What happened to the light?
He can't stop messing around
It's a dead parrot
Who wants to hear about it?
I don't trust the weather
Don't let him see me!
Don't let her see me!
Don't let Tom see me!
Did you enjoy the pizza?
It's a list
It'll be great
It'll be fun
He isn't going to eat
I'm a snow expert
I'm an expert on snow
Oh, how bad I feel!
Oh yes, fuck me!
His t-shirt has faded
He didn't say much
I don't know how to play this
It's what the cat does
They all died in "car crashes.
He was financially well-off
That wasn't his intent
Is Tom dating anyone?
Is Tom dating anybody?
Is Mary dating anyone?
Is Mary dating anybody?
He didn't give enough effort
What is wrong with this guy?
He didn't give her enough time
He's just an alcoholic
He's not into men
His father isn't present
You're going to kill us all
Could you lift me up?
I don't find this confusing
Hold on, I need to jack off
You call that an upgrade?
It's so downmarket!
We can't reach them, Captain
We've lost comms
Is phishing illegal?
The kids won't listen to me
She's worried about his health
You're a great poet
More tea, vicar?
It had to be kinky, or nothing
You again!
That's completely implausible
OK, I was just asking
When did he arrive?
When did he get here?
You haven't done it yet
Why?
I don't get it
In 2020?
You have a cassette player?
It's not hard

Did you get plowed?
Cash works too.
How hard should I fuck you?
As hard as you can.
I'm going to make you squeal
Okay, just one handjob
You missed the best part!
Who am I trying to fool?
I'm having rice
I think he's got talent
I don't want to travel again
That's what he does best
I've seen something else
It's only a toy
I don't see much of her
What did you buy for lunch?
Did you say something?
What do you think I said?
Do you see them often?
Do you see much of them?
Do you see much of her?
They aren't happy to see them
Aren't you glad to see us?
It's an interesting read
In an address book, maybe?
Today's the premiere
That's not really my name
I'd rather you didn't
Do you know where he might be?
He's most likely there
Actually, I'm just an extra
Love is what we're made of
I don't know if you understand
What prize did he win?
Where is it held?
It's only for three days
We're that predictable
We'd love to help you
I'm here on Thursday
Is this normal?
I don't know.
Is this weird?
I don't know.
She's a bit dopey
Where did you find this meme?
I'm having soup
Could you look into it for me?
It's safer that way
If so, how much?
Can you show me the ropes?
Seeing the blood, she fainted
This time, I will get less
Am I older than your brother?
Put it away immediately!
That's an old one
Is it going to be scary?
It's very catchy
Let's hear it then
He's stealing my change
I suspect he's nuts
Now that's a challenge
I'd be proud to join your crew
I'm going to the court
Well, you'll manage
I don't want any trouble
I'm not afraid of my brother
Don't worry
Eat up and you won't starve
I don't see them again
I've already told you
Doesn't that ring a bell?
It's your word against his
She's protecting her brother
Do you doubt it?
You think I haven't noticed?
We haven't deceived you
What are you doing up here?
That is what I want to know.
I won't touch it
It's not even signed
I think he's going to say no
I don't mean that one
I'm not going to arrest you
You're a textbook psychopath
Read it yourself, if you like
Do you want some change?
Why did you start without me?
I'm happy to see you too
What did you do all that time?
It's dry
Just don't make it a habit
Has he been learning English?
Do you like learning English?
Tom is a small-town boy
Mary is a small-town girl
Can you have it both ways?
You left the door open?
You didn't hear anything?
When did you figure it out?
Why didn't you call anyone?
She's hiding something from us
I'm proud to be a teacher
He's hiding something from us
You went alone, didn't you?
You're not helping me at all
I don't want to answer anymore
We're recording everything
I'd rather stay in the room
Do you feel guilty about it?
Does he do that to you often?
Did he hit your sister too?
Why would she tell us that?
He's at her place

You won't see her anymore
You won't see them anymore
You won't see me again
You won't see him again
You won't see her again
You won't see them again
I won't see you anymore
He's a bad influence on them
She's so proud of him
He's their father
That's my point of view
Don't wait, just go
This weekend it's me
Next weekend it's him
I'm not cisgender
Sasha is gender-fluid
Avani is gender-fluid

I am joking!
I won't repeat it
Don't be such a sissy
A yardstick is 36 inches long
Some people aren't so lucky
That's a face I've seen before
She's from the Weser Uplands
That will teach us!
She's a common woman
Does he play baseball?
Does she play baseball?
Have you ever eaten a bat?
Tom's skills were not needed
Mary's skills were not needed
I said it wouldn't work
You didn't understand it
Don't expect any tax relief
I'm not that religious
Y'all stink
Is he still sick?
Don't be pretentious
He's pretentious
I'm a fraud
You're being pretentious
You're all pretentious
You're pretentious
Am I pretentious?
You fraud!
You charlatan!
The truce didn't last long
It's written in Russian
Where did he go last Friday?
Hi, it's me
Hi, it's me, Tom
Tom just stopped by to say "hi
Hi, my name is Tom
What's yours?
Mary didn't even say hi to me
The grass won't grow

Did they make it?
I won't disappoint you anymore
Why am I supposed to go there?
She's a mathematician
We'd like to help him
I'm from Afrin
He's a mathematician
There's no one like Tom
There's no one like her
There's no one like him
How did you meet?
I can't answer your questions
Do you even have balls?
Watch while grazing!
Is this blood?
I won't help you with that
We're stronger
You're stronger than us
You're stronger than we are
His day will come!
Are you playing volleyball?
Is it written in Finnish?
When will you finish?
Can you repair my computer?
You're a programmer, after all
Don't yell so loudly
You've got to see it
It's an important question
I don't buy bread
I've chosen
Whose documents are these?
We're going to be disappointed
I'll wear a shirt
I'm going to wear a shirt
We're not going to waste time

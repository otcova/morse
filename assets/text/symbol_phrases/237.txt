Have you taken a bath yet?
How am I supposed to help?
Even Tom doesn't dance anymore
How do you intend to help?
Even Tom would've been shocked
How were you able to help?
We're waiting for dinner
Weren't you at home?
I've learned a lot since then
We want to have fun, too
Were you able to sit down?
Why don't you take a seat?
I wasn't at home last night
It's time to bury the hatchet
Tom!
This is insane!
Would you like me to sing?
We know you're very rich
Could that possibly happen?
You can be very sure!
Admirable!
It's almost done!!
Enjoy your life!
A day of the best!
How did you learn to dance?
I didn't know Tom was that old
We haven't forgotten you
How do you plan on helping?
I didn't tell Tom not to dance
We haven't abandoned you
How do you propose to help?
I didn't think Tom would dance
We don't need to do that
How do you propose we help?
I don't believe Tom will dance
How do you suggest we help?
I don't know Tom that well yet
Tom's hands are small
Why would I tell you?
We can't do what we want
How do you want me to help?
I feel bad that Tom isn't here
We've got to start over
Who taught you how to swim?
We're updating the site
Open your books to page 30
Is Tom in a good mood?
Give me that magazine, please
How come you didn't call me?
I'll be back in no time
Shhh!
She's coming, she'll hear you!
Shhh!
He's coming, he'll hear you
You're flogging a dead horse
I don't like this movie
Where is the waitress?
The dog really couldn't talk
We'll wait for you here
Could you wrap it as a gift?
Do you really want to dance?
Don't ask me to dance again
Don't walk home by yourself
I know Tom won't want to dance
How could you possibly help?
It's dangerous to play here
We're getting stronger
Where did I do that?
Does that go there?
It's not illegal to do that
We're about to go home
Why didn't you sing with us?
We'll miss you tonight
You can't go shopping today
We weren't complaining
We should do this, too
Didn't I ask you not to help?
I still haven't heard from Tom
Germs!
Don't shake my hand!
I don't care what others think
What's wrong with my hair?
I'm not very good at this.
Neither am I.
That hat is too floppy!
I love it!
Tom didn't like Mary's salad
Careful!
It's a hot plate
Do I really have to eat this?
I think Tom must've been right
Do you really have to go now?
I think Tom would've disagreed
Do you really think I'd help?
How are you planning to help?
We're still too young
How do you expect me to help?
We're not complaining
Is this really a light beer?
How do you expect us to help?
That's a risk we had to take
That's not surprising at all
I want to speak to Tom, please
Where did you learn to dance?
Where can we sit?
What time is it in Australia?
She can't hold anything down
Why should we sing that song?
Would you cook dinner for me?
Where is my soft drink?
Didn't I ask you not to dance?
Didn't I tell you not to help?
Do you have friends in Boston?
Do you really want me to help?
We hope it isn't true
I'd like to ask Tom a question
I'd like to go skiing with Tom
Some people can't sing at all
I'll definitely try to see Tom
Does she have any allergies?
Does Tom have any allergies?
What's Tom allergic to?
Is Tom allergic to peanuts?
Tom's excuse was pathetic
Who ate all the fruit?
They're all pigs
Whatever you want, dear
I'm having a panic attack
Sir, the water is brown
You're a total loser
It's so basic
He thinks he's Spock
Where are the goats?
How are you helping?
Fish again?
What's the matter again?
She's a plastic bitch
What is the purpose of this?
There's no point in repeating
I don't like rice
I'm taking a crap
They're raking it in
What in the world!
Hold up!
I'm contemplating both
I can't shake this feeling
Does it have a pulse?
Why is she burning her novel?
Did you finish?
She's a poison pill
What were your past purchases?
Do you want a receipt?
That's a risk we have to take
I'll relay your message to Tom
We shouldn't ask why
There's nothing wrong, I hope
I'm glad to meet you, too, Tom
I'm sure Tom doesn't want that
We haven't lost much
Who here isn't busy right now?
I'm sure Tom will be just fine
We can't do that yet
Who here isn't from Australia?
I'm tired of hearing about Tom
We'll see you again
I'm very sorry I voted for Tom
I've met Tom quite a few times
We can't allow this
We didn't have time to see Tom
We aren't Canadians
What were your expectations?
Of course, how could I say no?
How does this remote work?
Tom was self-published
Were you exposed to anything?
My house is not a Petri dish!
It's best not to mention that
And how is your meal?
Did you enjoy the salad?
Do you have a secret menu?
We've run aground
Do you like your soup?
I can't find the salt shaker
Can you get our bags?
Are you intact?
Do you want to play online?
I'm the local expert
Who packed your bag?
Where is the bus schedule?
What time is your flight?
Is this where we get off?
Tom can't stop vomiting
It's in your bag
I like your T-shirt
Please, no obscene language
Quick, a woman is drowning!
I don't understand the plot
Can you empty Mary's pockets?
You've got the map upside down
Do you know how to read a map?
Who benefits from all of that?
Who benefits from this attack?
Do you wanna sleep?
It's me who paid the book
Where is the bank machine?
Look at the positive side!
Will this be enough?
Not on my watch!
It's a serious decision
She didn't return the favor
She is self-absorbed
Did you bring enough water?
Is this your child?
Can I have a ginger ale?
It's gluten free!
I've lost your lighter again
Have you taken your break?
I'm the exception to the rule
Funny, we all have diarrhea
Can you speak?
Let's skinny dip
Why do I travel with you!
I don't remember your password
Do you have any dirty laundry?
Are these your orange pants?
I'm ecstatic!
Do you want to carve the bird?
Are you still in the shower?
I can't dance holding a drink
Do you like absurd humor?
I feel punch-drunk
I'm going to concur
Where is your first aid kit?
What is the emergency number?
Jump aside!
Do you have any powdered milk?
She can't hold a tune
We're still active
We're getting old
We're always here
Mr. Jackson is a great teacher
We're already old
We couldn't do it
You'll get your share tomorrow
Are these suitcases yours?
I can't do that yet
I've always been here for you
I've always been there for you
It's the beginning of the end
Aren't they adorable together?
Aren't they cute together?
They're so cute together
Tom's in a meeting right now
I can't help anymore
I can't walk anymore
I don't like dancing
The Russian T-34 tank won WWII
I don't sing anymore
I don't want to sing
I didn't want to help
I don't dance anymore
I don't feel any pain
I'm happy we did that
I'm not good at piano
I've sung all my life
I'd rather not be here
I'm not that surprised
Did you call the plumber?
This is my mother's recipe
What did she tell you?
What can we do about this?
Mary's heart skipped a beat
She didn't seem to mind
He didn't seem to mind
I'll put it in the box
I'm a senior at Harvard
I'm not scared of women
I can help if you'd like
I didn't plan on helping
I don't think I'll dance
I really, really need it
I've been asked to leave
I believe that you'll win
I fell asleep around 2:30
I owe you an apology, too
I'll teach you how to sing
Tom can't sing as well as Mary
Tom replied to Mary's email
Slow and always!
What are her motives?
I'm going to be there soon
Every day has 1440 minutes
Tom I thank you for coming!
It hurts but that's ordinary
Tom where are the tea towels?
Get out of my head!
Get out!
I usually sleep at 11
He's very good at maths
Is that your teacher?
Your pronunciation is superb!
Why don't you know it?
Why don't we have a house?
Certainly!
The parents didn't agree
Did no one help you?
One doesn't live to learn
I don't have any cigarettes
Give me just one cigarette!
Good day Tom!
What do they want?
I think I'm crazy
I'm a graduate of Harvard
I didn't have time to read
Tom wouldn't take this chance
I don't believe I can help
Tom wouldn't have hurt anyone
Tom won't let anyone touch it
Tom won't answer the question
Tom won't accomplish anything
I'm not going to back down
Tom picks up his dog's waste
Did you see the rainbow today?
Tom washed Mary's car for her
What is your favorite food?
Do you want popcorn?
Can we get a dog?
Did anything happen to her?
Did anything happen to him?
Tom's cat had nine kittens
We're not buying those jeans
Does Tom have a pulse?
Tom's manners are impeccable
Would you like a sandwich?
When is dinner served?
I didn't want to go outside
I don't see anybody dancing
Tom was wrong about that, too
I haven't danced in a while
I shouldn't comment on that
I still don't believe I won
I think they're a good team
From where do you hail?
I'd rather not sing tonight
I'll let you know on Monday
Tom was born October 20, 2013
I'm not going to be a coach
My jelly won't set
I haven't seen the film
Don't spoil it for me!
Continue?
I didn't mind helping at all
I didn't really want to help
I don't really want to dance
I don't recommend doing that
I don't think this is enough
I don't like watery food
I know I should've done that
I'm at the police station
I know that I didn't do that
I'd prefer not to sing today
Here's my drivers license
I can't feel sorry for myself
I can't really cook very well
Mary doesn't love me
Mary doesn't love me anymore
I don't feel like dancing now
I don't have time to help now
What do you fear?
I don't walk anywhere anymore
God, forgive me of my sins
God, have mercy on me
God, I am a sinner
Tom said that's just not true
When will I be free?
I'm not sweating
I'm literally on a treadmill
I haven't sung in a long time
I think I'm prepared for that
How dare you use me like this!
How dare you make fun of Tom!
How dare you say that to me!
How dare you do that to Tom!
How dare you call me stupid!
How dare you call me a fool!
How dare you do that to me!
How dare you doubt me!
How dare you do this!
How dare you defy me!
I don't believe!
Sorry Tom, I don't believe you
I'd rather not sing that song
I'll be out of town next week
I'm running for office
Did you bring a towel?
Where is the locker?
Do you have a comb?
Watch the baby's fingers
I'm tempted to just stay home
I can't really dance very well
I don't think it'll be too hot
Tom must've studied very hard
I don't think it'll get better
I don't think that'll continue
I know I'm not good at singing
Tom likes to play tennis, too
I never would've believed that
I think I could've done better
Where's your locker?
Doesn't Tom live here?
There's no toilet paper!
I'll be in Boston this weekend
I'll wait until tomorrow night
I've just returned from a trip
Tom is one of Mary's students
It's too much effort
Tom is Mary's most famous son
Tom hasn't washed the car yet
Don't worry
You'll get better at it
You'll get better at it
That's so sweet of you
How was the skiing?
Are you free Friday night?
Are you free tomorrow morning?
I'm on my way to Tom's house
I'd like you to meet my son
I'm not coming
I don't want Tom to find out
I don't want Mary to find out
The décor is drab
Tom's been looking for you
Tom doesn't want to go to bed
Tom doesn't speak good French
Tom doesn't have any siblings
Tom doesn't flaunt his wealth
Tom didn't intend to hurt you
Can somebody answer the phone?
I don't like you
I'm sorry
I don't have a TV
What do you do after work?
I don't have a radio
So, what do you want to do?
I'll beep him
I'm bad at keeping secrets
Tom looked at Mary's name tag
Tom read Mary's name tag
Do you like chocolate icing?
I am a Scorpio, but gentle
How about dinner?
Tom couldn't possibly succeed
Tom could've done much better
Don't be so impetuous
It's not how it seems
He wasn't surprised at all
She wasn't surprised at all
I wasn't surprised at all
Watch out below!
Don't twist my elbow
I'm allergic to shellfish
Don't bring sand into the bed
I'm the local authority here
Where is your recycle bin?
I've lost the car keys
Why didn't the bus stop?
Tennis, anyone?
Will you be long?
Time's almost up?
Is the damage permanent?
I can sing," said Tom
His brother can't sing
He won't do
You're really useless
Shoot.
Next question!
Do you recognize this man?
Can't say I do.
Don't tell me you're jealous
Why don't you try it on?
Why don't you try this one on?
Don't be such a wimp
What about this one?
What about this dress?
Why don't you try it?
Maybe you'll like it
What is the best episode?
Is this your stuff?
We'll be at the drum circle
It's like a living postcard
Good pick!
You don't think he's cute?
You don't think she's cute?
I'll send you his picture
I'll send you her picture
I'll send you Tom's picture
Don't be so selfish
I don't like watching TV
I only don't want to marry you
I've got everything I need
Yeah, just about.
I think we're just about there
I think we're almost there
I think we're almost finished
Which horse did you bet on?
That's all you think about
I'm different from other guys
I'm not like the other girls
You're really a nice person
It's really hot out here
Have you seen my friend?
Why do you want to know?
I'm just curious.
What about you, Tom?
Do you like mashed potatoes?
Why is my computer slow?
Can you identify this animal?
Tom said he couldn't help me
Why are tears salty?
Why is sweat salty?
A few days later, he was dead
Did she learn to ride a bike?
There's a letter for you
Let's get takeout
I can't stand my roommate
Tom loves me, and I love Tom
Tom knows that I'll call you
Does it rain a lot in Germany?
I don't think that's strange
No, not at all
Please call me anytime.
I can't wait till tomorrow
He's much better
I'll sing you a lullaby
Go to sleep, sweetheart
I'm looking after Jim
I'm so itchy
I'll make some broth for you
That's kind of you, Lisa
You musn't scratch your spots
Do people have free will?
Tom isn't as old as he seems
Is this the way to Berlin?
I looked like I'd seen a ghost
I don't believe in Santa Claus
You can't land there
What's going on this time?
Did you see that, Jamal?
What if I don't pass?
Listen, gentlemen
You're grounded for a week
He's new around here
I'm just explaining
It's the wrong way to do it
Jamal, you try
Why do we need to learn this?
You've beaten me six times
I'm stopping
I have to do something, guys
We're under attack, guys!
You made a promise, Jamal
You're our hero
It's your turn, Jim
I'm the doctor
You don't have that, right?
It didn't work out, did it?
Did he fall for it?
Sorry, it doesn't fit
Hey!
Where is everybody?
Come back here, man!
It's so bad
How do you guys know?
He's not here today
It's dangerous
It's happening all over again
Would it work?
Can you show me your new car?
I'm Jamal
Nice to meet you.
I'm Sarah.
Hey, Jim!
We're here, Jamal
Oh, I see
Do you promise?
Yeah, I promise.
I just don't care
Is he in trouble again?
He's not here tonight
Is he moving away forever?
Are you talking about Jenny?
What do you mean he's leaving?
He didn't come to school today
We heard he's moving for good
Thanks for telling me, Jim
He didn't even call me
He didn't even tell me
Come on, Jim
What's going on, Jim?
I'm really gonna miss you
Here you go, Jim
Thanks, Jim
This is the magician's hat
It's Jim the magician
I'm so glad you love it
I wonder what's going on here
What's going on, Sarah?
We're coming to the rescue
I'm just doing my job, Jim
Is that so weird?
You're Jim, right?
Nice work, Jim
Let's call him now
How do you know my name?
You must be Jim's friends
I'm sorry guys
You're Tom, right?
I'm so tired today
I'm Jim's friend, Tom
Hey!
Wait!
What's wrong with you, guys?
It's nothing.
It's not nothing.
He thinks he's too good for us
Do you see him?
Tom is a highly-educated man
It's me, Jim
Is he really ignoring me?
I can't hear you very well
Can you speak up?
I knew it, Jim!
I knew it!
I've always been alone
What?
No way!
I'm going to bed now
It's not safe
It's too high up
I'm sure
Well Jim, we're on our way now
Leave it to me, guys
It's always the same voice
That's enough for me, guys
You can count on me, Jim
Please don't mind him
Why did you let Jim go?
You did it, didn't you?
Is that a fire truck?
Are you talking to me, man?
Hey, sist!
What a cute kid!
Let's go see Jim
Tom hasn't yet returned home
Tom hasn't signed a contract
Tom hasn't reimbursed me yet
Tom hasn't read the book yet
Tom has a son who's a doctor
I know what you mean, Jamal
You don't have to watch this
He's right, Jamal
You've done a good job, Jamal
No!
It can't be!
I think he's in love with her
I think she's in love with him
Why did I get a D?
Why did I get a C?
How many clocks did you have?
How many watches did you have?
Do you speak Kotava?
Listen, alien
Tom doesn't run this company
Tom doesn't even remember me
Tom doesn't do anything else
I'll pick you up at eight
Tom didn't explain it at all
Tom didn't even eat any cake
Tom didn't even buy a ticket
Maybe it's just a coincidence
Do you love me?
Of course I love you.
Tom can't sing as well as me
Tom's room was a large room
Tom likes music, doesn't he?
Tom isn't afraid of spiders
I feel I'm a good person
Very well!
Well!
Are you ignoring me?
Why are they looking at me?
Why are they staring at me?
Tom's father was a teacher
Tom won't like living here
Tom probably can't do that
Tom got here at about 2:30
What is Romanticism?
Tom would've been shocked
Tom should've let me sing
Do you need a lawyer?
Do you wanna come visit us?
I'll stay here tonight
I'm so worried
I'll take care of it, guys
I'll be just fine
Let's get there quickly
They'll be surprised
How am I supposed to use this?
Watch me now, Jamal
Why are you looking at me?
Is it something on my face?
He doesn't even apologize
You're so smart, Jamal
See?
Do you wanna try going in?
I'm a bit late
Are you scared already?
I'm finally out
What should we do now, Jamal?
Don't be embarrassed, Jamal
I can't sleep tonight
Are you back already?
The sun already set?
I'm bored
I'll watch TV
Tom said he'd sort it out
Tom promised he'd tell us
Tom promised he'd help us
You must be Tom's friends
You all must be Tom's friends
Why don't we take a break?
Why did you let Tom do that?
Today's my day off
Has the sun already set?
Let's call Tom now
Why is Tom ignoring me?
I'm Tom's friend, Mary
It's orange
How do you guys know Tom?
Tom isn't here tonight
I thought it'd be harder
Are these your pictures?
What type of work did he do?
You must wash your hands!
Pay attention to priority!
You, stay still!
Tom didn't wash his hair
Tom didn't talk about it
Would you like a small coffee?
Tom isn't able to dance
Tom doesn't live nearby
Tom didn't pay the bill
Tom won't let you sing
Tom isn't able to walk
Tom didn't let me sing
Tom didn't even say hi
Tom says that's wrong
I'll have the same as usual
What'll you have?
The same as usual.
She's a troublemaker
Tom's house is tidy
Tom can't do that yet
Stop interrupting me!
How mad are you?
Tom doesn't care for ice cream
I'm a terrible housekeeper
How young is too young?
How could it work?
Tom doesn't deserve any praise
I'm a Canadian
How will you help?
Tom doesn't read books
Tom doesn't know why he's here
How smart are they?
Tom doesn't need too much help
How old is too old?
How fat is too fat?
How salty is too salty?
I don't think it's just me
I won't eat that
How will I do that?
I'm still in bed
How bad will it get?
I can't sing well
Has it ever happened before?
How nervous are you?
I think it's safe
How do we pay for it?
How will Tom do that?
I wasn't impressed
How romantic are you?
We don't see him very often
I'm broke right now
How sad and pathetic!
We don't see Tom very often
We don't see Tom much anymore
I'm proud of myself
Yes, I'm proud
You're not to lecture me
I'm willing to wait
How's life in Boston?
How's your golf game?
Why is Tom resigning?
How are your children?
How could Tom do this?
How great is the risk?
How did Tom apologize?
How many are too many?
Can I put forth a question?
How tough is your job?
I know we'll find Tom
Well, let's see!
And then, what next?
I'm feeling a little sick
What can I do now?
What's this noise?
Is it a train?
Hold this, please
Are you Jamal Sadiq?
I'm a big fan!
I'm a famous person now
Are we famous now?
I can't believe it
It's Fadil
Oh, my back
Could you hurry it back?
I'm a bit busy
Let's go, Jamal
Oh, he left
Let's go to the car wash
What should I do, Jamal?
Why are you up so late?
It's not my working hour
Could you give me a ride home?
Are you sick?
Why are you asking that?
I should thank you.
What for?
I'm sure Tom must be worried
Can we start if you're ready?
That's where I wanna be
That's where I wanna live
That's where I want to live
That's where I want to be
We can begin if you're ready
We can start if you're ready
I'll count on you like always
It's been a busy day today
Do you wanna come with me?
I'm a little tired, actually
I didn't know you were here
So who's this guy?
How would you do this?
I wish we'd done that
How busy are you today?
This is my friend, Jamal
Let's play tag together
Stop right there, I said
Let's go to school for now
I won't do this again
How can we help people?
What's that place?
Do you recognize this place?
That's right
You know very well?
What's that funny sound?
Did you just fart?
That's all Jamal's fault
Let's do it again, guys
I'm going home to bed
How dangerous was that?
I'll show you
Let's go visit Tom
Let's go visit Tom in Boston
Let's go see if Tom is at home
I'm not ready to stop
How did you get so fat?
I'm really scared now
So where's the fire?
You're very good together
Have you finished filling?
Can you come down slowly?
Why did they become so close?
I had a lot of fun, too
Stop right now!
Am I right this time?
So what was that about?
You can go now, I guess
How tough was the test?
We can't let Tom sing
I've run out of ideas
How come you don't sing?
He's a pathological liar
I couldn't go anywhere
How did it go yesterday?
You go first, Jamal
We'll go first
Are you lost by any chance?
I don't wanna get on
You're making me laugh
How did the fight begin?
See?
It isn't scary, right?
That's our job
That's what we're here for
What's tickling me?
I wonder what's wrong, Jamal
What was the call about?
We've really had a good match
Where is he rushing to?
I'm already late for school
At least we're not late
It's not time to fool around
Very well done, Jamal
That doesn't seem right at all
Shall we go now, guys?
Can you make me a cup of tea?
You'll like it very much
So shall we go now?
When are you coming?
It's all thanks to Jamal
Why isn't Jamal coming?
So you wanna do this?
Am I too late, guys?
Where have you been, Jamal?
You didn't leave yet
Aren't you angry?
So how did you find them?
Let's play together next time
Are you that lost?
By now, he must be starving
I don't really feel like it
Don't lie to me
You did that to Jamal?
She's married to Jamal
She's with Jamal
Has Jamal been around?
Where did Jamal go?
It's me, Jamal
Where are you?
Here's the room key
What are you waiting for?
Let's go
That's how I live
I'm studying and also working
I'm a little too young
Did you manage to call Jamal?
I hope you'll like them
I'll never let you go

Won't you sit down?
How are all your folks?
I'm very glad to see you
Am I talking too much?
I don't mind
How do you start your Monday?
I'm interested in that
How else can we do this?
I'm glad I was with Tom
I'm looking for my dog

What good would she be to us?
Why can't you do that?
How bad a driver are you?
I've always lived here
How bad is your headache?
It's a big tree
Oh, isn't it wonderful?
I'm pretty hungry this morning
Yes, you may wash the dishes
Isn't it lovely?
I love it, but I can't wear it
Isn't the sea wonderful?
That's the White Sands Hotel

No.
How can it get any worse?

Tom doesn't like fast food
Tom prefers home-cooked meals
We couldn't help ourselves
Except those, I guess
I couldn't move my arms
I'm not too concerned
As for myself, I'm OK
I'll handle it later
Can I use yours?
I can't lose
How old is your younger son?
None of us liked Tom's idea
These are my books, not Tom's
This is my bicycle, not Tom's
The fame got to Tom's head
Is Tom a friend?
You're a very patient teacher
Where's the market?
She doesn't eat meat
It doesn't eat meat
Elephants don't eat meat
They're a good singer
I'll have to do that for Tom
Tom turned down Mary's offer
Tom can't afford a new bicycle
Well done, everybody
Dost thou love me?
Therapy's the answer
I've never had a dog
I can't get jar open
Everybody, calm down
I don't want to eat meat
Not so fast with the medicine!
We're all happy now
When do giraffe calves wean?
They haven't done anything
This isn't theirs
How are you doing?
Ēalā!
Iċ hatā Ēadweard
Hey!
I'm Edward
Everything's tidy
He doesn't like it here
That's beyond our control
It's been a tough week for us
It's not like Tom can beat me
This isn't ours
Don't be so dramatic, Tom!
It's wide and broad
It wasn't of benefit for her
That's the spot
Are we going surfing?
I'll go as I am
We're all fine
This isn't a new policy
I'm glad Tom is safe now
Does Algiers have skyscrapers?
Algiers needs car-free streets
Why did you choose Algiers?
Is Algiers a good city?
Is Algiers comfortable?
I've already seen enough
Is Algiers a successful city?
Let's have dinner in Algiers
I've had a very hard day
Tom's love life is a mess
I've seen crazier things
Ask Tom when he'll be back
It'll be hard to explain
Don't listen to me!
Tom has a three-year old son
How fast can a giraffe run?
How fast do giraffes run?
I wouldn't include it
Sorry, I don't know
Ask someone else.
We've a lot to thank Tom for
I didn't think Tom had a shot
I've been traveling a lot
I'm glad that Tom is safe now
I've had my ups and downs
Let's order another round
A screamer isn't a singer
I won't rest till I'm dead
I'm just talking to myself
I've been there many times
Algeria can't be defeated
I've just met a new friend
Does Algeria ban Berber names?
Can Algeria grow rich again?
How could I ever forget you?
Who's piloting that airplane?
I think we've made an error
I won't rest until I'm dead
I'd never heard that before
I've never experienced that
I've spent time here before
That's all I'll say for now
I think that's inappropriate
Algeria first!
Tom doesn't hate me
Oh, my God, I love Algiers!
Tom can't stay there
I don't know anyone in Algeria
She's married to her job
She's married to her career
She's married to her company
Tom can't help me today
Tom doesn't go to school
Give me a bottle of wine!
My uncle's dog bit me
Tom can't speak to you today
Tom doesn't know much about me
Tom doesn't know much about us
Tom doesn't know where we went
I know Tom wouldn't hit Mary
Tom doesn't know where I work
You won't find work here
Did you find the leak?
Don't be so narrow-minded
I've never eaten sushi
Don't take off your shoes
Don't take your shoes off
It's my job to do that
I've opened the window
That's part of the job
Does Algeria have wind farms?
That fear isn't unfounded
I don't like ideologies
Mluvíval jsem rusky, ale už ne
You'll never find Tom in time
We couldn't find Tom anywhere
He fled Algeria in 2004
This one's even better
They're singing in Berber
Tom couldn't find his way out
It's raining in Algiers
That's not why Tom wants that
He showed up at about 3:30
He should be back by 3:30
He should be back before 3:30
You won't be able to find Tom
Maybe we'll never find Tom
Later that night, Tom died
Do you still need it?
Do you still need them?
Tom found Mary's necklace
Was that part of the plan?
Tom's dog has been found
Where do you live exactly?
You'll find out when I do
I'll come back again later
I'm driving back to Algiers
I've experienced it myself
Let's say it in French
It's your job to find it
They're waving Algerian flags
How do you view your life?
I'll find you another table
If it's there, I'll find it
If you don't know, find out
Tom found Mary's dog
We're staying in Algeria
It's harvest time in Algeria
We didn't find any bombs
You didn't ask me
I'm very proud of Algeria
Tom probably didn't mind
You've misjudged me
You've never hurt me
You won't learn much from Tom
Nevertheless, he went there
You saw me, didn't you?
How long has Tom worked here?
You should've asked me
Why did you hide from me?
I don't find Tom at all funny
Watch out, a dog!
You'll tell me, won't you?
I find Tom's voice irritating
You all hate me, don't you?
Do you all hate me?
You both saw me, didn't you?
You can't trust the police
You did warn me, didn't you?
You didn't see me, did you?
I'm not a moviegoer
Here's what's happening
You're just flat out wrong
That's all part of the plan
That's just part of the job
What do you like?
What don't you like?
I'm just that kind of person
This wasn't so easy to find
We're determined to do this
Where did you find this map?
You all hated me, didn't you?
You both hate me, don't you?
You live near me, don't you?
You all despise me, don't you?
I don't think this is normal
I'm trying to find a way out
I've experienced that myself
I've had too many close calls
This isn't what we asked for
Is my translation OK?
Tom never says "thank you.
He says it's raining
I'm relining the shelves
We're going to divide up work
I can't take it back
It's against store policy
Thanks for all you've done
It's good Tom is on the job
He didn't hear me
We're eating pizza
We're getting tattoos
That's what he called it
He's back from the market
He's eating meat
He's wearing a condom
He's gonna believe that
He's ready for bed already
He's taking a history test
Let's all go out for dinner
It's on me
He's a man and I'm a woman
He's gonna lose his lunch
Where's my Berber workbook?
He's so generous
He can't buy that
He's all dressed up
He's really lost
He's Algerian, isn't he?
He's Algerian, isn't he?
What difference does it make?
He's not coming tonight
Has he ever been married?
He's interested in Skura
He's acting like a spy
He's in the broom closet
He's an expert lip reader
He's going for a walk
He's a generous man
He's a caring man
He's a dead man
That's all he did
She's a fashion model
He can't decide who to choose
How did his car get dented?
Has he ever lied to you?
Didn't you hear me honking?
Into the kitchen, Skura.
What?
I want to talk to you.
He's doing it again
Let's go.
Finally.
What's he doing?
What's he writing?
He's a lousy photographer
When will it rain again?
The weather today is minging!
The weather today is mingin'!
It's filthy weather today!
Don't sweat it, Tom
Who are these jokers?
Do you know the address?
That's an idealistic notion
They haven't answered me yet
I've done a truly stupid thing
I don't like chicken
Are the rivers in Africa big?
What's yours?
You're right as usual
Is Algeria an emerging market?
He's being treated in Algeria
You agree with me, don't you?
It could be worse!
He's an Algerian journalist
I'm not a xenophobe
I'm using wireless headphones
Can Tebboune rebuild Algeria?
Are you sure it's his?
He's the best runner
He'll go there tomorrow
He thinks it'll rain tomorrow
He shouldn't have said that
He doesn't like pets
It's hard to find steady work
May I leave my suitcases here?
That's how we dealt with that
Who gave Tom those coins?
Who gave Tom that money?
Who gave Tom so much money?
Who else should I talk to?
When did Tom leave here?
What's Tom's new car like?
She's the best runner
She'll go there tomorrow
She thinks it'll rain tomorrow
She shouldn't have said that
She doesn't like pets
He's in high school
She's in high school
You're his friend, aren't you?
You can't rely on her
Who gave him those coins?
Who gave him that money?
Who gave him so much money?
Who gave her those coins?
Who gave her that money?
Who gave her so much money?
Who does she work for?
Where was she working then?
When did she leave here?
What made him so sad?
What's his new car like?
What's her new car like?
What's he doing now?
That's only part of the story
Why are all the cabinets open?
You all missed me, didn't you?
They've been to Mexico
I've decided to shave my head
You'll wait for me, won't you?
I'm finding it hard to breathe
I've never eaten kangaroo meat
It's just a part of the puzzle
How do you clean your towels?
How do you wash your towels?
How do I deodorize my towels?
This towel is very, very soft
This towel is 100% cotton
How do I care for my towels?
The towels didn't bleach
What is this towel made of?
It's terrific
What does this towel feel?
What do you know about towels?
I'm also from Algiers
Where are you from?
Algiers.
It's too rough
This towel is 100% pure linen
How much is this towel?
Which towel is your favorite?
I love this towel.
You can have it.
Are these towels free?
He's done folding the towels
Gasoline isn't free in Algeria
When did Tom pop the question?
Has Tom popped the question?
He fled to Algeria in 2004
Algeria hasn't changed
Do you feel safe in Algeria?
Here's my question
That's my question
It's a great question
He's insulting God
It's a tough question
That's not in question
Tom didn't ask any question
That's not my question
Here's another question
It's a serious question
They aren't for you
That's the big question
He's out of Algeria
That's the main question
Do you have family in Algeria?
That's a popular question
Now, leave Tom to himself
That's a serious question
What future awaits Algeria?
I told him that Tom isn't here
That's the major question
Our lives are in God's hands
There's singing in Berber.
It's wonderful.
He's keeping a blog in Berber
We're on Muslim soil
Can we go inside the mosque?
It’s everything but that
Algerians can't escape this
Do Algerians pay well?
You shouldn't question it
He's now a refugee in Algeria
We're here in Algiers
That's how I learned Berber
That's an obvious question
That's not a hard question
There's no questioning that
Don't question my patriotism
It's an interesting question
It's my job to ask questions
They'll kill you!
They'll kill you all!
A judge's job is to judge
When in doubt, hug it out
Here's a question for you all
It's OK to ask hard questions
It's only a question of money
That's my number one question
Don't touch this
Tom's favorite animal is horse
Why not?
We're looking for oil
That's a very old tree
I've done a very stupid thing
Don't ask me so many questions
That's one way you can help me
That's what we aim to find out
It's about time I went home
Is it OK to smoke here?
Yes, it is.
He was twenty-four
I'm not Algerian
He loves Matoub's songs
He loves Matoub's style
We moved to Bejaia, Algeria
Thanks, anyway!
He wasn't alone anymore
He doesn't need a job
He's not far from the hotel
He didn't see them again
She's a very small weak woman
He has a high-class hotel
There's police around
He's a bald guy
He doesn't hear very well
I don't want to repeat myself
How much do you drink?
He didn't follow me
He's a bald-headed idiot
He just didn't care
He couldn't get out
His mom is a good-looking lady
If you want a job, call me
He's still scared
He's still on campus
He's still in college
He isn't scared anymore
He's tall, slim, and blond
I haven't had any coffee
She's super fit
She's not that pretty
I'm gonna break your neck
Do you cosplay?
He didn't stay there
She's a new hijabi
She's a woman of faith
Dad, I want to wear the hijab.
Do whatever is best for you.
What does hijab mean to you?
That's extremely interesting
He's an Algerian lawmaker
We're in Algeria
Why would you steal a car?
Did you learn your lesson?
Did you face any consequences?
Were there any repercussions?
Your ferret is a thief.
That makes sense.
Surely Tom does not eat meat?
Surely Tom doesn't eat meat?

They're heading to Algeria
I'm not fluent in French
How did you get your start?
How did Tom get his start?
Could you toss me an orange?
He's a former North Korean spy
Why did you start doing that?
I want to be a Berber teacher.

Tom's proposal was a good one
The dog goes "woof-woof
Have you got a cat or a dog?
Do you have a cat or a dog?
The music hasn't changed
Why have you brought a violin?
I'd like to make some music.
That's a brilliant idea
Why did you bring a violin?
That's a brilliant idea
Don't wait long – get started!

What does Tom want, anyway?
Tom's death was a surprise
Do you know who helped Tom?
Why don't we just do that?
We don't understand him
We don't understand her
Boston wasn't where we met
I really don't like chicken
I don't really like chicken
I can't face the past
I'm learning Berber.
Why Berber?
Apply the band-aid properly
Take off that band-aid
Peel back that band-aid
Does he need money?
She'll buy bread
Do you know this word?
I'm going to wash off now
It's about your sister
Tom isn't a lazy boy
Tom's eyes were open
Tom's eyes were shut
It all started in 2013
Tom's eyes were closed
Tom started crying, too
Tom's eyes weren't open
Tom's speech was perfect
Is Tom innocent or guilty?
Alright, I'm going for a wee
Who's only Chinese?
He's well known in Algeria
I think I'll stay out of this
What was life like in the 60s?
I hope I've helped in some way
I'm not going to turn away
I'm going to try to stay away
That's not going to go away
That isn't going to go away
It's not going to go away
Tom isn't far away
It's all lies
Why did Daesh bomb this house?
Who kidnapped him?
Daesh.
Do you like documentaries?
Mercedes is in Algeria, too
Why are you so down?
Will we get a raise?
Have things improved?
I think I'm dyslexic
Last week, we did OK
They won't let me go
Soon you'll learn the truth
Don't make me go home
I'm dyslexic, I think
It's going to hurt us
It's going to kill us
Is that really allowed?
Why's he always like that?
It's his shtick.
Please don't start now
Please don't start yet
He's an Algerian grain trader
He's an Algerian store owner
Does Algeria export meat?
Is this bike made in Algeria?
Let's call your parents
It's harvest season in Algeria
The race starts at 2:30
Will we receive a raise?
I can't go back to sleep
That's transphobic
I can't do without his help
It's going to cost a lot
It's starting to pay off
Let's go over this again
What could it be?
What could it be?
The event starts at 2:30
We're starting from zero
You won't go home hungry
That deal didn't work out
That isn't the point here
That's basically my point
That's starting to change
That's starting to happen
This shirt doesn't fit me
I see what's going on here
Do you think you can come?
Do you know who gave Tom that?
Overall, it's a good start
Tom was about 10 minutes late
Tom says he'll text you later
Tom doesn't open up to anyone

Well, it's a start I guess
Don't let go
Can we pray together?
I hate Algiers' traffic jams
He's parking attendant
I can't see what's going on
I don't know where we'll go
Tom wouldn't open his door

Not one dinar.
It means the person is a liar.
Let's get out of here!
That's going to explode!
This is phenomenal, isn't it?
This time I'm going with you
What should be our next step?
Are you afraid of being fired?
Do you believe in rebirth?
Do you still have the receipt?
How about we go to the movies?
When did Tom buy his home?
We don't want no excuses
You're important to me
We'd better get started today
You really hate me, don't you?
You've got to keep doing this
Now I see what's going on here
Why Tom and not me?
You can't go there by yourself
Tom's behavior worries me
Tom wouldn't go to bed
What time do you get home?
When do you get home?
Tom is upset, too
It's pouring
To hell with their objections!
How do fish spend the winter?
Of course not.
How sweet.
Are they happy?
It's pouring outside
It's sprinkling
It's sprinkling outside
Tom couldn't wait
Is he happy?
Is she happy?
I think I'm ready to go
I think that I'm ready to go
No one's going to hit me
Nobody's going to hit me
No one's going to hit you
Nobody's going to hit you
No one's going to kiss you
Nobody's going to kiss you
I think I'm going deaf
I think that I'm going deaf
That isn't going happen
No one's going anywhere
Keep going, Tom
It's a team effort
They've gone away
You're presumptuous
I'm going to keep it
Let's not go that far
Tom can't keep time
Tom loves Maria, but not me
It's going to work out
That's not how it went
That's what went wrong
That's why we're going
Tom is my go-to guy
There's lots going on
Ifri" is Berber for cave
It's going be expensive
It's going to be a mess

I'll always feel Algerian
He's an Algerian philosopher
That's a long way to go

It's going to be a blast
It's my job to go get it
That's a lot to wish for
That's as far as I'll go
We're going to be a team
Tom gripped Mary's hand
We're going to make wine
Tom doesn't wear pajamas
Let's see how things go
Tom weighs about 60 kilos
Pick that up and let's go
I'd prefer to go on Monday
There's not much going on
Why are you in Algeria?
You shouldn't go up there
Tom doesn't live around here
Grab your bag and let's go
If you have to go, it's OK
You're probably going deaf
Tom doesn't live in this area
It's never going to go away
Can you have this translated?
He's constantly on the phone
What are your issues with Tom?
It's time to pack up and go
Don't confide in Tom
He's an Algerian farm manager
That's all I'm going to get
That's just the way it goes
What attracts you to Tom?
Tom was born on February 29th
This isn't going to go away
Don't let things go to pieces
I'm not sure how I can go on
You've just got to let it go
It's going to be a close game
You can't let those people go
You don't want to go up there
I think we're going to make it
Some people won't go willingly
Tom's mom is from Canada
You'd better do that next week
You've just got to go in there
Tom can't fool me
It's getting late
Why did she do such a thing?
My coat has two-hole buttons
Skura's father is my landlord
Tom doesn't work for anyone
You've all been so nice to me
I'm sure the culprit is Tom
You'll soon learn the truth
Can you get this translated?
If you want anything, just ask
Tom should've come early
She's heated the milk
The party's already begun
The party's already started
Can you help me lay the table?
But that's another story
Can you help me set the table?
There's no water on the table
I don't like that kind of joke
It's good that you came
Who could know that?
It's good you came
Who might know that?
She's planning to get divorced
It won't likely snow today
It's not likely to snow today
I doubt if it'll snow today
The moon hasn't risen yet
The moon hasn't come up yet
What's "owl" in Greek?
I doubt that it'll snow today
I doubt it'll snow today
Bit by bit, she recovered
Could you have known that?
How long are you staying?
A month.
What's he going to talk about?
I laughed, but no one else did
I laughed, but nobody else did
Everyone laughed, including me
I hope Tom won't laugh at me
I thought I'd die
I thought that I'd die
I wasn't laughing
Don't tell him that I was here
She's showing off
I'm not welcome at home
You'd better not laugh
It won't likely rain today
Why are you still laughing?
I doubt if it'll rain today
I'd never be able to do that
I didn't see anybody go inside
I didn't think I could do that
We don't need to hire anybody
I swear that I'll wait for you
I guess that we're out of luck
I felt the timing wasn't right
I'm glad that you weren't hurt
That's not a hard thing to do
That's not an easy thing to do
That isn't an easy thing to do
I'm drinking beer
I'm the only one who laughed
It's not likely to rain today
It isn't likely to rain today
I'm much younger than Tom is
“I was very worried.”
Tom didn't follow the recipe
Tom hasn't met Mary's kids yet
I'm not as optimistic as you
I can't do much
I can't pay you now
I can't go there now
I don't have money now
Can we keep it a secret?
Can I stay here with you?
Tom couldn't help but agree
Will you accept this job?
I've decided to do that myself
Why are you still standing?
What an unfortunate situation!
Don't tell me what to do
I'm afraid of being laughed at
I've got a favor to ask of you
The point is Tom wasn't lying
I don't have any French books
Tom didn't say anything new
Tom and I weren't laughing
You're foreigners
Is Tom still bothering you?
I've never heard Tom laugh
He's an Algerian marine pilot
We shouldn't laugh at Tom
Tom didn't look sad to me
Does Algeria have rare earths?
I'm learning Ladino
I'm learning Judeo-Spanish
That happened to Tom, too
You're a foreigner
Tom didn't bat an eyelid
I waited for Tom's reply
We didn't hear anything
I can't tell Dad about this
Damn, you're such a mug
Tom didn't look sad
I missed Tom's call
Tom didn't vote
This isn't so rare
Tom likes math, but I don't
This isn't so uncommon
Tom is known as a ladies' man
I didn't study Berber formerly
Over time, he learned Berber
After all, he's Algerian
Algeria has won 4-1
Ghana lost to Algeria 4-1
That's forbidden in Algeria
How did the presentation go?
He's an Algerian traffic cop
Talwit" means peace in Berber
He's an Algerian office worker
Algerians' tastes are changing
I've always told you the truth
I can't hear you
Do I need you?
There's a kitten on our porch
Will you try it?
I won't likely win
I won't need those
I won't be forgiven
Why are you still up?
I didn't find it easy
Cats are baby-sized
Cats are baby-sized furballs
Let's blow the fans
I won't buy any of these
Please don't wait for me
He's an Algerian goldsmith
Are the fish biting today?
I won't help you tomorrow
What's in the dog's mouth?
I can't get the door locked
Let's check more thoroughly
Aren't I beautiful?
Am I really ugly?
Tom's arm hurts
It won't be repeated again
Can you find Tom?
Did we scare Tom?
Do you wear a wedding ring?
Can anyone guess?
She's as thin as a rake
It's a very important question
They've bought a newspaper
They've got used to the cold
Is this book worth reading?
Yes, it is.
Yes, an orange juice, please.
Let's get home sharpish
Let's get home, quickly
Utter vapor, said Kohelet
Utter vapor, all is vapor
Did you live in Algeria?
Why did you return to Algeria?
Do you like Jill's new hairdo?
Why did you return to Algeria?
To save my country.
To save my country.
Do you remember that time?
He's an Algerian engineer
Today is Wednesday, isn't it?
Today's Wednesday, innit?
He introduced his fiancée
How fast will Algeria grow?
Who's Tom dating?
Maybe Tom's answer will be no
Should we ask Tom?
Don't be like this
Tom won't keep it
Why did Tom shoot?
Can't you find Tom?
Did you tickle Tom?
My door won't lock
Tom's bag is empty
Who's visiting Tom?
You can't beat Tom
Tom won't wear that
I bet Tom won't come
Do you mind taking me home?
Should we praise Tom?
Tom didn't want this
I don't know who anybody is
I don't know who anyone is
Don't turn on the light
Don't turn the light on
I don't think that can happen
Everyones's scores went up
Everybody's scores went up
I'm sure Tom won't let us down
I hope Tom doesn't let us down
I'm sure this was done by Tom
I'm sure Tom did this
I'm sure that Tom did this
I'm hungrier than Tom is
I hope that won't be a problem
I hope I don't bore you
I hope that I don't bore you
Why is everyone awake?
Why is everybody awake?
Don't be afraid, Tom
It doesn't look so cute
What is the joy of life?
Don't call us
Don't end up like Tom
Don't be tardy
Don't ask me what Tom meant
Don't betray me
Don't let Tom get away with it
Don't stop trying
Don't mess them up
Don't you feel hot?
Don't dye your hair
Don't spill the milk
Don't tell my father
Don't ask me for help
Don't be hypocritical
Don't bother Tom now
He's studying
Don't do it right now
Don't give up hope yet
Don't hate me for this
Don't quote me on that
Don't try to remind me
Don't be fooled by that
Where is the evidence, Billy?
We need the evidence!

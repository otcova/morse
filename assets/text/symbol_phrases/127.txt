You're safer here
You're really funny
You're quite the liar
You're quite a liar
You're pathetic
You're overreacting
You're out of excuses
You're on your own
You're not looking so hot
You're not helping
You're not alone
You're my son
You're my hero
You're my friend
You're lying to me
You're lucky Tom helped you
You're lucky Tom didn't come
You're late
You're kidding me
You're just jealous
You're insane
You're in trouble
You're home early
You're here early
You're going to love this book
You're going to like Tom
You're going to have to leave
You're funny
You're drunk
You're driving me crazy
You're dreaming
You're doing fine
You're disgusting
You're braver than me
You're braver than I am
You're bluffing
You're biased
You're babbling
You're annoying
You're acting like a child
You're acting like a baby
You're a snob
You're a prude
You're a liar
You're a good man
You're a good friend
You're a good father
You'll be fine
You'd better take this
You'd better hand that over
You won't remember a thing
You won't find anything here
You won't be needing that
You shouldn't have come back
You shouldn't have come alone
You shouldn't be in here
You shouldn't be doing that
You should've listened to me
You should see Tom's picture
However, I think it's pork
You never know who's watching
You must be Tom's mother
You know we'd never hurt you
You know I'm telling the truth
You just don't get it
You don't sound happy
You don't scare me
You don't really know me
You don't owe me anything
You don't need that
You don't look so good
You don't know Tom like I do
You don't know me
You don't have to thank me
You don't have to be sarcastic
You don't have a choice
You didn't prepare me for this
You didn't let me finish
You didn't call me
You can't use that
You can't mean that
You can't just leave
You can't hurt me
You can't help them
You can't force Tom to do that
You can't force me to do this
You can't do this
You can't come in here
Achoo.
Bless you.
Thanks.
I'm still job hunting
But it's true!
She's a pedicurist
It can't possibly be true
It's really delicious
It didn't work
It was Tom's idea
It wasn't Tom who betrayed us
It wasn't Tom who kissed Mary
It wasn't very good
It won't matter
It won't take long
It'll be our secret
That didn't take long
That didn't work
That doesn't mean anything
That isn't my problem
That isn't what I meant
That wasn't funny
That wasn't my mistake
That wasn't so hard
That wasn't your job
That won't happen again
That's a joke
That's a myth
That's a plan
That's an even better idea
That's an excellent choice
That's an old joke
That's cool
That's correct
That's embarrassing
That's fantastic
That's for you
That's funny
That's going to take some time
That's hilarious
That's how I would do it
That's interesting
That's more than enough
That's my doll
That's my job
That's not all Tom said
That's not an option
That's not bad
That's not even funny
That's not going to help
That's not good
That's not in the file
That's not my fault
That's not my name
That's not nice
That's not Tom's fault
That's not what I want
That's not what I'm saying
That's not what Tom meant
That's not why I did it
That's perfect
That's plenty
That's so freaky
That's so great
That's so lame
That's so sweet
That's stupid
That's the one
That's too personal
That's unacceptable
That's very cool
That's what friends are for
That's what I want
That's what Tom said
That's wonderful
That's your job
That's your problem
Why don't you look for a job?
Why is this happening?
There's no danger
How does he know that?
How does she know that?
Sound the alarm!
It's easy to remember
Where's Tom from?
What a perfect night!
This one's yours
This one's Tom's
This isn't possible
This isn't funny
This isn't for you
This isn't as hard as it looks
This isn't as easy as it looks
This isn't a party
This isn't a joke
This doesn't make sense
They've had plenty of time
They're with me
They're stalling
They're not a threat
They're lying
They're gone
They're expensive
They're cool
They're coming
They're armed
They're all scared of Tom
They'll take care of Tom
They won't tell us anything
They haven't hurt me
There's still time
There's no need to be gentle
There's no blood on the floor
There's a call for you
It's Tom
The gun isn't loaded
Something's wrong
Someone's outside
Someone's in the shower
Someone's in the next room
Please tell me you're OK
Please don't shoot
Please don't hate me
Please don't go
Please don't fight
Please don't do this
Please don't do that
Perhaps you're right
Now it's my turn
My life isn't worth living
Mary isn't my sister
How interesting!
That's not fair
Everything's ready
Everything's gone
Everything's going to be fine
Everyone's watching Tom
Everyone's very excited
Everyone's shocked
Everyone's looking at Tom
Everyone's having a great time
Everyone's asleep
Everybody's crying
Do you think Tom will come?
Do whatever's required
Let's go home
Let's get out of here
I'm taking you home
A sane man wouldn't do that
Let's share the money
We'll talk about it tomorrow
We'll do it tomorrow
My friend doesn't play tennis
Don't take it too literally
I don't know what happens here
I don't feel up to it
Did you collect them all?
It's as easy as that!
When did you come?
Do geese see God?
He's as beautiful as the sun
It's a miracle!
It's a miracle!
It moved!
I think it's the wind.
How will I pay my debts now?
How will we pay our debts now?
How will she pay her debts?
How will he pay his debts?
How will you pay your debts?
Why did it take so long?
Yes, he is angry
Yes, she is angry
She's so young
He's so young
How will I pay my debts?
How will we pay our debts?
You don't need to wait
I'm tired of waiting in line
You won't have your way
They've come to make trouble
He's come to make trouble
She's come to make trouble
Wait a minute, honey!
Wait a minute, Tom!
Wait a minute, Mary!
Don't show your cards
We'll starve to death!
I'll starve to death!
He's a slob
She's a slob
I'm a slob
Don't believe anything he says
I'm using an expensive watch
I didn't do anything illegal
Can I go out to play?
There's no drinkable water
She's not my sister
What on earth is this?
It's deeply embarrassing
I didn't know it at the time
I didn't know her at the time
I didn't know him at the time
I didn't know that at the time
I didn't know Tom at that time
Heavens to Betsy!
I've rarely seen you so quiet
I've rarely seen him so quiet
I've rarely seen her so quiet
I've rarely seen Tom so quiet
Don't help a woman in public
You'll look suspicious
It's not for sale
Do you trust him?
Do you trust Tom?
I'm not for sale
Where can I find her?
I'm not a whore
He's the perfect man for you
He's the perfect man for him
He's the perfect man for her
He's the perfect man for me
She's the perfect girl for him
She's the perfect girl for you
I don't want to get out of bed
Tom has a mid-Atlantic accent
You don't have any proof
He doesn't have any proof
She doesn't have any proof
It's all I have
How many boys do you have?
I only have one.
How many girls do you have?
I only have one.
How many children do you have?
I only have one.
I'm bad at swimming
Don't do two things at once
We survived!
We didn't get paid this week
This is my friend's letter
I wish summer would never end!
My new baby arrived!
Thanks, hon
Thanks, honey
Is anyone looking?
Is he looking?
Is she looking?
Are you looking?
She's a looker
She's a hooker
It's cold this morning
Have you already finished?
Coffee, please
Let's go tomorrow afternoon
I'm too poor to marry her
The fisherman's story is fishy
I've never heard her complain
What a prick!
What are they looking for?
It's an inside job
Is this how you repay me?
How can I ever repay you?
I'm talking to you!
I can't eat this
I can't wait to eat it
I can't wait to eat the cake
I can't eat pork
Tom can't eat pork
Do cats dream?
He's greedy and lazy
You're a fucking genius
Sometimes, labels are useful
They're in the hot tub
Do you have a crush on Tom?
Do you have a crush on Mary?
Do you have a crush on him?
Do you have a crush on her?
Tom, what are you doing?
Mary, what are you doing?
Stop hitting me!
Mom, Tom's hitting me!
Mom, Mary's hitting me!
Stop hitting the cat!
Stop teasing your sister!
Stop teasing your brother!
Stop it right now!
Stop yelling!
Go to your room!
How was school today?
I can't wait
I can't wait to see you
It's a nice day today
What was I saying?
He'll be here real soon
I can't think straight
He'll be here very soon
Yes, you're hot
Have you told her mother?
Have you told his mother?
Have you told Tom's mother?
Have you told Tom?
It's rather impressive
Promise me you won't tell her
Promise me you won't tell him
Promise me you won't tell Tom
Promise me you won't tell Mom
I sat down next to Tom.
I don't believe you.
Good night, sweetheart
Let's toss a coin
Let's flip a coin
As if I didn't know that!
Bill, tell us a story
Is it new?
She doesn't have a ticket
He doesn't have a ticket
That's already quite good
It's already good
I just can't
I'll let you know
When will you be here?
I'll let you know.
That's an order
Guess who's coming for dinner
Who's coming for dinner?
She's never satisfied
He's never satisfied
Empty your pockets!
Put your hands up in the air!
She's after me
She's not my type
You're not my type
Can I sleep here?
I'm not available
She's not available
He's not available
I'm a bit drunk
He's a bit drunk
She's a bit drunk
He's a bit tipsy
She's a bit tipsy
I'm a bit tipsy
It makes perfect sense!
She can't stop talking
Here, look at this
Here, take this
It doesn't fit well here
I'm having trouble focusing
I don't know where to begin
Don't leave me alone!
She's cruel
He's cruel
He hasn't done anything
She hasn't done anything
I'll call the chef
What do you expect to happen?
What did you expect to happen?
We have a lot of things do to.
Such as?
It's hot today.
Sure is.
He's very lonely
She's very lonely
I'm from the East Coast
I'm from the West Coast
He's sweet, fun and talented
He's manly and strong
It's fun and exciting
He had a near-death experience
She's already married
He's already married

What kind of beer do you want?
Whatever's on tap.
What kind of beer do you want?
What do you have on tap?
If only I'd done my homework!
If I'd only taken your advice!
I see son's mother
He can't whistle
How do you pronounce his name?
How do you pronounce her name?
How often do you shower?
How arrogant!
Could be, could be
It's such a beautiful flower
Says who?
Says me.
I'm ashamed of what I did
I'm not ashamed of who I am
I'm not ashamed of what I did
I'm not ashamed
He's a cheat and a liar
You're a wonderful friend
What do I get in return?
He's after me
I don't remember anything
She doesn't remember anything
He doesn't remember anything
Do you see the portrait?
Can we believe that?
Can we believe in that?
A dog's nose is very sensitive
I can't read her poker face
It's no secret
I am very happy", he said
I've sent it by Post
I'm fine, thanks!
Let's finish the job
It's never too late to start
He's stupid and dishonest
She's stupid, but honest
Where do we come from?
Who are we?
Where are we going?
She's a fanatic
He's a fanatic
I've got them all
Do you want to see more?
Keep your voice down!
You write like a panty!
Do you wear glasses?
Oh, Tom, take me with you!
Stop dating losers!
Would you like to see her?
Would you like to see Tom?
Would you like to see it?
Would you like to see them?
Do you think he will like it?
Do you think she will like it?
Are things going well?
It's moist and warm
What else do you have?
Do you like it then?
Something's not right here
When can I see you again?
Get off my back!
I've been dying to see her
I've been dying to see him
I've been dying to see you
I'm dying to see her
I'm dying to see him
Why do you put up with that?
I can't confirm this
I'm sure things will work out
Do I look fat?
She's a bigot
He's a bigot
He doesn't have his medication
Are you from around here?
What do you have to lose?
It's lunchtime!
It's not why I'm here
I don't drink
He doesn't drink
She doesn't drink
Did you know him well?
Did you know her well?
Don't throw bones to the dog!
Could you show me how?
Who will understand the loss?
Show me how to do that!
'Is that vodka?'
That is pure spirit!'
I believe she's 40 years old
Why did you buy a new laptop?
I couldn't resist!
I couldn't resist
He couldn't resist
She couldn't resist
Tom, I want to go to sleep
She's writing her diary
He's writing his diary
Do you disagree?
He's going bald
I'm going bald
Have you been drinking?
I don't think they're married
What does it feel like?
How did it feel like?
How hard can that be?
Thank you, my dear
What have we done?
When are we going to do it?
I'm not blushing!
You're blushing!
No, I'm not.
I can't
It's too big
I can't reformat my harddrive
It's too big
No, I can't
It's too big!
No, I can't clean your house
It's too big!
Don't worry
I'll teach you how to drive
I'm so tired
Man is mortal.
That's my opinion
I'm old
Are you a registered voter?
It's your civic duty to vote
Tom says he won't vote
Does anyone know Japanese?
Hello, Honey
Does anyone speak Japanese?
What do you want then?
Hello, have you already eaten?
Will you be here tomorrow?
I want to be alone!
I reckon that I'm right
It's as old as the hills
It's as old as the world
She didn't get the joke
That's why I share this news
Sun and rain, rainbow
I'm a sculpture
Better leave it!
What is your advice?
I don't feel like it anyway!
Are you gonna pay for it?
It's a deadly poison!
Doctor, it's the wrong leg!
Where are you parents?
What happened to your husband?
They're all dead!
All dead!
All dead!
Alert!
Throw him in the water!
What!
Holk had a son?
God!
What a beard you have!
You look terrible!
It's arsenic!
Quick!
Quick!
I hear footsteps, hide!
What happened to you?
Is it so difficult to write?
It's annoying
That's annoying
Is this annoying?
Am I annoying you?
That's pretty annoying
That's an annoying habit
Do you find that annoying?
I'm not annoying anyone, am I?
It doesn't annoy me
It doesn't bother me
What an idiot!
Mary! poor Mary!
You're starting to annoy me
You're really on time
It’s just midnight
It's all in your imagination
It's so annoying!
Seize this brigand!
Prevent him from escaping!
Don't mention the war!
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Does your father know?
Does your mother know?
What time is your train?
What time is your plane?
What time is your bus?
Well, that was quick!
We only use 10% of our brain
How could it be?
How can it be?
How long has he been dead?
How bad can it be?
It's simpler and more reliable
Tom will be here soon.
How soon?
Will you buy it for me?
Buy what?
Everybody is invited.
Even Tom?
Please go there now.
Go where?
Did she say something?
Did he say something?
Why did Tom do that?
Beats me.
Why did Tom do that?
I have no idea.
Why did Tom do that?
I don't know.
Why did Tom do that?
Do what?
She's intelligent and sexy
He's sexy and intelligent
Do you want to look at it?
Does he want to look at it?
Does she want to look at it?
He's going to cross the river
I can't take this any longer
He couldn't take it any longer
You can't go in there!
I can't take it any longer
He's a southpaw
Sadly, Tom doesn't read books
Don't mess with me!
Don't mess with me, Tom!
You're such a liar
He's no saint
She's no saint
I'm no saint
Yes, just a little bit.
I appreciate all you've done
You're white as a ghost
Are you sick?
Mary is left-handed
I'm coming back next week
Look!
The cat's in the kitchen
I've been trying to find Tom
No...
It's my birthday!
It's our wedding anniversary!
I forgot my wife's birthday
Tom forgot his wife's birthday
He forgot his wife's birthday
I forgot my own birthday!
Come down here!
He's a grumpy old man
I owe you nothing!
Am I right?
I'd just like to talk
I don't owe him anything
I'll teach you some manners!
I'm not through with you!
Don't speak to me like that!
What's wrong with my manners?
Will I see you later?
Isn't she a knockout?
She's a knockout
Why didn't you tell me before?
I'm a police officer
He's a police officer
She's a police officer
He's dark and handsome
I'd just like to be ignored
He looks like your father.
What?
Look at this!
He's always clowning in class
That's not very polite
We haven't got all day
I haven't got all day
She's a babe
He's interested in you
She's interested in you
I think he's interested in you
I think he's interested in me
I think she's interested in me
She's not my girlfriend
She's not my girlfriend
She's my sister
He's not my boyfriend
He's not my boyfriend
He's my brother
Did you get the message?
Did you get a massage?
Do you want a massage?
They're crazy about each other
Are you coughing blood?
That's not good
Don't give me any ideas
It's very nice of you
She's obviously in pain
He's obviously in pain
I'm in trouble
She's in trouble
He's in trouble
What are you talking about?
It's our wedding anniversary!
I'm not your girlfriend
I'm not your slave
It's well worth the cost
It's well worth the trouble
Don't look at this!
Don't look at me!
Don't look at him!
Don't look at her!
It's getting dark
It's fun and healthy
It's a rough neighborhood
Don't say such things
There's no hope
There isn't any hope
Is it already five o'clock?!
How time flies!

Do you want wine?
Do you want some wine?
How goes it, Jacques?
Your papers, travellers!
That's the sentence
Don't you be afraid of that.
Silence in the court!
That's a great start!
What do all have in common?
Are you happy with that?
I think that's great!
Is this a gift for me?
Open that thing!
What is it now?
You got those from a field?
Look at that!
He's started writing a novel
He's so full of shit
You're full of shit

I thought we'd be safe here
I thought I'd never hear that
I thought I'd surprise you
I thought I'd always be alone
Let's dance together.
I thought you'd never ask.
I thought you'd gone home
I thought you'd been killed
I'm glad I was wrong
That's my friend Rachel
He's mad at his daughter
She's a real hottie
I thought Tom wouldn't give up
I thought you wouldn't give up
I thought Tom wouldn't come
I thought they wouldn't come
I don't like him very much
Dance with me.

He who drinks, will drink
He's a devout Catholic
She's a devout Catholic
I've got to speak to you

It's not fun
It's not funny anymore
You're hurting me
I'm bleeding
There's a red light
I don't want to
Stop!
You're tickling me!
Stop!
You're hurting him!
Stop!
You're the designated driver
Stop, you're breaking my heart

I don't know.
Do you think she's okay?
I don't know.
I haven't slept in days
What were you doing together?
You're making this up
You're making this up.
No, I'm not.
You just realized that?
There's no one in the garden
I only have 10 books
I have only 10 books
You're white as a sheet
Why's that red light blinking?
Why do you look so pale?
Where's your black suit?
Where's my lucky blue cap?
What's this purple stain?
What's this green stuff?
What's that red stuff?
What are these blue things?

There's a nice blue sky today
That's my favorite blue shirt

My hair's turned gray

It's a red herring
I'll have a white wine, please
Does this look pink to you?
Do you like red licorice?
Could I borrow your gray suit?
Are my ears red?
He's very protective of him
He's very protective of her
She's very protective of him
She's very protective of her
The combination is 10-42-30
I'm freezing cold
It's time to go home now
You'll never get it
You'll never get in that club
You'll have to ask Tom
You'll get your turn
You'll get your shot
You'll get your money
You'll get a copy
You'd better get up
Thanks Tom, I appreciate it
You won't like Tom
You get the idea, don't you?

It's genuine
It's awkward
I've tried to talk to Tom
I've been trying to avoid Tom
I'm too busy to see Tom

Millie isn't drinking water
Here's the truth
Tell us the truth, Tom
I've told you the truth
Tom must've told us the truth
You can't go there
We'll find the truth
Don't tell them the truth, OK?
I love you, Millie!
She'll pass the exam for sure
That won't change a thing
I'm looking around
Why is French so difficult?
I'm reading my book
I'm going on a trip
You can't see him
You can't see it
You can't see her
Tom's face was wet with tears
Did the cat get your tongue?
Has the cat got your tongue?
Why would Tom have done that?
What's keeping you?
What kept you up last night?
We've got to keep moving
Let's keep this simple
Could you keep it down?
Can we keep it?
I'll call you back in an hour
May I try it?
He probably can't forget her
I can't stand this any longer
We're disappointed
They're getting ready
Look, there's my mom
Look, there's my mother
Do I need to do it again?
Keep out of Tom's way
How do you keep so calm?
Could you keep an eye on Tom?
I'm sorry I kept you waiting
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
She doesn't have many books
It's already time for us to go
He's going to Paris next month
How much is this?
Men's clothing isn't pretty
Millie isn't eating an apple
You don't have brown eyes
He doesn't have a gun
Does she have a new computer?
That's the only way
She's their only daughter
Why's Tom being mean to Mary?
Tom's mean, isn't he?
Tom isn't very mean
Tom gets mean when he's drunk
What does this all mean?
What did you mean by that?
What could Tom mean?
Tom didn't mean what he said
I didn't mean to offend Tom
I didn't mean to make Tom cry
I didn't mean to hit Tom
Do you mean you don't know?
Did you mean that?
Were you born here?
Tom's intentions were unclear
It's the only way to find out
I'm sick of talking about it
I know what you've been up to
It's very pretty
In truth, this has no gravity
This, really, isn't important
Where is your mother?
Not true?
You're not sleeping enough
You'd better get some sleep
Where's Tom sleeping tonight?
Where am I supposed to sleep?
Where am I going to sleep?
Were you able to sleep at all?
Tom's bed hasn't been slept in
Tom looks like he's sleeping
Now let's get some sleep
It's too noisy to sleep
It's too bright to sleep
If you need to sleep, go ahead
I'm still half asleep
I'll sleep on the couch
I couldn't fall back to sleep
How long did I sleep?
How did you sleep?
Get a good night's sleep
Do you ever sleep?
Did you sleep OK?
Did you sleep in here?
Did you sleep here?
Did you sleep here last night?
Did you sleep at all?
Did you sleep all right?
Did you get any sleep at all?
Can Tom sleep in my room?
Can I sleep on your couch?
Are you getting enough sleep?
Cease fire!
You must've been dreaming

You must think I'm stupid
You probably think I'm stupid
You must think I'm crazy
You probably think I'm crazy
You must think I'm an idiot
You must think I'm a creep
You probably think I'm a creep
You shouldn't stay here
You miss Tom a lot, don't you?
You miss it, don't you?
You have a big family, right?
What must we do?
What do we need to do?
What do we have to do?
What must I do?
What do I need to do?
We must've made a mistake
We've probably made a mistake
We've likely made a mistake
We must've been followed
We shouldn't stay here
We shouldn't lose hope
We must've blown a fuse
We've probably blown a fuse
Tom must've gone out
This is yours, isn't it?
This is for you, I think
These are yours, right?
There must've been a mistake
That's why we must leave
That's why we have to leave
That's why we need to leave
That's why we must fight
That's why we have to fight
That's why we need to fight
That must've been hard
That must've been fun
That must've been difficult
That must be Tom's girlfriend
That's likely Tom's girlfriend
That's probably a new record
That's likely a new record
That's probably a mistake
That's likely a mistake
That's probably a misprint
That's likely a misprint
Must you do this every time?
It must've slipped my mind
It must've been Tom
It must've been stolen
It must've been quick
It must've been awful
It must've been fun
It's probably the flu
It's probably past midnight
It's probably hard
It's probably bad
It's probably a warning
I think it's a warning
It's probably a virus
It's probably a sign
It's probably a mistake
It's likely a mistake
It's probably a big list
I must've sat on it
I must've been dreaming
We didn't come
It's midday
We're a bit early, aren't we?
Well, sort of
Now, intruder detected!
You're in math class

What's the use of talking?
What's left to talk about?
What should we talk about?
We're talking to you, Tom
We'll talk in the morning
We'll talk business later
We'll need to talk to Tom
Tom won't talk about that
Listen, we've got to talk

Tom doesn't talk to us anymore
Tom can't wait to talk to Mary
Right now, I feel like talking
It wasn't Tom who talked to me
I don't know who Tom talked to
Don't talk about Tom like that
Wake up, Tom
I've got to talk to you
Could you excuse us?
I can't talk to you here
What's wrong, Tom?
I'm sorry
I reflected on what I did.
Reflected on what you did?
Sorry, what was your name?
I'm sorry
Did I wake you up?
I'm not denying it.
Should I help you?
Speak up, Tom

Why the heck did you do this?
Do you want a little company?
I've enjoyed your company
We've got company again
I've got company
It's a big company
This isn't a very good company
What are we laughing at?
Tom didn't laugh, did he?
Tom didn't laugh at my joke
Tom seldom, if ever, laughs
How did you get Tom to laugh?
Tom made you laugh, didn't he?
Everything's all right now
It's all right, Tom
Everything's all right now
It's not what you're thinking
Tom thinks I'm jealous
Tom thinks I'm a loser
Do you think it was Tom?
Do you think Tom's right?
Do you think Tom did this?
I think it's crazy

You know what I think, right?
Do you think Tom is in Boston?
It's almost midnight
Where is the bar?
Where is the beach?
I think we're lost
I think we're next
I think I'm in danger
I think Tom's an idiot
That's a scary thought
I know what Tom's thinking
I think Tom is open-minded
I think Tom is good-looking
I think Tom is hard-working
I think Tom is self-centered
That's all Tom thinks about
Tom doesn't think it's true
Tom thinks it's a good idea
What does Tom think of this?
Does Tom think Mary is pretty?
What do you think so far?
I don't think I can fix it
Tom thinks I'm still a kid
Does Tom think he can do it?
I think Tom is narrow-minded
Tom said he'd think about it
Tom thinks it's a great idea
Tom thought I'd let him down
Do they think Tom kissed Mary?
Tom says he'll think about it
Why do you think Tom hates me?
It's not as easy as Tom thinks
He's a little rebel
I'm sorry to hear this
How can I like this?
Who could like this?
Can I stay here?
Can I stay over?
I'm not staying
I'm staying put
Maybe I'll stay
I'm staying here
Can you stay long?
I knew you'd stay
I should've stayed
I won't be staying
Let's stay married
We're here to stay
Can I stay and help?
Do you wish to stay?
Is Tom staying here?
Stay out of it, Tom
Stay right here, OK?
Tom can't stay here
We'll stay with Tom
You'll stay with me
Are you back to stay?
I'll stay right here
Stay in here, please
They'll stay with me
We'll stay and fight
Where are we staying?
Why do you stay here?
Can you stay a minute?
Can you stay with Tom?
How long can Tom stay?
How long can you stay?
How long did Tom stay?
Let's stay in tonight
Stay right there, Tom
Try to stay cool, Tom
You'll stay here, Tom
Can't you stay with me?
I've asked Tom to stay
If you stay, I'll stay
We're not staying here
We're staying with you
You'd better stay here
Are you staying in town?
Could you stay a minute?
I can't stay any longer
I can't stay mad at you
I'll stay away from you
Stay out of my way, Tom
Stay out of trouble, OK?
Tom can't stay for long
Tom isn't going to stay
We've got to stay alert
We've got to stay awake
Why can't I stay with you?
Why can't Tom stay here?
You can't stay here now
You promised you'd stay

Tom's very kind
Tom's really kind
Is Tom able to do this?
It wasn't such a big deal
You aren't answering me
That's a moot point for now
It's still a big deal
You're not answering me
He's mostly to blame
He's mostly at fault
She's the same age as I do
Why are you displeased?
That isn't part of our plan
I'll tell Tom to do it
Even Tom can't do this
Tom?
Can you hear me?
Tom, can you hear me?
I'm not deaf.
It's OK to change the plan
Throw it to me!
Did this medication help you?
I think that'll be fun
I'd ask Tom to do this
Do you have a family doctor?
Why is that so small?
Now isn't the time to do this
It'll be like that
That's how it'll be
It's a good time to buy
Why don't I remember anything?
You didn't need to see that
I can, but I won't
I would, but I can't
I'd do it, but I can't
I can do it, but I won't
I want to do it, but I can't
I could do that, but I won't
You don't know French, do you?
Maybe Tom didn't do it
Why won't you leave Tom alone?
Has Tom ever done this?
Has Tom ever done this before?
I won't help Tom do it
That strategy didn't pay off
This food won't last us a week
That's an excellent plan
Yanni's life is unbearable
Yanni's house began to burn
The gift isn't from Yanni
Yanni's life was falling apart
We don't have time to play
Would you sit with Tom?
That's why we love Tom so much
He's my husband's father
He's my father-in-law
That wasn't the actual plan
Don't ask me what that means
I'm a seismologist
I can't take jokes anymore
We'll never know what happened
I'm Mary, Tom's aunt
Did Tom actually buy these?
I promised Tom we'd help
That's how I would do that
We don't need to help Tom
I know Tom won't do it
Thank God it's almost over
I believe he's going to win
Where did they learn Romanian?
I am an electrician, ain't I?
I'm indebted to them
That's why we need your help
Are they Portuguese?
Yes, they are.
Why can't I sit here?
What is this the year of?
Luckily, nobody was injured
Let's see this plan of yours
The pay still isn't very good
You can't let that affect you
It's a great place to live
I'm Mary, Tom's grandmother
I know Tom can't do it
I'd like to sit with Tom
Your life won't be easy
That's how we all feel
I wasn't in the city
I've seen how smart you are
I'm scared to tell him
I can't see anything
Shoot!
Do they believe in us?
That's a big part of what I do
I'm Mary, Tom's mother
I love to party!
We don't need help right now
My heater isn't working
Tom can't handle the stress
It's not really a big deal
You can't brake on snow
I'll be your tour guide
Where does Tom sleep?
Where will Tom sleep?
Where will Tom be sleeping?
They'd rather stay
Here, let me take care of that
I don't think anyone will come
I don't want to work anymore
What's the science behind it?
Where's the voting booth?
We may need Tom's help someday
Do you have a double bed?
Don't turn your nose up at me
We may want Tom's help someday
Should I sit in the front?
It's not a done deal yet
Who let Tom do that?
I don't have what he needs
May I take more coffee?
Take it back!
Why are they there?
Today is my sister's wedding
Why haven't you boarded yet?
I'm sleeping very poorly
I'm sleeping very well
Could you come here?
I don't believe that rumor
Do you still need me here?
I don't want that in my life
Who let you use my computer?
When will we go to the beach?
Where's the other one?
We don't have anything for you
I can't find the other one
They're at the beach
Children don't have to work
Was your hands, please!
I'm busy now
Let's talk about this later
I still don't know how to cook
She's not listening to me!
We're doing well, thank you
Did anybody get shot?
We can't leave it up to chance
Mary has three ex-husbands
Could someone let the dog out?
Could someone let the dog in?
I didn't let it faze me
You've got to read this book
What was Tom pointing at?
Let's see what we've got here
Step out of the way!
Don't point at me
I'll be back at sunset
No one thinks that'll happen
This doesn't seem right to me
That's the point of the story
Let's give them a hand
I'm not a good loser
Stop being so cute!
There's no need to leave yet
How hard is it to learn Tamil?
Can you learn Konkani online?
Who cleared the snow?
2021 is the Year of the Buffel
2021 is the year of Tom
Look, let me try this again
You shouldn't go there
You shouldn't be going
Does he play?
Don't become old
It's not good to be old
It's not much of a change
Tom's stepson's name is John
It's not an easy way to live
We'll get this done somehow
They aren't speaking to Mary
He's going to Tokyo tomorrow
The wound hasn't healed yet
It's not worth trying
Of course, I want to do it
These socks are Tom's
That's all we can ask for
Of course, I'm disappointed
Tom doesn't like sake
What is that dialect?
The teacher didn't come
Do you speak Spanish fluently?
Why is she meowing?
Tom doesn't like drinking
Tom doesn't like to drink
Who used up all the hot water?
Can I turn it in late?
Our dog isn't house broken yet
Why did this happen to Tom?
Let's not drive there
Let's walk
I don't want to drive
Could you stay here for now?
You're not young like me
You're not young like I am
You're not poor like me
You're not poor like I am
Is that still your plan?
This poetry isn't easy to read
It doesn't fit here
It's easy to make mistakes
He's not mad
We're sure we can do it
Don't be a liar
This can't end well
Has that been fact-checked?
They're going to fire me
What a fanatic!
You'd better get in bed
Me, eat seafood?
No way!
It's time to take my pills
Aren't I a person, too?
They're people too
We are the 99%
I don't want to right now
I don't work next week
Can you give me a hand?
Who will govern the country?
There's more than I thought
Don't put the chair there
I don't have a permanent job
You're not as poor as I am
We are the 99 percent
What do they all want from me?
I'm not joking at all
If Yanni wins, I'd eat my hat
Skura's mom instinct kicked in
Yanni's conscience was calling
That shouldn't happen
You look so pretty today!
Yikes, how cold it is!
Get yourself together!
I'm a lioness
Why's Tom sulking?
We'd better begin
We don't live in the same city
Yiddish isn't Hebrew
Which room does Tom sleep in?
It's too hot to do this now
It's our turn with the boys
Does he still love him?
Does he want codfish?
Does she want codfish?
Do you prefer scrambled eggs?
No, we prefer fried eggs.
Here's my report card
We are the ninety-nine percent
I'll get you some help
It isn't worth getting angry
Tom doesn't smoke at home
Who is in Mary's way?
Who's in Mary's way?
Don't listen to his lies!
Don't listen to her lies!
Where is the snack section?
Why did that happen to Tom?
Why is Tom sulking?
You've been a great help
It's just not a good deal
I'll do this later
Did anyone get shot?
Did anyone get killed?
Did anybody get killed?
If you're bored, you can leave
It's nice to meet you again
Does anybody know who that is?
Who sold that to you?
Who sold Tom his car?
Who sold you that?
Who did you buy that from?
Why on earth did you say that?
We're busier today than usual
Let's do what Tom suggested
Who told you I'd help you?
Tom isn't my boyfriend
He's a friend who's a boy
I bet he doesn't know anything
Ow, ow, ow!
Don't bite my ear!
I'm not a vegetarian anymore
I'll make you beans
It's eating me up inside
I wanted coffee, not tea
They're reading the text
Why doesn't he go back home?
Why doesn't she go back home?
I forgot my wallet!
I'm fed up with them
What is the real human nature?
Where did you learn Dutch?
No, sir, I'm Spanish
See you soon, my friend!
Have you not had dinner yet?
Are you afraid of Tom too?
Yes, that must be beer
I remember that!
Can you give me a few minutes?
Where did you learn Latin?
Do you have a vegetarian menu?
This looks like Tom's work
This shirt is 100% polyester
How will you respond?
What do you say in return?
How will they react to this?
I don't dislike it
I really don't like children
I really don't like kids
I really can't stand kids
How did you even manage that?
It's clear he abandoned us
Do you really want to quit?
I'm Swiss
Do you really want to stop?
Who is in control?
He's young and ambitious
Who is in charge?
Let Tom drive too.
In my car?
No way!
He invited all of us.
I can't ski that well
Does this have meat in it?
Does this have pork in it?
I'm headed that way right now
I'll be arriving soon
Let's end here for today
Has anyone seen my beer mug?
I wouldn't work for Tom again
Don't let it affect you
Do you really need to go?
I don't recognize that car
Why do you hate Canadians?
It's time to take my medicine
You're not as poor as me
You aren't as poor as I am
You aren't as poor as me
Who'll govern the country?
Can you learn French online?
Can you learn cooking online?
When will Tom get back?
It's cool outside
Somebody's been here
My house isn't big
My car isn't brown
Don't mix everything together
Who's the bride?
Are you Tom's wife?
I've sold my old guitar
My car isn't yellow
This isn't worth much
This isn't worth much money
Do you have a band-aid?
I haven't been eating well
I haven't been eating
Why are we studying geology?
I'll give you three guesses
I like that it's cold
That's a good T-shirt
I'm going back to the hotel
That isn't acceptable
You don't need to study
Is this a man or a woman?
All right, I'll go
Who's the buyer?
I don't understand this title
I don't have any more
I don't have any more candy
Don't you feel anything here?
I don't have any more food
We don't have any beer left
I'll very likely pass the exam
We've spent all the money
There's a fish
Mary wasn't jealous
Did they write you a letter?
I don't feel like eating today
Are my pictures ready now?
What else should I have done?
Who wants to play?
She won't eat or drink
She doesn't eat or drink
That's completely false
Fight until the end!
The text hasn't been checked
A bit of coffee?
I'll do it first chance I get
I think he'll go out
I can't see with these glasses
I'm not done watching it
We stared at her, bewildered
Let's buy one for him
The wall clock doesn't work
I'll never eat it again
How have you made this video?
How did you make this video?
They'll get married in June
I'm going to get in shape
I'm the smartest
They won't dare touch you
I have had it with you, Yanni
I'm filing for a divorce
You disgust me, Yanni
I want you out of my house.
Fine!
Yanni's life was in turmoil
You are right, as always
Where did father go?
Yanni stood trial in 2004
Beauty may only be skin-deep
Who said it would be easy?
Yanni fell for Skura's charms
I'm filing for a divorce
I'm filing for a divorce
Till here and no further!
What do you mean?
They didn't get along.
You want a job?
I'll give you a job
That's not how I understood it
God won't forgive it
I'm left on the shelf
Leave it to me!
It's time to go to bed
Tom isn't dating a nurse
He's dating a doctor
Kiss me..
Hey, hey!
Not that type of kiss!
Kiss me now..
Hey, wait!
Not that type of kiss!
He's way off
She's way off
We're building a house
What are the other choices?
Is there any good news?
I don't like boiled eggs
Life won't be easy there
I'm very nervous today
It's been nearly three hours
It's been almost three hours
I'm looking for my wife
Are you sure it's yours?
What'll you cook today?
I've been feeling tired lately
The laundry isn't dry yet
The laundry isn't yet dry
Where are my red socks?
You've been a very naughty boy
You're a very naughty boy
I'm glad to be back again
That's a beautiful drawing
Why aren't you ever satisfied?
You've been under a spell
Does anybody have a question?
The food wasn't wasted
I'm not motivated
Let's count to ten
He doesn't get enough money
I think that's partially true
Don't let your soup get cold
I'm glad that I wasn't here
I don't know much French
Today's Tom and Mary's wedding
We don't need to be doing this
Tom's room smelled terrible
It's a beautiful T-shirt
That'll probably happen
Life is easy, death is cheap
He didn't discover anything
Tom isn't afraid of mice
Their marriage won't last
Do lions eat fish?
I don't blame anybody
If you move, you'll be shot
Tom isn't my first name
It's my middle name
Tom isn't drinking vodka
He's drinking wine
Tom couldn't find the cottage
That's easy for Tom to say
Living is easy, dying is cheap
Can you smell it?
Come listen to the radio!
He's writing a new novel
Xoán is a good student
The news isn't new to me
Don't play with her feelings
Don't be bitter, Steina
Weapons don't kill people
May I talk with the professor?
Is this your fountain pen?
I'm just here to help
I'm just here to visit
I'm just visiting
Now I'm full
You'd better keep quiet
Tom isn't my younger son
He's my older son
I promise I won't tell anybody
How long were the police here?
When will we know the results?
When will we get the results?
It's easy to weave baskets
That'll change this week
Tom isn't getting sloppy
I can't pay that much
Tom isn't still in Boston
There's a hotel there
There's a hotel over there
How much did you spend?
What do I need to bring?
I'm not a good French teacher
We won't leave you behind
Tom wasn't at the meeting
Tom isn't here at school today
Tom isn't from the South
He's from the North
I'll do it next week
I'll try to do that next week
Tom isn't a crazy person
It's nebulous
It's important to keep busy
Tom isn't studying French
He's studying English
Tom isn't Mary's grandson
He's her nephew
Of course, I could be wrong
I was at my parents'
Tom hasn't sold his car yet
So, you believe me after all
Tom isn't cooking dinner
He's baking bread
Exactly!
Now we don't have time for it
Do you think we'll find him?
When were you a soldier?
How long ago did you retire?
Can you live abroad?
What's that used for?
What do you use that for?
Is the book good?
The food's good
The food's not good
I almost didn't pass that test
Tom isn't eating a peach
He's eating a plum
He's wearing glasses
Now let's have a little music
Tom isn't in his room now
Yanni is under Skura's control
How do you tighten this screw?
To the right or to the left?
How do you tighten this screw?
Clockwise or counterclockwise?
Stay here in the car, OK?
Tom isn't afraid of bees
Happiness doesn't last forever
Can I sit here?
Suit yourself.
Yanni forged his father's will
Why is all this talking?
It wasn't in her DNA
You should, of course, say yes
Tom isn't a drummer, either
It doesn't seem worth it to me
Tom isn't going home now
He's going to Mary's
Tom isn't drinking vodka
Tom isn't faster than us
Where is Manisa?
Tom isn't coughing now
Tom doesn't drink vodka
We mustn't stay indifferent
You're worth it
Unless it's dead
Aren't you Sami?
It'll help in the long run
Are you still sleeping?
Tom wasn't listening to me
Tom isn't Mary's gardener
Why haven't you had breakfast?
I'm Tom, the gardener
Did anyone ask you?
It doesn't always work for me
You're worth the effort
I didn't really dream
I don't like PubG video game
Can you take a picture of me?
The battery doesn't charge
Go with her!
Go with him!
I'm coming out of my shell
Tom isn't at the party now
You're looking for work
You're looking for a job
I'm all wet
Tom, I'm starting to miss you
It's quiet now
Everything's quiet now
Why's it so quiet in here?
Mary isn't Tom granddaughter
She's his niece
I won't pay that much
Tom isn't eating popcorn
Does Tom have a chance to win?
I'm starting to miss you
I'm starting to miss Tom
Tennis is one of Tom's hobbies
I can't find the dustpan
Did you do something with it?
I can't find the dustpan
Where did you put it?
Now, he's enjoying life
Look!
It's a bald eagle
Do you find this color pretty?
I don't like any hats
What is self-harm?
One day, he committed suicide
May I play the harp?
It's warm all year here
What country is Tom from?
Tom said that he'd rather stay
Tom said he'd rather stay
Is a doctor on the ship?
That'll probably happen soon
That'll probably happen today
Who drew that?
Who destroyed the window?
Now I can't work
I found him!
I don't have money on me
How does the soup taste?
Don't drink and drive!
Does the soup taste OK?
We've helped Tom a lot
Do you want anything to drink?
What do you think of the soup?
How tall is it?
I like that T-shirt
I've drunk three beers already
Thank heavens you're back
Has Tom had lunch?
That just doesn't happen
I don't pay Tom to do that
It's Tom's turn
Is Tom crying?
It's my turn to speak
Did Tom write to Mary?
Tom's shoes are brown
What ISP do you use?
What is your ISP?
What kind of garbage is that?
Let's buy Tom one
Would you sit with me?
Tom doesn't hunt anymore
All I'm trying to do is help
What did Tom put in the box?
Look, it's a snowstorm!
His chimney isn't smoking
Ask her when she'll come back
Don't let this become a habit
We didn't ask you to do this
If only I had your problems!
We've helped Tom
This plan isn't really new
In Spain, people eat very late
What do you need money for?
What do the glasses cost?
Who are you all?
How did you come here and why?
Hi, what's up?
Don't buy that one
This one's better
The day he was born, it rained
Tigers aren't pets
Dragons aren't pets
Go ahead and take a seat, Kate
How are you all?
It's an everyday mistake
I don't want to read the book
How's it going?
He shouldn't even be out there
Laughing is healthy!
Don't let Tom eat peanuts
He's bought a digital camera
Are you thirsty?
Cheers!
Don't pretend nothing's wrong
I've changed my schedule a bit
Why does it keep on happening?
I'm not going to pay that much
Goodnight, Tom
Where's my water bottle?
Where's my thermos?
Where's my canteen?
Mary isn't very friendly
Why is Mary crying?
Because of you.
That didn't happen either
Is that a crow?
Is that our bus?
Tom's hair is short
It's now my turn to speak
I'm glad we sat near the front
College isn't for everyone
Who'll be our next president?
Who left all this junk here?
You'd better get dressed now
It shouldn't happen that way
You don't sound too happy
Can you hear me?
I can hear you.
Tom camped in Mary's yard
Get out of the car, sir
You're under arrest.
What?
What have I done?
Maybe he won't come back
I don't charge for overtime
It's normal to fall down
Don't bring it
What do I want this money for?
Is he always angry?
Who do we have to invite?
Has Tom already arrived?
I don't deserve them
It's not a deep wound
It's just a scratch
You're not feeling well
I don't have more than that
What can you say about that?
Hypocrisy is Tom's middle name
How should we go about this?
My parents think I'm a creep
I don't have one on me, sir.
Please get out of the car.
What do you mean?
We couldn't buy gasoline
I'm not really into dancing
Yanni has wrecked Skura's life
It's not me, it's you!
He hugged the horse's neck
If I'm mistaken, correct me
Stop should-ing on yourself
Aren't you happy?
What's the problem?
I had a great time.
I had a great time, too.
When can I see you again.
I don't know.
How about tomorrow at four?
Maybe.
Is it a yes?
Maybe...
I'll take it as a yes, then.
Bye.
Call me.
Sure thing!
Unlock the door.
You're not going anywhere
Get in the back.
Yanni's life is in turmoil
Are you looking for trouble?
Are you talking to me?
What do you mean?
Leave that girl alone.
What is it to you?
Did you hear me?
Leave that girl alone.
It's none of your business.
Are you looking for trouble?
I am trouble.
So let's settle this outside.
Are you looking for trouble?
Who, me?
Yeah.
Screw off!
Leave that girl alone.
Just screw off!
Are you looking for trouble?
Why don't you just fuck off?
We don't want to leave, either
I won't help him anymore
His chimney isn't smoking
His chimney isn't smoking
He may not be at home or..
Seriously, it's not a big deal
Yanni shot himself.
Really?
Yanni shot himself.
Has Tom contacted you?
It is an honor!
It's an honor!
What's your ISP?
Should I help you?
I don't have time today
Has Tom been in touch?
That simply won't work
That's part of our heritage
He should've listened to them
I need more.
Well there's no more.
I need more.
Well there isn't any more.
It's something I love to do
This gift isn't from Tom
It wasn't a close game
However, I don't know it
Good on you for telling me!
He's gotten on the bus
I doubt that it's over
I'm allergic to nuts
Did you do the homework?
And so, when're we going out?
I'm going to sleep!
How do you validate your card?
Excuse me, can I pass through?
He's a first grader
You better stay silent!
He's a little wild
I'm 162 centimeters tall
Nice t-shirt!
We're protecting our lives
I'm soaking wet!
Who's Peter?
Who is Peter?
I'd like your help on this
Of course, I may be wrong
I'll stay if I want to
Down with the emperor!
It's not quite a done deal
You'd better let me do this
Hey, these things happen
It's time for us to move on
I'm ashamed I did it
It's a minor wound
The brakes didn't respond
They're looking for my book
We're in the middle of summer
How do you study?
I've found another problem
Which one is leaking?
Tom's feet are very dirty
It's a fraction
It's not your turn yet
What shall I tell Tom?
The man's armed
Well, I want another coffee
We're not open on Mondays
Why do people need to do that?
Is Tom that important?
Why did you open the window?
Why did you close the window?
Why did you close the door?
Why did you shut the gate?
Why didn't you shut the gate?
Tom isn't alive anymore
Yanni spotted Skura's weakness
Of course, we're working
That'll happen in due time
Yanni has taken a man's life
Yanni's answers rang true
Yanni's life was worth that
Yanni did it.
What do you mean?
He shot Skura.
How did this become your life?
I've had enough!
I don't mean to be rude
I've said my piece
No it hasn't!
It always was one.
It has not!
It always was one.
Women don't have a goatee
Wastage was cut by 50 percent
I bet you didn't plan for that
It's a good deal for us
What should I prepare for?
I'm not isolated anymore
Tom's feet were very dirty
What can we find inside?
I was at one of my classmates'
Tom's dog was with him
That's all still there
Who's Joe Biden?
He's smart, but not wise
I'm close
Tom's book got published
They've gone crazy
When is your lunch break?
You're my only friend
Do you know his wife?
I'll never abandon you
Are they all unharmed?
Can you give me their address?
Can you tell me their titles?
Now go away!
Answer in English, please
We're just colleagues
I know he doesn't like us
Why am I being fined?
I'm going to call us an Uber
I'll look at it later
Chances are I'll be awake
Are your feet ticklish?
We didn't play well as a team
You don't need to do anything
I'll take care of it
You've done a wonderful job
You shouldn't rely on others
Tom's hands were very dirty
It's great to be alive
Where's my cellphone?
The movie's starting
The concert's starting
How long is intermission?
I'm looking for my pen?
Of course, I'm frustrated
That's really a great question
Eventually, we all die
We'll all eventually die
They didn't die in vain
A total of 300 people died
We don't yet know how Tom died
At least, we won't die hungry
We're not afraid to die
We aren't afraid to die
We don't want anyone to die
We don't want anybody to die
You know I'd die for you
You know that I'd die for you
If Tom wins, I'll eat my hat
We don't like the same things
I'd prefer to do this later
I close my shop at 5:00
Yanni's parents split up
How do I look?
You look like a fat cow.
Yanni hid at his father's home
Yanni's murder is in the news
Tom's hands are very dirty
This is baffling.
Yanni needs money.
He isn't getting any.
This was Yanni's life
I'm taking all the money.
Oh yeah?
We'll see about that.
Yanni didn't call.
Time for plan B.
That isn't the deal we made
What's that film about?
He won't miss me
That'll happen soon enough
I kept missing Tom's calls
What do you mean?
He gave her flowers yesterday.
Are these flowers from Yanni?
Yes, but don't worry
Don't put words into my mouth
Sure!
Does everybody have pencils?
Where's my wallet?
It's here
Cool down.
Do you want that soufflé?
Did you enjoy that soufflé?
It was delicious.
Two soufflés, please
A soufflé, please.
Make it two.
What is it, sweetheart?
I feel hot.
I'm just gonna sit here
How many people were standing?
Why wouldn't Tom help us?
Do I look fat?
You look great.
Do I look fat?
A little bit, yes.
My son does not lie.
Do you mean that mine does?
How come?
How come?
Are you crazy?
Where have you been?
What do you mean?
That definitely didn't help
I need to talk to Tom, too

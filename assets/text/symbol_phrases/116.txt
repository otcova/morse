Neither do I!
We address each other as "vous
Kate didn't attend the meeting
She can't live without him
Your dog has huge paws!
I'll come back later

Down with corrupt politicians!
I don't know what else to do
This is Ken's dog
Ken couldn't remember his name
I'm cured, anesthetized
Mine is black!
Our 2CV broke down
We're not there yet

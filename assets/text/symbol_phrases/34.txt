Ziri's story isn't scary
Ziri's story is a long one
Ziri wasn't able to rest
That's another story entirely
Ziri didn't show Rima his face
Ziri refused Rima's help
What did you use this for?
Ziri didn't even say thank you
Ziri hasn't heard a sound
Ziri's child is with us
Ziri wasn't in sight
Ziri still hasn't moved
Ziri disapeared in 2004
Ziri's answer was a solid no
Ziri's eyes shut open in panic
Ziri's face was frozen in fear
Ziri wasn't much of a runner
Later, Ziri recovered
Ziri's behavior was not normal
Ziri wasn't easily scared
Ziri wasn't looking anymore
It's just a well
Ziri really didn't believe it
Ziri didn't hear the car
Ziri couldn't explain that
This made Ziri's heart pound
Ziri was there, yelling
Why is Ziri so dirty?
The beach wouldn't be crowded
What was freaking Ziri out?
Ziri's stomach flipped
Ziri wasn't even cooking
Ziri's head was bloody
Ziri wasn't bleeding heavily
Ziri wasn't transferred
Ziri didn't mourn for long
Ziri's pickup truck was stolen
Ziri's back left tire was flat
Ziri didn't want to stop
Ziri's skin was dark
Ziri can't run that fast
Ziri saw Rima's eyes
Ziri passed Rima's truck
Protect your hard-earned money
Ziri's paranoia kicked in
Ziri wasn't paying attention
Ziri doesn't really buy that
Ziri feels he's being watched
Ziri couldn't see Rima
Ziri's house has a bad history
Ziri can't see anything
Ziri shouldn't be here
Ziri won't take forever
Ziri didn't know who was there
Don't send kids to drag shows
Ziri's phone is dead
Ziri is in the truck, too
You can't change Ziri
You've heard everything
Practice self-awareness
I can't make a choice for you
Don't misgender me
What do you do?
I'm a poet.
No, I mean for work.
If it rains, I don't care
She's upstairs
I couldn't hide my elation
The wind is really strong!
Beware of the shattered glass!
Where did Tom get a job?
I don’t do Tom’s
I'm going to take a walk
May I go?
No!
No!
A thousand times, no!
He can't be left alone
You have children?
Tell me everything!
She's the daughter of my son
What if the bus is late?
We're living on stolen land
It shouldn't take long
That's the best part of my job
It's from 1993
Isn't it ironic?
The sea doesn't care about us
How strong was the earthquake?
I just realized I'm dreaming
It's OK to be gay, kids
It's OK to be trans, kids
I'll be gone for two weeks
Let's have a short rest here
I won't go there any more
I haven't got a car any more
Sorry, I'm busy at the moment
We should've got married
Looks as if your dog's thirsty
You can say that again, bruv.
She's got no one to turn to
It's two in the afternoon
He's always very busy
Ask her when she's coming back
How much does it cost a day?
When did you arrive?
Today?
I see a pattern, there
Do we still have a map?
I'm on disability
Why is it like that?
It looks like it's alive
It's deeply problematic
It's a generalization
Ziri enjoyed Rima's stories
Ziri isn't exaggerating at all
Ziri wasn't the only one
Ziri paid for Rima's purchases
Ziri's things are ruined
Ziri's clothes were ruined
Ziri got his suit dry-cleaned
Ziri is Rima's pursuer
Rima's Kabyle dress tore
Ziri's words intrigued Rima
Ziri's job was paying well
Ziri's company was paying well
Rima?
What a nice girl!
Ziri returned to Rima's agency
Ziri doesn't thank God
Ziri's tongue slipped
Why is Ziri rolling his eyes?
Don't fall prey to Ziri's pity
Ziri didn't clean up
We need to stay goal-oriented
To Ziri, Rima is just a grade
Ziri's mom is dead
What's Ziri's story?
Consume magnesium-rich foods
Ziri's mom isn't around
Ziri cleaned Rima's boots
Now what is Ziri meant to do?
It's a lifestyle
Ziri calls Rima "Riri.
Are the dates ripe?
She'd never considered losing
You can't keep living this way
I'm writing a space opera
I'm a farmer by trade
I'm a copy editor
I'm a barista
Don't take Tom with you
He's my friend from university
It's a compromise
That's just how it is.
Why is that how it is?
I have no ideology.
And I have no accent.
Your argument was well-made
I can't discuss it right now
I'm feeling sick to my stomach
I'll see you in five minutes
I'm feeling chilly
I'd like to sleep
Would it be okay if I left?
No wine today, please
Is it okay if I lie down?
It's a grift
I’m not on duty tomorrow
He's too weak to even speak
Yes, I did it.
It's a fantastic resource
It's an extremely useful book
Can you budge up?
I feel like I'm treading water
Can you turn on the light?
Can’t see anything
Could you turn the light on?
Yes, I did it
I'm monitoring everything
How happy was Abrams?
I'm a Canadian just like you
Oh.
Did you milk the goat?
Did you milk the she-goat?
Are you guys Bulgarian?
Are you gals Bulgarian?
No, I didn't do it
What does the little hand say?
What does the big hand say?
Does the flat have a garden?
You're not allowed out now.
Why not?
Here in Thailand?
Can't have been.
That can happen occasionally.
Occasionally?
It happens all the time!
Why don't you like me?
Because you're nasty!
I'll find myself another hobby
Would you prefer it if I left?
Would you rather I left?
I've got to get used to it
Are the rumours true?
Will your parents be at home?
Aren't you at home any more?
Have you been sick?
Does this look mouldy to you?
He's terrible at maths
Bet you can't do ten press-ups
He's rubbish at maths
What colour is your lorry?
Don't blush
I think it's my bedtime
Can I ring back later?
Can I phone back later?
Can I ring you later?
May I phone you later?
Mr White's garden is large
I don't love you any more
That's why I'm sad
How many bags have you got?
How many sacks have you got?
How many sacks do you have?
They won't be getting a penny
They're not getting a penny
You'll find this map useful
Tom didn't close the window
Where were you on Sunday?
I can't find my watch anywhere
It's too bad we missed it
You should've bought one
Don’t be a fool!
I wish this didn't happen
Don't feed cats you don't know
We haven't been there in ages
Why did he come so late?
We got up at eight o'clock
I'm in awful shape
I'm not in the mood to laugh
I'm exhausted from work
I'm so terribly sorry
I'm confident he'll show up
He'll show up, I'm certain
I'm so curious, I could burst
I'm giddy with excitement
This month, I'm low on money
I've been given the ok to go
I'm looking for a parking spot
Do you want to eat this cake?
I'm completely blind
What to do, I have no idea
I'm sick to death of school
Let's avoid jumping the gun
He isn't as athletic as I am
He isn't as in shape as I am
He isn't performing well
Do you want a drink?
What can I choose?
Yes or no.
Mary's a naughty gal
I've never shot anyone before
I don't know these men
It's been arranged
Does he want to go or not?
Does she want to go or not?
Just watch I'll again be right
Do you do it as a pro?
People don't understand that
I'm quite fond of his mum
It's green, not yellow
Sorry, that came out wrong
I'd like a glass of Pepsi
Is the sentence complete?
Mentally, you are a sock
I'm not the enemy of myself
The match ended 3-0
It is hot, but it isn't humid
I'll wash and you dry
Agreed?
I'll wash up, and you dry up
Agreed?
Agreed?
When are we arriving?
Tomorrow morning, God willing.
Did you like the film?
No, not one bit.
Is that true?
No, it's rubbish, of course.
You're a brick short of a load
No snacking before dinner!
Give me that chocolate!
Give me that chocolate!
I'm not a Coke person
I don't like cocky people
Was the culprit found?
Stop, Nan, please!
I can't manage all that!
Would it be OK if I left?
This event is girls-only
I don't like being called fat
When is the next leap year?
Life's too short for pants
I'll go and make dinner
Who are you, really?
Tom said he'd do his best
I'm here to ask you for help
It's dangerous here
The sentence isn't complete
What you say is just nuts!
Kick the ball!
My alarm clock doesn't work
I don't think it's a wise move
Maybe we heard it wrong?
I'm a present-day person
I'm not available to you
Don't smoke excessively
He's twenty-two years old
Life's been so unjust to me!
He's a strange pirate
It's a personal attack
That's my private plane
What's going on in the world?
You don't have to like me
How many kilos do you weigh?
Did you microchip the dog?
She's majoring in economics
When will the concert start?
I'm here nearly every day
Are you coming to see me?
Need doesn't respect law
What was your most recent job?
Yes, really?
Well, we must live and learn
Really?
Wow!
Algeria doesn't get much rain
Algeria doesn't import water
An American ounce is 28 grams
Do you like hot, spicy food?
Careful, it could break on us
Is it the rain's fault?
What happens after death?
It's late and night falls
I'm going to sleep, goodnight
Can you imagine it?
What are you having for tea?
I'll ring you later today
I'll phone you later today
I'll ring you every night
Stay out of this!
It's none of your business!
I haven't got dressed yet
I've just made us some coffee
I'm your neighbour
Let's get a takeaway
We'll all sing together
Oops, was that a secret?
You're not on the guest list
I don't have any male friends
What is all this, literature?
I hate it!
I stayed at a friend's place
Sometimes, kids are just mean
Hurry up!
I'm happy with my friendships
He'd betrayed our friendship
Is the coffee ready?
It doesn’t make a difference
Do you have any bonus work?
Someone's hitting
I voted "remain
Life is a never-ending fight
It's legal here
I'm going to solve the problem
Sorry, did I hurt you?
Yeah, a little
Europe was ravaged by COVID-19
How does Ziri get things done?
Ziri couldn't stand that
This is Ziri's car.
How old is this junk?
Wow!
You know Berber?
I'm sorry I did that to you
Are you out of your mind?
Why would I do that?
Ziri came out of Rima's room
Jump down, Tom
Don't hesitate
Was Ziri nuts?
What was up with Ziri?
Ziri's glasses fell off
Who came up with this stuff?
Ziri's cat ran away
May has thirty-one days
I expect high-quality work
Don't be so harsh with her
Be nicer to them, Tom
It wasn't Tom's duty
I'm not into marriage
You've never even apologised
He'd done nothing wrong
I won't open this
Is anyone home?
Don't become stuck in the past
I'll take care of the problem
I'm going to find a solution
It shouldn't require much time
It shouldn't be too difficult
You've managed to convince me
Is sex possible without love?
Tom has a philosopher's beard
Could you hold this?
Here, hold this
You're friends, aren't you?
I like that smile!
I won't run away anymore
Feeling refreshed?
What is Morocco up to?
Ziri didn't make any progress
I've never been incarcerated
He's Polish
She's Polish
Do you get on well?
Sign me up, please
I adore women's volleyball
You won't win this game
Wake up, Ziri!
We have to save the horses!
Ziri's name came to mind
Ziri burnt Rima's dessertation
At night, I suffer nightmares
I'm a sucker for conveniences
Are you Polish?
No, I'm Hungarian.
Whose dumb idea was that?
Don't pass the buck to others
I'll make the appointment
I'll arrange for the meeting
Let's have a staring contest
Money doesn't smell
I don't think DNA has pronouns
DNA's pronoun is it
I'll solve it immediately
It's too far to walk there
Shall we go to the theater?
He's angry at me
What a weird noise!
Are we going insane?
I'm glad you like my gift
I'll ask Tom when he gets here
But I can't even climb
Is this how I'm going to die?
I'm a trans person
Do I have to die now?
He's a boy.
Ziri enjoys Rima's tales
Was Ziri a cooperative child?
Was Ziri a well-behaved child?
How many days will it take?
Take the money!
You know I don't need it!
Take this money.
Why?
Because I love you, idiot!
Take all the money.
But why?
Because I love you, silly!
Ziri didn't demand proof
Ziri did some of Rima's chores
Ziri's children misbehaved
Ziri could read people's minds
Ziri couldn't help but laugh
Ziri didn't know sign language
Ziri threw away Rima's gift
Ziri remembered Rima's words
Ziri didn't even let Rima rest
Ziri was invited, too
Ziri saw Rima's dead body
Don't stress over the bill
I'll take care of it
I've never heard such nonsense
Ziri worked for Rima's father
Ziri kissed Rima's lips
Ziri's truck broke down
It's already spring in Algeria
It's still really hot
Sometimes, we screw up
Don't put off an apology
I'm sorry you think that
Ziri has broken Rima's trust
I've made a commitment
He's an expert on flowers
Please don't stop the music
And how's Tom?
Is the water clean?
We mustn't give up hope
Don't give me an attitude
I don't know all my students
I can't bear the pain any more
I won't see him any more
I won't be seeing him any more
He's seriously injured
Don't toy with his feelings
Don't toy with her feelings
Are you good at cooking rice?
I can't paint without my brush
Have you received a reply?
Have you had a reply?
He wouldn't give me a pay rise
I'll swap it for a fiver
Where's your twenty?
I'll swap it for a fiver
It's as heavy as lead
Ah, no, you can't now.
Is that not awesome?
It won't keep
How is this?
I've packed
I wasn't at home
I wish you'd stayed at home
I'm Tom's neighbour
I've agreed
It's my duty
It's past three
Don't answer that question
I don't care to do that
I'm living here
Is your mum in?
When will your wedding be?
Will you let me help you?
I don't hear Tom
I'll work harder
How was that made?
That's my neighbour's dog
Was Tom born here?
Yes, I suppose so
Tom knew it wasn't true
Tom's face brightened
It's extraordinary
No, I didn't forget
Tom didn't come to my party
Don't say that, Tom
I don't wish to know
I've got to go there
What did your mum say?
Who are your neighbours?
That's just what we thought
There's no more left
There's no more coffee left
I'm so miserable
Could I go see Tom?
May I go see Tom?
I wish we hadn't come
That's my handkerchief
What ought to be done?
I can't help shivering
I don't want any either
I think that's been done
Tom didn't follow Mary
What is your name, dear?
Can't you wait till 2:30?
Can't you wait until 2:30?
I didn't quite mean that
I don't want to wake Tom
That's what I meant to do
That wasn't what I meant to do
Tom's eyes grew rounder
I wish I hadn't been born
What do you wish me to do?
What ought I to have done?
Are you sure you're well?
You don't hate me, do you?
Are you sure Tom is married?
I'm going back to Tom
I'd rather not come in
There's enough for all of us
You're very philosophical
Be as quiet as you can, please
I didn't know Tom was coming
Tom didn't answer directly
Aren't we going to stay here?
I'm sure you don't think so
Tom doesn't know you're sick
I don't wish to see Tom again
I'll open a window
Did the noise keep you awake?
I don't deserve your kindness
Are you depressed, Tom?
I wish I'd been able to do so
Who do you think that girl is?
Did Tom say he'd come again?
I'll write to Tom about it
You know I wouldn't desert you
I'm glad you didn't wait
Are you in bed, Tom?
Tom won't be awake yet
It was a warm, cloudless day
Have you reserved a seat?
I'll buy this book
I didn't tell Tom I'd be there
Tom won't likely find Mary
People don't understand us
What a strange person Tom is!
I wish I hadn't stayed so long
I'd rather leave before noon
I hope that I'll be forgiven
I don't think Tom saw me
That's why I don't want to
I've got Tom to look after now
I've made up my mind to quit
We'll soon have plenty to do
Do you both understand French?
Poor cat!
He'd dozed off in his clothes
He's helped me get a job
He's always on the move
What infuriated Tom so much?
Let's hope it's temporary
It doesn't sit well with me
It's not my responsibility
Can you come to my house?
He's well-versed in his field
He's skilled at what he does
I'm aware of what I must do
I'm doing well at work
Is there Internet in the room?
Do you watch the news?
Where is my mail?
It's not for everyone, though
You can't eat these medlars
Let's try these medlars
Some people don't like loquats
I'm not interested in chess
How do loquats taste?
These are loquats.
They don't taste like loquats.
When do you pick medlars?
Are the medlars ripe?
I've got a bottle of whisky
It's just stopped raining
Who took my handbag?
Dance?
Maybe you'll meet him
You've been correctly informed
But have you landed yet?
My car doesn't have a satnav
My car hasn't got a satnav
Who won the Euros?
I'm allergic to dust mites
I don't need a man to be happy
Why?" asked the boy
How do you blet medlars?
This is a good-size medlar
Ziri can't reach those medlars
Are medlars edible?
That's one of my centres.
My father doesn't let me do it
I know I'm a burden
You can't eat medlar seeds
Would you like some more?
No, I'm full.
What would you gain by that?
When bletted, medlars are soft
This pencil isn't grey
These medlars are rotten.
They're bletted.
Pardon me?
They're not rotten
Where were you the whole time?
At first, I thought he was ill
Don't drop the cup
If only I'd married her
I'm tired but I can't sleep
There's not a soul there
There's not a soul about
It's possible, but unlikely
What've you done with my pen?
I'm going to have lunch
Bring me a blanket, please
She's coming as well?
Is she coming as well?
It's late
I've got to go
It's late
I've got to be off
Fill this form in, please
Why are you telling me that?
Can they speak English?
English, please
English, please.
Oh, hi, Tom
My grandma is 93 years old
Is everything alright?
Djemaa-Saharidj under snow
I can speak Greek, a little
That'll be hard to measure
That's the approach we took
Tom's approach is different
That's the way I'd approach it
How do you measure happiness?
How do you measure success?
That's kind of what I expected
Meaning, something?
Here it is.
Pfff, you’re so lame.
Didn’t you go a little nutso?
Didn’t you crack up?
I don’t give a toss
You're a clever one!
Tom, you're a clever one
Cookie licked Tom's nose
Over 1,910 records
They're all extraordinary
Have you escaped?
You're not a serious person
I'm not interested in cis men
Why do people care?
Don't pick it up!
That's what my partner says
It's his job
It's easy to make!
Do you know the origin?
It's kind of hard to imagine
These seeds don't store well
Ziri's well ran dry
I've never played soccer
Oh, that's very good!
Here's your book
Without you, I'd be lost
Ziri's standards are too high
Where's my kid?
We're a great match
Can I drink the water here?
Where's my younger sister?
Dov is a self-hating Jew.
You mean he criticizes Israel?
Where's my older sister?
How's the shot treating you?
Are humans OK?
Why not learn how to cook?
Because I'm lonely.
I'm ready to move in with you
Good, that's good
It's okay then
Shh!
You're talking too loud!
He didn't explicitly answer
Who were you talking to?
God.
Where's our son?
Where's our daughter?
Where's our kid?
Where's our baby?
They didn't have a cat
Do you know the truth?
When should dinner be held?
You see it’s all clear
Cocaine is bad.
I haven't done coke in years
Sorry, did I hurt you?
Yeah, a little
Nice try, FBI
Not today, CIA
Tom's plan is complicated
It's a waste of your life
Where do I need to go?
No, I'm still working on it
How about you?
There's no way to protect you
How deep is that well?
It's my duty to protect you
Why is that bell ringing?
Daniel slit the pig’s throat
You'll notice a difference
Daniel’s mother comforted him
Will he get better soon?
I think so.
David's father cannot read
David can't hire a lawyer
Donald smelt Jessica's jacket
Successful at what?
He's afraid of getting sick
She's afraid of getting sick
States' rights to do what?
This is your guys' house
Are you on vacation here?
Have you heard of Catullus?
Of course!
What do you think of him?
I hate and I love him.
Do you both speak German?
You don't pass the Turing test
Why is February so short?
We're back!
I'm not good at selling myself
I'll stay at home
I'm focusing on it
I'm focusing.
I'm just sensitive to energies
You saved money?
You don't know the S of save!
Jessica looks like a model.
Stop staring at her like this!
Challenge accepted!
He doesn't even look at me
I'm so sorry I was so blind
We don't have room for a pig
Let's go play together
Let's go play!
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
Sure.
A pig fell in a mud puddle.
Turn around, I need to change
I'm looking around the shops
I'm so happy to hear from you
Donald was on Dad's back
Donald was handsome, too
Sometimes, Donald hit Jessica
Donald's son was born alright
Donald was a good-looking man
Donald didn't have a real job
When Donald died, Jessica left
My parents' house is very old
Just don't stop dreaming
Donald's mom is a bad cook
How dare you ruin my jacket?
It was an accident.
Donald my bestie?
Donald's parents went bankrupt
What's your opinion, Tom?
That's a very plaintive meow
That's kooky
He's a bit kooky
Don't fuck with the IRS
Cats' paws are very sensitive
She's learning Hungarian
He's learning Hungarian
Oh, it's my daughter
I don't know, Tom
What?!
He's a bit of a kook
Is there silicon-based life?
I can't remember the date
You ordered pizza again?
Why can't you cook?
You can't talk to us like that
Laser is currently operating!
Use extreme caution!
Zip your mouth, Donald
I'm not in the mood for this
Donald wasn't on that list
Donald rode to Jessica's farm
I'm sure it's your doing
Well, not with me.
Who got you in a bad mood?
What got you in a bad mood?
I've never played football
How long were you with Donald?
Four years.
How come Donald didn't freeze?
It's so awful to hear that
I'd want to eat something
How can you be soft on Israel?
It's coming back to me now
What is happiness to you, Tom?
Now you come, Tom!
Can this water be drunk?
Do you still trust people?
They can't go on without Tom
What floor is the computer on?
Parents' rights to do what?
I know how it feels too!
We are closing at 8 today
He's not of this world
She's not of this world
Tom mustn't get away with that
It's fool's gold
I don't like that band anymore
I've never milked a cow before
Today I'm a little depressed
It's my job to notice things
We weren't given prior notice
Tom couldn't find a bucket
Read what's on the box
Don't move that box
What's behind that box?
What's behind those boxes?
Where's the box of tissues?
Can you get me a box for this?
Let's think outside of the box
Everyone knows pigs can't fly
There's a fly in my soup
I know when I'm beat
That isn't quite correct
That's not quite correct
You're 100 percent correct
That's not actually correct
That isn't factually correct
That's not factually correct
You can't correct everything
That's only partially correct
As far as I know, that's right
You're 100% correct about that
Tom's assessment was correct
The correct answer is "yes.
Which answer is correct?
Everything you've said is true
We're running out of oxygen
What Tom told us wasn't true
It's already stopped raining
He's decided not to drink
Joe Biden" wants a world war
Tell me that you're all mine
Suddenly, he punched the table
Hey, you!
What are you doing in my room?
No arguing, just get to it
He's a horrible person
I'm cleaning the table
Look at that thing!
For real?
You've been running," she says
Yes," he wheezes
Who's that calling your name?
Wait – where are you going?
Call of nature.
What?
The loo!
Is it ten past?
No, it's quarter to six.
They're immodestly dressed
Tom's got some heady bud
What a crock!

It's a heuristic solution
I just wish you'd shut up

You're really valuable to me
You're someone I admire
You're a person I respect
You're unique in my eyes
You're unique to me

You've truly won me over
You're extremely lovely

Everyone is exhausted.
Tom?
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
However, my shoulder hurts
Tom's clone is on the loose
You've caught me off guard
Do not eat donuts!
How long is the surgery?

It's almost unbreakable
It's a Maserati.
Is it linguini or linguine?
I've always hated Tom
I've always hated her
I've always hated him
It's kind of fun
I can't save you this time
I have $300
I'm not young
I'd study harder if I were you
I'll wait out in front for you
I'm not going to abandon you
I'm sure glad I found you
I'm sorry I startled you
I don't think Tom is ready yet
I'm not ready to leave yet
I'm not done with Tom yet
I haven't kissed Tom yet
I hope Tom's wrong
I don't know where Tom works
I'm hard working
I'll meet you after work
I don't know Tom very well
I like Tom, but he's weird

I've done the wrong thing
I'll call Tom when I get there
I've got to go in there
I'll meet you up there
I'll see you in there

I don't know if I can do that
I'm still not sure about that
I've forgotten how to do that
I'm not sure why I did that
I won't let anyone do that
I'm not worried about that
I'm going and that's that
I didn't see Tom do that
I'm no longer a teacher
I'm not tall

I've found everything I need
I've got everything we need
I'd like to wring Tom's neck
I'm kind of confused myself
I've missed Tom so much
I wasn't very motivated
I'll see Tom in the morning
I'm sorry about your mom
I've only got fifteen minutes
I'm not narrow-minded
I'm open-minded
I'll bear it in mind
I'm not mean
I think Tom's interested in me
I thought Tom wouldn't like me
I bet Tom doesn't remember me
I can't believe Tom kissed me
I'll help you if you help me
I'm pretty sure Tom likes me
I'm not materialistic
I'd like Tom to meet Mary
I'm pretty sure Tom's lying
I wasn't lucky
I'm not lucky
I'm not good-looking
I don't know where Tom lives
I wasn't the team leader
I'm not lazy
I'm sorry, I just don't know
I'm right here in the kitchen
I'm only doing my job
I think I'll be able to fix it
I don't know how Tom does it
I don't want Tom to see it
I'm not sure if Tom saw it
I can't quite believe it
I'm happy Tom liked it
I'm glad to hear it
I'll use it
I'm as surprised as Tom is
I'm not interfering
I'm not inflexible
I wasn't indiscreet
I'm not incompetent
I've got to come in

I just want to be Tom's friend
I know Tom can't speak French
I've got a lot to make up for

I borrowed Tom's car
I'm pretty sure Tom's Canadian
I'm thinking as fast as I can
I'm friends with Tom's brother
I'm not brave
I'm sorry to be such a bother
I'll see you all in Boston
I'll meet you in Boston
I'm not bossy
I showed Tom who's boss
I've only got myself to blame
I borrowed Tom's bicycle
I'm pretty sure Tom's biased
I'm not biased
I haven't seen Tom here before
I've never made cookies before
I'm pretty sure Tom's bald
I'm not bald
I'm bald
I'm glad you got back
I'll get on it right away
I like Tom's attitude
I'll try not to fall asleep
I'll do anything that Tom asks
I'll do whatever Tom asks
I'll see Tom around
I'm sure Tom wouldn't approve
I'm sure Tom would approve
I don't care about Tom anymore
I don't know Tom anymore
I'm pretty sure Tom's angry
I've said too much already
I guess I'm lucky to be alive
I was hoping I'd see Tom again
I can't wait to see you again
I'll never see Tom again
I'm not adventurous
I'm not as creative as Tom is
I'm not as creative as Tom
You can't go home until 2:30
You couldn't do it, could you?
You got your wish, didn't you?
You just got here, didn't you?
You live near here, don't you?
You play the piano, don't you?
You think I'm weak, don't you?
You'll let me know, won't you?
You're mad at Tom, aren't you?
You made that up, didn't you?
You want me to go, don't you?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
You can't stand it, can you?
You'll see to it, won't you?
You can't help it, can you?
You can't open it, can you?
You can't go home yet
You know I'm wrong
You're still wrong
You're a crazy woman
You're a kind woman
You'll fit in well
You'll find a way
You've got a visitor
You can't run away from us
You can't kill both of us
You can't fire us
You can't stop us
You've got to call me tomorrow
You're not too old for Tom
You crack me up, Tom
You can't run, Tom
You can't win, Tom
You did fine, Tom
You did well, Tom
You got shot, Tom
You blew it, Tom
You're just in time
You can't run away from this
You've got to do this
You're part of this
You can't use this
You can't force me to do that
You can't do that
You're still my son
You see, I'm right
You've got a rash
You've got a problem
You're a kind person
You've helped me out
You've got each other
You come back soon, OK?
You've got to go now

You'll find a job
You're grown men
You can't deny it
You can't sell it
You can't stop it
You'd better come in
You've got to go home
You've got to hide
You've got my helmet
You've got my goggles
You've got to go
You're just a girl
You'll do just fine
You've got a fever
You've got a black eye
You're a smart boy
You're just a boy
You can't kill us both
You can't both be the boss
You know where I'll be
You can't get away
You can't run away
You can't help Tom anymore
You bet I'm angry
You've done that already
Tom's hands were cold
Tom wasn't wearing socks
Let me alone!
It'll be all right
They won't be cold
I've just arrived from Paris
She's a real beauty
Tom's going commando today
Don't try two things at once
John, did you see the cat?
Give me a painkiller, please
How did I not think of it?
He's very high on LSD
He's not eating right
I think he's sick
Can I go there now?
I've been to Kyoto two times
There aren't any more comments
We're all here except for him
He has a sky-blue pullover
Do you have any money on you?
Is this of any use to you?
Did Tom bite you?
Does it bug you?
Did I wake you?
Has it been fixed yet?
Have you sold it yet?
Am I ever wrong?
Have you seen my wife?
Could I ask why?
Would you sing at our wedding?
It's all I want
Is Tom mad at us?
Do you mean us?
Did you just wake up?
Do you want to watch TV?
Are you going to kiss Tom?
Did you sue Tom?
Did you hit Tom?
Are you done with this?
How old is this?
Here, try this
Do I need this?
Do I look thirty?
Here, try these
Did you guys hear that?
Are you done with that?
How old is that?
Did I drop that?
Am I a suspect?
Do you use all this stuff?
That's not a bad story
Here, try some
That's not a good sign
Have you ever been shot?
Did you iron all the shirts?
Will you wait a second?
Did we solve the problem?
Am I a prisoner?
Did you call the police?
Do you see my point?
It's a bad plan
Do you own this place?
Do you want to go out?
Are you asking me out?
Here, try it on
Are you sure you're OK?
Does it look OK?
Is the baby OK?
Do you feel OK?
Do you need to do that now?
Will you help us now?
Is Tom here now?
Did you watch the news?
It's all I need
Tom's very neat
Is it too much?
This can't wait until morning
Do you have any more?
Has Tom changed his mind?
Will you still help me?
Do you want to join me?
Did you do that for me?
Are you here to see me?
Do you still need me?
Do you still hate me?
Hey, look at me
Did you need me?
Do you need me?
How can I lose?
How did I look?
It can't take much longer
Have you been here long?
Am I allowed to leave?
Tom's very lazy
Is it too late?
It's all I know
Have you found a job?
Have you seen my jacket?
Do you want to share it?
Do you want to take it?
Are you going to do it?
Do you think I did it?
Should I try it?
Did you sign it?
Did you read it?
Did you mean it?
Did you find it?
Could I have it?
So let's do it
Is it worth it?
How hard is it?
Do you miss it?
Do you mean it?
Do you hear it?
Do you hate it?
Do you deny it?
Did you use it?
Did you fix it?
Did we miss it?
Did I break it?
Are you going to break in?
Are you coming back in?
That's not a good idea
It's a good idea
It's a bad idea
Do you want to know how?
It's a long way from here
Are you sure it's here?
How may we help?
It's all I've got
Do you mind if I go?
How did work go?
Did you miss the game?
How am I doing?
That's all I do
So what do I do?
Have you found a cure?
Did you sign the contract?
That's a good choice
Do you think I care?
Do you want me to beg?
Do you feel bad?
Do you want any?
You don't even like fish
Do you like Tom?
Do you really love me?
Yes.
Help me, please
I'm feeling depressed
Good night!
You don't need to wrap it
You're still taller than me
They aren't ripe at all
No, we didn't bring anything
You do nothing, while I work
I can't seem to quit smoking
It isn't permitted
I'm going to London
Why don't you email me?
Have you finished the job?
Out of 10, I'd give it a 6
Who will be able to predict?
It's useless!
What's the room's price?
Come what may!
Know thyself!
Tom's mother is such a gossip
Let's pick nits
Let's pick headlice
I pick weaver ant's nests
Let's pod peas
Let's shuck corn
Let's skin the snake
Let's husk the coconut
Let's shell the nut
Let's unearth the potatoes
Let's unearth the onions
Let's unearth the garlics
Let's unearth the gingers
Let's cut the dike
Let's build a dike
Let's check for head-lice
Let's blow nose
I've got a booger
I've got an eye booger
I've got an ear booger
I'm able to speak French
It's not important anymore
He's happy
She's happy
Do you remember this movie?
Can you guess what this is?
I don't like flowers so much
Don't trust what Tom says
She's my wife's friend
I'm Ricardo
I wish I hadn't married Tom
I wish I hadn't gotten married
Are you going to open the box?
No, Tom, I will not marry you!
How do you know all of this?
You're not the man I married
I've got stuff to do
I've got lots to say
You'd better stop doing that
You've been so good to us
Would you mind if I drive?
Don't you ever wonder why?
Do you have an umbrella?
Are you hard of hearing?
Are you doing all right?
You've got to trust me
You've got to help Tom
You'd better stop Tom
You've done it wrong
Are you that hard up?
Are you sure of this?
You've made us wait
You've got the idea
You've got my phone
You've got 24 hours
You've been so kind
You're sort of rude
You're not done yet
You're being a fool
Aren't you going in?
Are you doing OK?
Tom's very weak
Tom'll be ready
I don't know the alarm code
This bus can carry 30 people
This is a 30-passenger bus
Where are the wolves?
She is a self-oriented person
We've got some demands
What are your demands?
Are you helping Tom?
Are you going to help Tom?
Does Tom really need help?
Do you intend to help Tom?
Are you planning to help Tom?
You're nothing to me
I think he's not over his ex
It's important
We're going to try again
He's married to my cousin
It's hardly a secret
No, that's not what I meant!
You're not mad at me, are you?
You bet I'm worried
You've got three weeks
You shouldn't be up
You're all grown up
You let me down, Tom
You're too kind, Tom
You've grown up, Tom
You're right on time
You've got to stop this
You'd better read this
You're great at this
You can't stop this
You'll die out there
You know it's wrong to do that
You'd better take that
You can't have that
You can't know that
You're in fine shape
You'll do as I say
You've got three problems
You'd better watch out
You'll figure it out
You'll soon find out
You've got my number
You're in charge now
You've got till noon
You'd be a great mother
You wanted to see me?
You'll never stop me
You won't beat me
You've all gone mad
You've taught me a lot
You've got nice legs
You're free to leave
You'd better take it
You'll never find it
You've got to fix it
You've got to try it
You can't handle it
You've got three hours
You said you'd help
You've been a good friend
You can't live forever
You've got to go faster
You've gone too far
You've made your choice
You've got no choice
You said you'd call
You've got to come back
You've got my attention
I'm not a big spender
Don't get defensive
I'm not blaming you
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm not being defensive
You can't ignore it
You're all I've got
You're still a child
Maybe this isn't a bad thing
That's Tom, my teddy-bear
Do you think I'm wrong?
Are you sure it'll work?
Can you wait a few weeks?
Are you still there, Tom?
Do you think I'm right?
Do you mean Tom is rich?
Have you read this report?
I lost 30 pounds
Do you want to find out?
Are you going to go now?
Tom's very nice
Do you think I'm lying?
Have you lived here long?
Will you drop by later?
Do you still have a key?
Are you just getting in?
Do you want me to come?
Do you live in the area?
Who will win the World Cup?
Have you lost the receipt?
Have you been working out?
You're making a mess
Are you taking your meds?
You know I'm married
You've done your job
Are you coming to dinner?
You've done it again
Did you see the accident?
The score is 1-0
Here we come!
Are you hiding something, Tom?
She's a natural beauty
What's the horse's name?
What's your horse's name?
I'll stay here and watch you
Where is the money, Tom?
Mind if I join you?
I'll see you around, Tom
It's Mother's Day today
What?
Really?
Didn't you notice?
Didn't you notice?
Have you ever played football?
Didn't you notice?
Tom isn't much of a gentleman
Today it's quite hot
It's so cold tonight
The watch's battery ran out
Do you speak Marathi?
You'd better get back to work
Do you think that would work?
You should've waited
You've got to see Tom
You may leave us, Tom
You'll never find Tom
You'd better find Tom
Are you looking for this?
You can't park there
You can't trust them
You're just not ready
You're putting me on
You'll find out later
You're going to be late
You've got to be kidding
Do you want to discuss it?
Do you want me to do it?
You're going to like it
You can't leave here
You can't be in here
Do you think that's funny?
You're going to do just fine
You're going to do fine
Do you want me to drive?
Do you think that's bad?
Was I asleep for long?
Do you live on benefits?
My cellphone's battery is dead
I'm going to the beach
What about you?
Do you think I like this?
Do you think I can do it?
Did you do this by yourself?
Can you show it to us?
Are you sure this'll work?
Are you cool with that?
It's not as bad as all that!
Could he send us a brochure?
How are things going with you?
You've got work to do
You've got sharp eyes

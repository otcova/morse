We don't often do that
We don't have any milk
Tom told me he'd leave
We can't do that today

How did that get here?
Don't go into my room
Don't do that, please
Don't come here again
Don't bother me again
Do you grow rice, too?

I'm eating right now
I'll let the maid go
I'll do that at 2:30
I'll buy a newspaper
I'd never allow that
I'd enjoy doing that
I won't buy anything
I wasn't very scared

Did you come by boat?
Tom told me he'd try
Can you still see me?
Can I do that myself?
Are you still lonely?
Are you still eating?
Are you still coming?
Why do people snore?
Which one is my cup?
Where's the teacher?
Where should we eat?
When did that start?
What's on the table?
What's in that room?
What made you smile?
Well, let's do that
We'll sing together
We'll end with this
We wouldn't risk it
We wouldn't do that
This movie's boring
This isn't a school
This can't be eaten
Tom says he's waited
This book isn't bad
Tom said he'll laugh
Tom said he'd be out
That's a nice house
That isn't a pencil
May I shut the door?
Let's leave at 2:30
Let's go by bicycle
Let's call a doctor
It isn't cold today
Is this interesting?

How does that taste?
How did you go home?
Don't wake the baby
Tom came before 2:30
Did you drink a lot?
Did you come by car?
Did I do that right?
Can you still skate?

Can I do that again?
Tom and I didn't cry
Are you working now?
Are you still tired?
Tom's shoes are new
Are you still bored?

Tom wasn't laughing
Tom wasn't in there
Tom wasn't a farmer
Today isn't so hot
This isn't a chair
Tom was crying, too
Please don't hurry
My house isn't new
Tom swore he'd wait
Tom wouldn't make Mary do that
My book isn't here
Tom wouldn't help Mary do that
Tom wouldn't even look at Mary
Let's rest a while
Let's go to church
Tom won't likely wait for Mary
Let's eat sukiyaki
Tom won't let Mary go anywhere
Let's eat hot dogs
Let's drink coffee
Tom wasn't sure Mary was lying
Let's do that soon
Tom wasn't sure Mary was alive
It's made of paper
Tom told me he'd vote for Mary
It's in the drawer
It's begun to rain
Tom told me he didn't see Mary
It isn't hot today
Isn't that my book?
Is Boston cold now?
I'm poor at French
Tom thinks that Mary won't win
I'm happy I waited

Do you sell stamps?
Didn't you do that?
Can you still swim?
I'm sure Tom will let Mary win
Can you come early?
Are your shoes new?
Tom wasn't worried about Mary
Are you still sure?
Tom wasn't as helpful as Mary
Are you still open?
Are you still home?
Are you a Canadian?
You've got to win
Tom told me he'd talk to Mary
You can't eat now

What'll you wear?
Tom isn't very fat
Tom doesn't want Mary crying
We can't eat now
Tom isn't upstairs
This isn't paper
Tom isn't ticklish
Tom didn't have to help Mary
Tom isn't the best
Tom didn't do that
That isn't paper
Tom isn't a lawyer
Tom bet me Mary wouldn't win
Tom bet me Mary wouldn't cry
One more, please
May I go outside?
Tom and Mary don't often cry
Let's drink beer
Tom and Mary aren't here yet
Is this your cup?
Is the sky clear?
Is that a pencil?
Is that a castle?
Is it very small?
Is it cold today?
I'm very healthy
I didn't know Tom hated Mary
I'm very curious
Does Tom think Mary did that?
I'm going by car
Does Tom think Mary can swim?
I'm going by bus
Tom didn't obey me

Tom wasn't crying
Are you teachers?
Tom wasn't a hero
Are you still OK?

What did Tom buy for Mary?
Tom would've let Mary win
We didn't sing
Tom thinks Mary won't win
Tom thinks Mary won't cry
Tom has died, too
Tom thinks Mary can't win
This isn't ink
That isn't new

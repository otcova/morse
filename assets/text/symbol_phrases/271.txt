I almost didn't win
I almost cried, too
I admitted I'd lied
Did you eat dessert?
There's work to do
Tom was at my house, too
I'll be there, too
I'll be OK, I hope
I can't look at it
Tom stole Mary's bicycle
I'm not too tired
I'll visit Boston
I'll stay at home
I'll miss you all
I'll go if you go
I don't eat fruit
Let's go skating
Let's go sailing
I'll go on ahead
I don't eat eggs
I can't stop now
I can't eat that
How about Monday?
Are these for me?
Let's go skiing
Let's go rowing
I'm proud of my punctuality
I speak, therefore I am
Who owns what here?
Looking good!
We don't know how to use them
Sami's skull was never found
Sami's affair is over
Sami didn't kill anyone
Sami's conviction was upheld
Sami didn't stick to his word
Sami couldn't accept rejection
Sami's shoes were missing
Sami didn't have cancer
Sami is a ladies' man
It got better!
Tom took a high-speed train
The Dow is down 500 points
I'm sorry
I can't believe you know Tom!
Why didn't you tell me?
Hello?
Hi!
How are you?
That's my money
Don't use too much glue
Was this your idea?
What is Tom doing here?
I think you're bleeding
Mary is in her mid-twenties
Do you want some cherry pie?
Tom is tall and good-looking
I'm a vegan, but my cat isn't
Let's walk on the beach
But you're best friends.
Not anymore.
Is anyone awake?
Don't give him any sugar
You've made it to the big time
He's bitter
My car is nicer than Tom's
She's doing a great job
Did you fall asleep?
They're all sleeping
Tom's cat curled into a ball
Sami's fears became real
Sami's father is a businessman
Sami won't miss that
I'm at the car wash
I'm cold to the bone
It's eighty-five degrees here
He's outside honking his horn
She's a clever girl
I'm selling my boat
Let's drop anchor here
They're rough characters
She's the new program manager
We're headed to the fair
I'd like to drink a Coke
I'm such a fool!
What time is the movie?
Where did I put that thingie?
Is she Portuguese?
Can I have a donut?
Tom's company grew rapidly
Tom's business grew rapidly
Don't forget birthdays
I'm charging my phone
I've seen all his movies
Is this glass dirty?
I'll DJ your party
I've been having dreams lately
Did we forget our money?
Tom didn't make the team
I forgot Tom's address
I know Tom's weak points
I can't feel a thing
Do you think Tom will agree?
I'm ashamed that I did that
I won't be able to repair that
I don't have chains for my car
I'll look into that
How do you like it here?
Don't brag
It must've been very painful
Sami was under Layla's control
Sami doesn't know why
He's the best in the business
She's the best in the business
I'm so hungry right now
That's the trigger
Who is she to you?
They don't have to thank us
They don't have to say a word
You're a quick study
Don't give them any ideas
I suspect Tom won't do that
I suspect that's true
I suspect that that's true
I suspect that that isn't true
I suspect that that's not true
I suspect Tom can't do that
I suspect Tom didn't do that
I suspect Tom doesn't like me
I suspect Tom won't be coming
I suspect Tom doesn't like you
I suspect Tom won't believe me
I suspect Tom isn't happy here
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary
I suspect Tom isn't in Boston
I suspect Tom didn't do this
I suspect Tom didn't do it
I suspect Tom isn't alone
I suspect that Tom isn't alone
I suspect Tom isn't here
I suspect that Tom isn't here
Where's my order?
Burn 800 calories in the gym
He's getting a lot stronger
Sami slipped into Layla's room
Sami took Layla's cellphone
Where do you go shopping?
I'll be seeing Tom tomorrow
This car isn't mine
I'm taller than Tom is
I waited for Tom until 2:30
You should've come earlier
Let's hang out together
If I had time, I'd do that
I'd like to live here
When did you buy that?
He's so hungry in the morning
Can you make copies?
She's been very busy all week
Did it ring?
It doesn't match the Latin one
Tom is a high-roller
What's Tom doing here?
Don't worry
You'll meet someone
You could've trusted me
You could've told me
You could've drowned
You could've done it
You could've come to me
You could've been happy
I wish you could've been there
It could've been you
It could've been anyone
It could've been any one of us
I could've used that
I could've saved Tom's life
I could've prevented this
I could've lost my job
I could've helped
I could've done it by myself
I could've died tonight
I could've been killed
I could've been hurt
I could've been a star
Anyone could've made it
We would've helped them
We never would've allowed it
Tom would've told us
Tom would've told me
It would've been unbearable
It would've been fun
This is so typical of you, Tom
Tom's dog died last night
I can't stop eating figs
What extactly is that?
Is anybody awake?
Don't eat so fast
She's goddaughter
You should've worked harder
You should've woken me up
You should've stood up
You should've seen it
You should've left Tom alone
You should've kept it secret
You should've eaten more fruit
You should've done so
You should've done it earlier
It can't be helped now
You should've come to us
We should've gotten married
We should've done that
We should've been more careful
Tom should've told me earlier
Tom should've paid Mary
They should've known better
They should've intervened
You should've seen it
You should've come, too
You should've come, too
I'm not sure what's wrong
I should've told you before
I should've told someone
I should've taken the money
I should've stayed out of it
I should've read the signs
I should've brought a lunch
I really should've called
You should've warned me sooner
I should've brought a sandwich
You should've been a lawyer
Tom should've told me
Tom doesn't have any goats
How many sheep does Tom have?
Would you like to go with us?
You should've said no
You should've never doubted me
She's a good driver
Yep, you're a total nerd
What is it?
You don't look happy
Has it ever crossed your mind?
1520
Can't you see I'm busy here?
I'd be lying if I said no
Are you okay with this?
Guess what's for dinner
What was your heart rate?
Do you have any last words?
It's nice and toasty in here
Would you help me plant these?
What is for dinner tomorrow?
I said no GMO!
Is this your textbook or mine?
Tom doesn't like Mondays
What day of the month is it?
Not in a million years!
Mr. Jackson is a good teacher
Tom's house is near the river
I can't find my ticket
I must've lost it
I must've been out of my mind
I must've been pretty tired
I must've blacked out
I must've caught a cold
I must've fallen asleep
I must've left it on the bus
I must've lost it
I must've misunderstood
I must've nodded off
I must've passed out
I'm sorry, sir
It must've been a shock to you
It must've been tough for you
It must've cost a fortune
Someone must've left it there
Someone must've planted them
Something must've gone wrong
That must've been terrible
They must've been tired
They must've failed
They must've had an accident
They must've made a mistake
Tom must've seen me
Tom must've seen us
Tom must've spent a fortune
We must've missed something
What a nice car you have!
You must've paid a lot for it
You must've dropped them
You must've lost them
You must've seen them there
I can smell Mary's perfume
He must've been hungry
Tom hasn't come yet
He must've missed the bus
Why do you always do that?
Do what?
We're going to start at 2:30
What a sweet puppy!
He's an architect's architect
Were the police involved?
How do you measure that?
It's nice to be alone
They don't have to be here
What a colossal idiot!
Can I place this here?
He's full of it
Tom's rage boiled
I wasn't forced to do that
Sami's body was never found
Sami's body was identified
Sami's IQ was said to be sixty
Is your dog hypoallergenic?
Don't fixate on yourself
Why so many questions?
Are you having dizzy spells?
Are all fish cold-blooded?
Not all fish are cold-blooded
When will the concert begin?
What was the scope?
Wow, that was impressive!
When did she call?
Let them know I'll be late
When did she drop by?
Has anybody called?
What happened when I was out?
Not while I'm boss!
Anything in the mail?
What was her point?
This isn't my pen
Perhaps it'll snow tomorrow
Mary's dress is pink
It's not quite dark yet
I can't ski very well
How much do you spend a week?
These are Tom's books
These aren't Tom's books
What's that in your hands?
That's a really ugly dog
Whose house is that?
Is Tom already asleep?
Is this coat yours?
I think it’s going to snow
I'm just getting warmed up
Are corals animals or plants?
I've wanted this for so long
I'm so happy for you and Tom
I think Tom's going to faint
You mustn't do that
I'll get you!
I'm making soup
I think it's impossible
Where is the little book?
It's really very bizarre
Unfortunately, it had snowed
Tom, are we lost?
I did not!
It's just a scratch
Where are my socks?
Will this hurt?
My hat isn't new
I'll be absent for a week
I don't have a bus ticket
I don't yet have a bus ticket
I don't have a bus ticket yet
May I play with Maria?
Wake up, Tom!
Let's stay inside
Outside it's terribly cold
It's big day
I'm not able to do that alone
You'll have to help me
I'm not able to do that alone
This pleases me!
Tom is at the neighbor's house
Even so, the Earth moves!
Tom doesn't drink milk
Which woman is your aunt?
Listen!
I borrowed a friend's tent
I'm learning to do that now
I'm learning how to do that
I'm hoping you can do that
I'm the one that did that
I'm the guy that did that
I'm still able to do that
I'm paid a lot to do this
I'm old enough to do that
I'm in no rush to do that
I'm hoping we can do that
I'm going to be very late
I'm trying not to sneeze
I'm the guy who did that
I'm still doing that now
I'm ready to do that now
I'm now ready to do that
I'm motivated to do that
I'm hoping I can do that
I'm desperate to do that
I've refused to do that
I'm too sick to do that
I'm learning to do that
I'm tempted to do that
I'm not doing that now
I'm itching to do that

What an adventure!

Who's your oldest friend?
What's good in doing that?
Sami's girlfriend was Layla
I'm lucky I can still do that
I'm lucky I can do that
I'm lucky that I can do that

It isn't especially hot today
It isn't as good as it looks

I'm not sure that I trust Tom
Sami stole Layla's money
Sami is Layla's only son

I'm not used to doing that yet
I'm not tall enough to do that
I'm not rich enough to do that

I'm old enough to do that now
Tell Tom what you've done
I'm now old enough to do that

Can I eat that?
Why don't we take the stairs?
That's my favorite saying
He couldn't fix it
Give me your money!
Tom's cat has four legs
Tom's dog has four legs
It's my fault
Tom slept almost 14 hours
I'll get you a blanket
I'm not interested in dating
Have you ever had a crush?
You had a crush on me?
The screen's cracked
She's a bad influence on you
He's a bad influence on you
Speak up, Tom
I can't hear you
Tom's voice startled me
Let's redouble our efforts!
It's going to be hard to do
That's going to be hard to do
Who speaks German well?
Mary, think before you speak
Oops, sorry Mary
I'm dyslexic.
Mary, it's not
Pay together or separately?
I'm going to the shore

So, did you?
Did I what?
Kiss him of course!
Why didn't you kiss him?
Why didn't you kiss her?
I don't have a date
Tom played with Mary's cat
Tom played with Mary's dog
Tom's bird sang

You're drop dead gorgeous
What are the two of you doing?
I'm just saying
Tom's voice cracked
So, what?
It doesn't look very inviting
Is it lunchtime already?
I could tell you, but I won't
Don't look at me
I didn't tell him
Don't look at me
I didn't tell her
Loosen up, Tom
Loosen up, Tom
We're just having a little fun
He's Japanese
Who plays the piano?
Do you have a heating pad?
This music is lo-fi
Does your job pay well?
How old are your sisters?
How old are your brothers?
What's your neighborhood like?
I've never traveled abroad
Do you like to listen to jazz?
Leave me alone, Tom and Mary
I'm stronger
I'm stronger than him
Tom's house has a tiny kitchen
Tom has a master’s degree
Sit down fast, kids
I do not scream!
It's all us
He's an Esperantist
It's a pleasant evening
I'm weary
I'm tired of salads
He's certainly attentive
Shut 'er down
It costs 3000 Japanese yen
I'm hiding in Japan
Here is your dog!
Be careful, dog biting!
It's their dog?
It was too sweet!
Good night, sweet dreams!
Clear progress!

Tom isn't just my brother
He's my best friend, too
Mary isn't just my sister
She's my best friend, too
I'm not sure that I can do it
You're a waste of space
He's not my boyfriend
He's just my friend
She's not my girlfriend
She's just my friend
You don't know?
Don't know what?
What did Tom lose?
When did you lose your keys?
How often do you lose things?
Where are the plates arranged?
Wash your plate, please
How do I get to your house?
This plate isn't clean
These plates aren't clean
This is Tom's plate
Is it OK if I come in?
Is it all right if I come in?
Can I come, too?
Is it OK if I come?
Is it all right if I come?
May I go, too?
Is it OK if I go?
Is it all right if I go?
Will you be able to come?
That's all I can do for now
What do you want to become?
I don't like goat cheese
I'm ashamed of my behavior
Would the kids eat fish?
Would they drink water?
When would you be here?
A: "Maybe you like him?
B: "No way!
What are you saying?
Stop joking around!
Let's wait a bit!
What did Maria write?
Nothing important.
Tom's identity was stolen
But it's good
It's not too spicy?
Mary is in her mid-forties
I saw a UFO!
I'm serious!
Please, believe me
It's my responsibility
Do you still trust your wife?
Drop those pigs!
Just let me act!
Is it too spicy?
It's not too spicy, is it?
Who gave you those flowers?
Who gave those flowers to you?

Get married already!
Sami didn't know what to do
Sami's killer was caught

Sami hasn't modelled in years
Sami won't win this game
Sami's needle contained poison
I'm not sure I like it
I'm sure Tom can do that again
I'm not sure that I like this
I'm sure Tom should do that
I'm not sure that I trust you
I'm not sure that I understand
I'm not sure that I want that
I'm not sure that I'm ready
I'm not sure that it's real
I'm not sure that that's true
Sami can't afford this
I'm not sure that you're ready
I'm positive I can do that
I'm sure I can do that again
I'm sure that I can do that
I'm sure you can do that again
I'm unlikely to do that again
I'm very glad I didn't do that
He's dead
Now you've really done it!
Are you going to cry now?
St. Mark’s Square is flooded
This isn't going to end well
Tom is Mary's butler
Mary is a make-up artist
How could anyone be so cruel?
Now you see me, now you don't
This must have cost a fortune!
Look, Mary
Don't tailgate this truck
How can we defend ourselves?
There's no question
I'm studying geology
Who wrote this text?
Do you like Mozartkugeln?
It's almost Christmas!
Fuck your guys's opinion
Where did you put my gloves?
Go get my hat!
This is not his hat?
Sami's lover met his wife
Sami raised Layla's baby
I love Roquefort cheese.
Me, I hate that.
It's clear he loves it
I love this actor!
I hate him.
Do you want to sign it?
I'm going to eat a banana
Sami couldn't contain his rage
I can't stop eating dried figs
Sami didn't learn his lesson
Sami called his ex-girlfriend
This isn't my hat
This isn't Tom's hat
This isn't Tom's hat, is it?
Why was Tom angry yesterday?
I'd be like swish-swish-smash!
Who's taller?
Do you know that boy's name?
Are these your books?
It's me
Can I come in?
Sami can't forget it
Because it's for dogs only!
Duh!" replied Tom
I'll be free after 2:30
I've been sick all week
Sami vandalized Layla's desk
I'll eat whatever Tom cooks
I'm sure Tom did his best
Don't open this window
Where do you suppose Tom went?
Sami's volcano blew
How long did you work today?
I'm here and ready
I'd like to live on a farm
Do you love my mother?
Who created this oil painting?
It's getting warmer
Let's open all the windows
Tom's train arrives at 2:30
I'll be meeting Tom at 2:30
Sami beheaded Layla's body
What time should I call you?
We don't get much rain here
We don't get much snow here
Does Tom play the piano?
Do you play the saxophone?
I'd rather stay at home today
Who are you?
Tom.
We don't understand each other
Fishing isn't allowed here
There isn't any ice cream left
There isn't any cake left
I don't know a word of French
There's not much coffee left
My apartment isn't very large
I think I'm going to be late
I can't get this door unlocked
I'm glad you enjoyed the party
This glass isn't mine
I bought this jacket for $30
This is a present for you?
Tom wasn't at school yesterday
I don't know any of those boys
Why have you come?
I promise I'll find you a job
Sami's family supported Layla
Sami was frightened, too
Sami's eye was split in half
Sami didn't want to come in
Sami didn't call Layla back
Sami's business skyrocketted
Sami's marriage has just ended
Sami didn't respond for days
Sami won't answer my calls
Marie's sister is a Berliner
Holy hell!
Tom's home looks like a castle
There's nothing to see here
She has a bit of a temper.
I've noticed.
Surely you can't be serious
Mom, he's kicking me!
Who's your mother-in-law?
Could I have a dark beer?
My car is nicer than Tom's car
It wasn't Tom who did that
I'd never lend Tom any money
Sami's gun was stolen from him
Sami wouldn't have done that
Sami saw a gun by Layla's hand
Where can I park the car?
Sami doesn't recall anything
Sami decided Layla's fate
Do you speak Kurdish?
Do you know the rules?
How on earth did Tom do that?
Why did Tom eat that?
It almost didn't happen
That almost didn't happen
We almost didn't do that
These bananas aren't ripe
Tom is going to go, too
Is there anybody in the pool?
Is there anyone in the pool?
Make way!
Start shoveling coal, men!
What's her top speed?
Do you think plants feel pain?
When will the rain stop?
When did it stop raining?
Did it rain all night?
It's good teamwork again
I can't stay awake
Sami didn't do anything
I'm not like them
Who are you saying that to?
Hurry up!
We're late
Of course!
Two more beers, please!
Do you know how to get rich?
It's cloudy again
It couldn't be better
You're a woman, not a man

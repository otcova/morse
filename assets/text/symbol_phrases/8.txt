How do you play this game?
I'm not a servant
Is anyone fluent in Latin?
I'll try to eat it in one bite
It's now time to eat
Tom wasn't acting on his own
Now it's time to get to work
Tom isn't a good juggler
It didn't work out that well
Tom wasn't wearing a hoodie
Tom isn't awake, is he?
Tom wasn't drunk that night

Why aren't you still working?
Don't come here now
Don't come here any more

Tom wasn't supposed to come
We've all got to work together
It's not prohibited by law
Tom wasn't a patient of mine
Tom isn't a suspect, is he?
It doesn't work for everyone
Tom isn't worried, is he?
Do you often think about her?
It hasn't happened to me yet
It didn't work as advertised
It'll all work out in the end
Tom wasn't eating a sandwich
Will you be able to do this?
We don't have to work together
No, that can't be it
This is good; I love this
I still don't really know
In this life..
When have you been happy?
Tom isn't mad at us, is he?
Tom wasn't dressed in black
Is it normal to be scared?
It's normal to be scared
Don't worry
My place is so tiny!
That didn't work out very well
Tom wasn't hard to convince
Tom wasn't happy about that
Tom's brother is smart
Did you wash these apples?
Tom wasn't wearing black socks
Did you wash this apple?
Tom wasn't my boyfriend then
I'll finish the work in a week
Tom wasn't as nervous as I was
Tom won't find out what we did
Tom wasn't in Boston with me
It's too cold now

Tom wasn't waiting at the gate
May I talk to you in private?
Tom wasn't given antibiotics
Tom wasn't asleep at that time
Tom wouldn't even talk to Mary
Tom's mask is out of fashion
Tom wasn't here this afternoon
They're not helping
Tom was angry, and so was Mary
Tom wasn't ever the same again
Where did you take Tom?
Tom wasn't mistaken, was he?
Does this house belong to you?
Tom won't need anybody's help
Tom wasn't here the whole time
I hear you're not well
Tom wasn't the first one there
When will this start?
We don't meet anyone by chance
Since when are you in Japan?
Tom wasn't in a very good mood
Don't yell at Tom!
It couldn't get any worse
Why are you here again?
We've already met everybody

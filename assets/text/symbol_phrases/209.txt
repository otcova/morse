Did you learn that from Tom?
Why are we waiting for Tom?
Could you help me find Tom?
Do you want to call Tom?

Where were you Monday night?
Did Tom call you last night?
How did things go last night?
Were you working last night?
That would've been very nice
Why are you being so nice?
Why can't you just be nice?
So what's the good news?
It's nice to feel needed
That's not really necessary
That isn't really necessary
That's no longer necessary
It's no longer necessary

It'll only take three minutes
It'll only take a few minutes
It'll take a few minutes
I'll just be a couple minutes
Could you excuse us a minute?
Would you hold on a minute?
Could you hold on a minute?
This'll only take a minute

What do these symbols mean?
What's Tom got against me?
Were you concerned about me?
What seems to be the matter?
This isn't a joking matter
Tom didn't apologize to Mary
Tom didn't even see Mary
Why is Tom so afraid of Mary?
Maybe Tom didn't notice Mary
Why's Tom mad at Mary?

That's my decision to make
It's an easy mistake to make
Tom didn't seem mad
When was this decision made?
When did you two fall in love?
Tom doesn't study a lot
What makes you think I'm lost?
Tom found the watch he'd lost
There isn't a moment to lose
What makes you think I'd lose?
Maybe there's a loophole

It's riskier than it looks
Where do we start looking?
Well, let's have a look
Has Tom been waiting long?
This shouldn't take very long

Did you complain about it?
Do you ever think about it?
What does Tom think about it?
Do you know how old Tom is?

What do you figure this is?
Do you even know what that is?
Isn't that the way it is?
What department are you in?
There's no other way in
Why wasn't Tom invited?
Why wasn't I invited?
What am I getting myself into?
It wasn't a job interview
It's warmer in the house
Let's go inside
Are you ready to come inside?
Spiders aren't insects
Do you mind if we come in?
It's really quite impressive
It's not very important
It's very, very important
It's really not important
What exactly are you implying?
I never had a chance, did I?
That's a very intriguing idea

Where did she buy books?
She's by far the tallest girl
How long are you going to be?
That's an old hat
That's old hat
3-D movies are old hat
That's last year's snow
That's yesterday's news
I read; you write
What happened to my bag?
She's called Dilma
No context, no text
He didn't see anything
What, Snuffles?
Dangerous?
It's that time again already
It never rains, it pours
Where is my brother?
I'll take that as a yes
Hello, is there anybody there?
Hello?
Anyone there?
Hello, is there anyone there?
I'll put in a word for you
Did you do it?
How come the sky is blue?
You are lazy!
Phillip isn't an engineer
What is this thing for?
You'd better not see her now

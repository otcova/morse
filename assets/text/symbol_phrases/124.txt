You're not listening to me
You're not dead yet
You're creative
You're being paranoid
You're a traitor
You'd better stay with me
You'd better sit here
You do that and I'll fire you
You aren't my mother
Would you like to come in?
Why would I know that?
Why don't you ever cook?
Why did you lock the door?
Why did you change your mind?
Why are you all here?
Whose suitcase is that?
Who said I stole the money?
Who said I had a gun?
Who do we owe money to?
Where've you been?
Where's the butter?
Where did you hear that story?
Where did you go to school?
Where did everybody go?
Where are my parents?
When did you notice that?
When did that happen?
When can you start?
What's the matter with you?
What's in the bucket?
What'd I do?
What was it?
What is it you want most?
What if they don't like me?
What happens now?
What exactly don't you get?
What else can go wrong?
What does it look like?
What do you see?
What do you call this?
What do these markings mean?
What did I miss?
What are you watching?
What are you going to do next?
What am I going to do?
We're still shopping around
We're home
We're done
We'll talk about this later
We'll figure something out
We sure had fun, didn't we?
We don't have to go
They're waiting for you
They're mad at you
They'll be fine
They can't push us around
There's no way out
That's no good
That's my wish
That's mine
That's amazing
That's a good point
Something's missing
Please don't go away
Nobody's going to hurt you
Nobody's ever heard of him
Mary's my niece
Mary's in there
Mary's confused
Let's talk about this later
Let's take the short cut
Let's put it to a vote
Let's hit the showers
Let's do this properly
Let's clean up this mess
It's time for school
It's a pleasure to meet you
Isn't that right?
Is anyone hurt?
I've never seen you like this
I've learned to cook
I've done it
I've been there before
I'm your best friend
I'm willing to apologize
I'm trying to talk to you
I'm still shopping around
I'm not selling you my car
I'm not married
I'm not going to touch it
I'm not going to hurt you
I'm not coming back
I'm not coming back here
I'm looking for someone
I'm hitting the road
I'm going to start over
I'm going to miss you
I'm going to miss you, too
I'll tell you what's wrong
I'll show you how to do it
I'll set you free
I'll prove it to you
I'll pick you up after school
I'll help you pack
I'll get rid of them
I'll get back to you
I'll do it with you
I'll call them
I'll ask him
I'd like to talk to you
I wouldn't do that
I think you're nuts
I still don't get it
I just don't believe it
I hope I'm not interrupting
I don't want to go
I don't want them to go away
I don't understand it
I don't really have a gun
I don't really have a cold
I don't need this anymore
I don't know where I'm going
I don't know how to drive
I don't care if you're busy
I don't believe it
I didn't see you
I didn't even know his name
I didn't cheat
I didn't break it
I can't wait till summer
I can't see
I can't go in there
I can't do it right away
I bet you didn't know that
How's your old lady doing?
How much does the job pay?
How late do you stay open?
Have a seat, won't you?
Don't you get it?
Do you want me to leave?
Do you trust me?
Do you think I'm healthy?
Do you smell something?
Do you remember how we met?
Do I have a choice?
Do you have some wine?
Did you see what I did?
Did you hear it too?
Did you have fun last night?
Did you drop it?
Can you pitch?
Can you hear us?
Aren't those your parents?
Are you up?
Are you sure you're not tired?
Are you here alone?
Are you going to eat that?
Are you getting tired?
Are you a ghost?
He's a community leader
I've never told anyone
It's easier than it sounds
I'm at your disposal
He isn't at home
Zilch.
Training.
See that stone?
Let's do our job
I'm buying
Are you sad?
Why would I be?
Are you and Tom enemies?
Why would we be?
Don't kill me
Don't be crazy
Don't be sorry
Don't be upset
Don't forget
Don't make a sound
Don't push me
Don't say anything
Don't let Tom eat this
Can I know where you work?
Could you lend me a hand?
Give him a big hand!
What's the benefit of this?
I've learnt to cook
She's the most beautiful woman
Have you seen Tom?
Not in the last few days.
I didn't get any of that
Tom's dog's name is Cookie
Tell me what's going on
Hold your applause, please
Don't walk away from me
Don't say that word ever again
Don't repeat that
Don't read my journal
Don't read my diary
Don't look at me
Don't go in my room
Don't drink the water
Don't come any closer
Don't call me again
Don't be a stranger
I'll never ever do that again!
I'll have what he's having
I'll have the same
What's his track record like?
You've earned it
Who's been eating my peanuts?
Let's get something to eat
It's a nice day to eat outside
I'm really hungry
I haven't eaten all week
I'm not eating this
I'm getting kind of hungry
Let's go get something to eat
I'll cook it if you eat it
I haven't eaten in four days
It's plastic
Do you eat lunch at your desk?
Did anybody eat with you?
Elephants can't ride a bicycle
Do ants have ears?
He's a powerful demon
She's a powerful demon
She's a demoness
Somebody's at the door
He's jealous and irrational
She's jealous and irrational
He's young and energetic
She's young and energetic
Hey guys!
I've got some good news
I've got some bad news
He doesn't care about money
She doesn't care about money
Don't look at me like that
She doesn't love me anymore
He's a Jewish American
He's an African American
She's an African American
She's a Jewish American
You're sexually repressed
He's sexually repressed
She's sexually repressed
He's a prude
She's a prude
The party's over
He used a fake I.D
She used a fake I.D
It's the cops!
She's obviously drunk
It's insanely complex
She's a member of a sorority
He's a frat boy
Your fly is open!
Don't tell my wife
Don't tell my girlfriend
Don't tell my boyfriend
Don't tell my husband
You're a nervous wreck
He's a nervous wreck
She's a nervous wreck
I don’t like any of this
There wasn't anyone there
How did you sleep last night?
Don't trust Tom
Tell me what we're doing here
Promise me you'll be careful
Don't touch me
Don't tempt me
Don't tell me what to do
Don't rub it in
Don't resist us
Don't remind me
Don't leave us
Don't follow me
Don't ever talk to me again
Don't disappear on me again
Don't be so shy
Cut that out!
I'm the middle child of three
We have to do this now.
There's no time.
How're you doing?
How's that again?
This one's on me
Why are you mad with me?
Nope, not at all
Why are you mad at me?
Why should I go to school?
To the bird, the dog exists
Hey cat, how are you?
Are you sitting in the house?
It's a new year
You're sick
I'm letting you go
I'm laying you off
I'm firing you
I'm allowing you to go
I'll allow you to go
I'll permit you to go
Where is the cat?
She's an angel
I didn't do anything!
I can't leave now
She's cruel and heartless
He's cruel and heartless
Are we leaving?
Are we leaving soon?
Hurry up!
I don't have all day
We don't have all day
Just don't drop it
Get out of here now!
Send us lots of pictures!
Don't try to stop me
Let me see what's in your hand
Get some sleep, okay?
Don't wait up for me
Don't admit anything
I'm giving up before I start
Who pronounced this sentence?
Man, I'm hungry
Gosh, I'm hungry
Does that clock work?
I see you're at it again
It's a school night
He's playing with my cat
She's playing with her cat
It's a remake
You know what I'm saying?
She won't know
He won't know
I'm not sure if he saw it
I'm not sure if she saw it
Tom isn't sure what to do
I'm not sure where Tom will go
I'm not sure what Tom will do
I'm not sure if Tom will go
I'm not sure if I'll go
I'm not sure how to do this
It's very confusing
It's very interesting
But I'll do it
It's not cheap
She's really cute
It's hard to tell
He's a good guy
It's worthless junk
She's looking at me
He's looking at me
Tom's room was very small
What is your dream?
I didn't feel like a giant
I felt very, very small
I don't want kids
He doesn't want kids
She doesn't want kids
He married a farmer's daughter
It's a lot of work
I'd like that
I don't want anyone to see it
How will you stop me?
How will you stop him?
How will you stop her?
How will you stop them?
I'm sorry
She's a very talented artist
You can't just leave me here
Don't be foolish
I'll explain everything
I'd like that.
I'd like that.
I'd like that.
Let me hug you.
I'd like that a lot.
May I kiss you?
I'd like that very much.
Let me buy you lunch.
I'd like that.
Yes, I'd like that very much.
I'd like that very much.
You're wrong
Do you still love her?
Do you still love him?
You're not thinking clearly
We can't turn back
We can't turn back now
He's good
She's good
I'm sorry I yelled at you
I'm sorry I hurt you
He's addicted to drugs
She's addicted to drugs
Will you accompany me?
Please help me!
She's my half-sister
He's my half-brother
It's not enough
I'm not good at this
I'm doing my best
He's doing his best
She's doing her best
Here's a dollar
Go and buy a cup of coffee.
That's not enough.
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm still thinking about it
Don't do this to me!
I'm begging you
I'll do anything you want!
She's pregnant with twins
Do you like my new haircut?
I don't need an SUV
“Whom do you love?”
It is said that..
School is a challenge already?
Only a few days are left!
Why are you not doing it?
My daughter won't listen to me
My son won't listen to me
Let's keep this a secret, OK?
You tricked me!
Nice shot!
Enjoy your life, while you can
Do the best you can!
Is this art?
Who owns Africa's resources?
Why is the light on?
Let the concert begin!
Nobody beats him!
That's why the boss hired me.
I'll take my chances.
You need to pay a fee.
What kind of fee?
You know Tom, don't you?
I can't say that I do.
What kind of cake?
Would you like a drink?
I've already got one.
Will you go?
I will if I have to.
I'll try to be there.
Something came up.
Why didn't you kiss Mary?
She wouldn't let me.
Why did you do that?
I had no choice.
Which apple would you like?
I'd like that one.
Where's Tom?
How would I know?
Where's my hat?
Right behind you.
Where are Tom and Mary?
They're on their way.
When should we tell Tom this?
Now is the best time.
When did it happen?
When did what happen?
What's your decision?
Can I sleep on it?
What's Tom doing now?
You don't want to know.
What were you just doing?
I was talking to Tom.
I'm not sure yet.
It was okay, I guess.
What color is your underwear?
I'm not wearing any.
We'd like a beer.
Just one beer?
Oh, was that tonight?
Has it been that long?
That's not an option.
We have a problem.
What sort of problem?
That's good to know.
Tom will probably be late.
Yes, that's a possibility.
You'd better hope so.
Tom will buy that painting.
How can you be sure?
How did he do that?
Tom stole my wallet.
Are you sure about that?
That's pretty close.
Tom likes Mary.
Yeah, I know.
Tom likes Mary.
Tom likes Mary.
Tom is thirty years old.
Tom isn't here.
Then where is he?
Tom is getting married.
Who's the lucky girl?
Tom is a great guy.
Tom got a new job.
What kind of job?
That's really sweet.
That's nice to hear.
Tom and Mary have broken up.
That's ancient history.
Really?
I had no idea.
I wasn't aware of that.
This isn't Tom's watch.
I never said it was.
This isn't mine.
It's not mine either.
The boys went downtown.
Is that where Tom is?
That's not the problem.
Then what's wrong?
Think about what?
Please put this on the top.
On top of what?
Please be on time.
I always am, aren't I?
Who's not coming?
May I borrow Tom's lawn mower?
I guess it would be all right.
Look what I just bought.
What is it?
Let's go dancing.
What a great idea!
That's a great idea.
I'd appreciate that.
Jump across the ditch.
I will if you will.
It's really muggy today.
You're not kidding.
I'm sorry
I can't do that anymore.
Can't do what anymore?
I miss you already.
I'm looking for a guy.
I'm a guy, aren't I?
I'm glad I studied karate.
I'm glad you did, too.
Maybe I was wrong.
No one asked you.
I think Tom stole my drink.
Really?
I think Tom likes Mary.
Isn't that obvious?
I've had better.
I think it's Tom at the door.
Who else would it be?
That would be unwise.
I met the new teacher.
What's he like?
That's the rumor.
Stop me from doing what?
I have many things for sale.
What kind of things?
I gave them the job.
Why them and not us?
You should make time.
I can't figure this out.
That makes two of us.
Then just do what you can.
You assume wrong.
I'll offer him money.
How was the survival camp?
I only lasted two days.
How much money does Tom make?
How would I know?
Many, many times.
How did the meeting go?
I think it went okay.
Here's your confession.
I'm not signing that.
Here are the divorce papers.
I'm not signing them.
Here are some flowers for you.
They're gorgeous.
I always do, don't I?
It's too soon to tell.
Do you like the way Tom sings?
Don't you?
Do you like strawberries?
I love them.
Do you know Tom?
I don't believe I do.
There was no time.
Not in so many words.
Did Tom really hit Mary?
That's what I heard.
Did giving Tom the money help?
I don't think it did.
What kind of book?
Questions about what?
No problem.
Can I get you a beer?
Do you have anything stronger?
Are you upset?
Why would I be?
Are you going to Tom's party?
I'm still not sure.
I most certainly am.
I can guarantee it.
Tom broke up with Mary.
Is that a bad thing?
I already tried that.
How did you two meet?
It's a long story.
Have you paid your bill yet?
We most certainly have.
What kind of fish is that?
Don't even think about it
This is really bad luck!
How old is your sister?
Don't bring bad luck
Don't take any prisoners
He doesn't speak my language
Don't worry
We won't fail this time
Don't worry
Don't worry
Don't worry
It's easy
Don't worry
It'll be over soon
Don't worry
Don't worry
I'll take care of Tom
Don't worry
I'll protect you
Don't worry
I'll never leave you
Don't worry
I'll be discreet
Don't worry
I won't tell anyone
Don't worry
Don't worry
I won't hurt her
Don't worry
I promise I'll do what you ask
Don't worry
Don't worry about Tom
He isn't a threat
Don't worry about Tom
Don't worry about the store
I'll lock up
Don't worry about me
Don't worry about me so much
Don't worry about it
Everything's going to be fine
Don't worry about it, OK?
Don't worry about a thing
Don't waste your time
Don't waste Tom's time
Don't wait for me for dinner
Don't try to talk
Don't touch those
Don't touch that
It's evidence
Don't touch that dial
Don't touch my stuff
Don't throw them away
You'll need them later
Don't throw that away
Don't thank me yet
Don't tempt me
Don't tell anyone
Don't talk to Tom about this
Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me like that
Don't take any chances
Don't stay up too late
Tomorrow's a school day
Don't speak French to me
Don't sound so surprised
Don't sleep in the bathtub
Don't sit there
That's Tom's chair
Don't sass me
Don't respond to that
Don't play games with me
Don't move unless I tell you
Don't mind me

Don't go anywhere just yet
Don't gloat
Don't give Tom any ideas
Don't give me that look
Don't get too comfortable
Don't get paranoid
Don't get mad, promise
Don't get all tied up in knots
Don't get all high and mighty
Don't forget your bag
Don't forget to tell Tom
Don't forget to floss
Don't forget our date tomorrow
Don't flatter yourself
Don't fight it
Don't feel bad
Don't expect overtime
Don't ever say her name
Don't ever lie to me again
Don't ever call me again
Don't even think of it
Don't even think about it
Don't drink that
Don't drink out of my glass
Don't drag me into this
Don't dodge the question
Don't do this
Don't do it
Don't do anything stupid, OK?
Don't die
Don't count on Tom's help

I'm just the janitor
Don't act surprised
Tell Tom it's an emergency
Tell Tom I'm ready
Tell Tom I won't need his help
Tell me you're kidding
Tell me why you didn't ask Tom
Tell me this isn't happening
It's cold today
Take care of yourself, OK?
It's likely to rain
Stop what you're doing
Stop right there, please
Stop or I'll shoot
I'm fine
Let me handle Tom, OK?
You're my father?
Let me ask you something, Tom
Let go or I'll scream
I'll get it done right away
I don't want it
Keep it down, will you?
Just pretend I'm not here
Just don't tell Tom
Just don't tell Tom I sent you
Just don't pierce anything
Just don't break anything
Tell her she's beautiful
Just be glad you're OK
Just be careful, Tom
Hurry!
Tom says it's urgent
Get the door, will you?
Fill this out, please
Come on, sing with me
Come on, give it to me
Come on, Tom
Call me when you're ready
Call me when it's done
Louie, your friends are coming
I can't take that last step
I don't live in Finland
Do you think it's gone bad?
Can we have a moment alone?
She's a night owl
He's an early bird
It's not unheard of
She's wearing tights
It's good for business
Don't be nervous
What is the soil food web?
My aunt's pen is full of ink
I'll never do that again
I'll never ever do that again
He's rich as Croesus
How did his son die?
Do as I say, not as I do
If I were rich, I would buy it
How horrible!
He's his own boss
She's her own boss
I'm my own boss
I'm still on the fence
It's a wonderful world
He's not the right man for you
He's not the right man for me
It's too late for him
It's too late for her
It's too late for you
He's autistic
It's the same every time
Mayday, mayday!
It's hidden under the bed
We're working for you
How horrible!
SOS!
SOS!
SOS!
It's 3:10
Good morning!
Where do you want to go?
Elephants can't ride bicycles
One day you'll understand
He's depressed and lonely
She says that she's lonely
Were you crying?
Can you explain your answer?
Don't be naive
That's adorable
Get a grip on yourself!
She's a bitch
Is there a student discount?
It's now or never
With pleasure, my dear
No smoking!
I don't like these sweets
You didn't say anything
It isn't as bad as it seems
At that time, he was a student
With pleasure, my dear.
I'd be glad to.
Are you drinking green tea?

Tom shouldn't have told me
Tom shouldn't have done that
Tom should've been here by now
Tom says he can't sleep
Tom said he'd call at 2:30

I dare my parents to do this!
Could I get that in writing?
We must make it!
We have to make it!
Is that your mother?
Anybody knows who Florence is?
Which album could it be?
Would you do me a favour?
She's meditating
It's a brain-teaser
She's a desperate housewife
You've got to be kidding!
She doesn't like it here
I don't want to be rich
You like me, don't you?
Why don't you like me?
There's some truth to this
We weren't doing anything!
Do you have an alibi?
We're just friends
He's stupid and arrogant
Can you spare a minute?
You're not making any sense
It's virtually impossible
I'd be happy to show it to you
It's part of the job
What are you unhappy about?
What do tigers eat?
Don't sleep long
Why are my students lazy?
Why do you go to bed late?
Work won't come to you
What is the time?
It is twenty minutes to three.
He's an unlucky guy
Be pretty and shut up!
Praise be to Allah!
We allow it!

Are you an athlete?
No, I'm a fan.
Go faster!
Walk faster!
That isn't a bad story
In what way?
That isn't news
That's not necessary at all
That isn't a lie
Let's have a coffee.
I'm sorry, but I have to leave
Tom didn't count the money
It's true that Tom did that
You're very sly
I'm not his girlfriend
Can I drink some water?
He's obsessed with money
Dad, which is my left hand?
That isn't my umbrella
This table's larger
That isn't what they're after
That isn't common knowledge
That isn't Tom's choice
That isn't appropriate
That isn't such a bad deal
That isn't all I learned
Tom didn't realize that
That isn't an issue
That isn't very nice, is it?
That isn't wrong
That isn't what you said
Tom isn't very muscular
I'm from Chile
Where are you from?
What did we lose?
Why shouldn't I?
I'm a student
How about you?
Tom didn't need a hammer
That isn't our fault
Let's say I fix the pipe
How much will you pay me?
Hopefully, nobody protests
That isn't the reason
That isn't our policy
I wonder if he's still married
When will I eat Kiwi?
That isn't the right word
That's not a fir tree
That isn't all I have to do
I couldn't look her in the eye
That isn't very reassuring
That's not Tom's choice
That isn't the best answer
Tom hasn't answered yet
That's not much, is it?
That isn't a valid comparison
Cats don't like chocolate
Tom left the library at 2:30
That isn't my object
That isn't a very good idea
We don't need credit from you
That isn't difficult to do
Allergies.
The red bicycle is Tom's
That isn't very clever
Do you want to work in Boston?
It's late
You're talking nonsense
That's not wine
It's only grape juice
That isn't true at all
Do you teach Esperanto?
I'm Tom, and you?
That isn't meant to happen
Tom didn't punch me
That isn't what I intended
That's not my daughter
That isn't such a good idea
That's not why I did this
That's not paper
That isn't my point
That isn't how I understood it
Tom didn't get any presents
That isn't so serious
How come you became a furry?
Why did you become a furry?
How did you become a furry?
I'm glad I met Tom
That isn't a bad start
You call yourself a debater?
What's your personality type?
Your logic doesn't follow
I'm getting better at this
I can't stand Tom's face
That's not logical
That isn't too smart
That isn't fun
That isn't an insult
Tom didn't work there
That's a grapevine
Happy birthday, Karl Marx!
That isn't all we did
I'm nonbinary
Are you nonbinary?
They're nonbinary
Other Tom.
That's not what I do
Is anybody fluent in Latin?
There isn't anybody
Isn't anybody interested?
Does anybody else feel hot?
Why should anybody trust it?
Does anybody know where he is?
That isn't why
Would anyone like more soup?
There's nobody
Nobody's gotten it yet
Nobody's perfect at it
There's nobody with us
There's nobody at the entrance
That isn't the entire story
You can't go in his room
Ali is an anarcho-capitalist
How old are you?
I haven't lived.
Do you promise?
Yes, I promise.
Promise?
Yes, I promise.
I don't think he's alone
I don't think she's alone
I don't think you'll be alone
He's honest to the bone
That isn't the last of it
That isn't going to be enough
Tom didn't sneeze
Is my room still empty?
That isn't Tom's only secret
Who's seen me?
Is your shirt white?
That isn't OK
One doesn't say such things!
Can I be frank?
Mom, are we there yet?
Where is my rose-colored bag?
That isn't the actual plan
Tom doesn’t want any kids
Where were you guys?
Maria is a woman, not a child
Why am I always hungry?
Careful; watch out for snakes!
Tom didn't get the hint
That isn't what I'm saying
Was the water very hot?
You are very romantic!
Do you know who we are, Tom?
It’s tomato soup
That isn't very friendly
That's not very clever
He doesn't stop talking
C'est la vie!
That's life!
C'est la vie
It's all in the past
It's fun playing in the waves
You're not there anymore
She's not in your life anymore
She can't hurt you anymore
He can't hurt you anymore
He's not in your life anymore
I'm such a weirdo
I don't feel lonely anymore
Where do you wash your hands?
You can't sleep on my bed
I'm not talking to you anymore
You'd better leave
It's getting late
How old does my brother look?
I was sure you'd come
Did you catch the news today?
Don't argue with a mirror
What do you think of him?
Can I drink a glass of milk?
I'm as hungry as a wolf
It's siesta time
I'm going to file a complaint
What's Mary selling?
Don't learn it by memorizing
There's no path to peace
You expect me to believe you?
Tom didn't want that at all
We didn't have much to give
I'm coming home at half two
Yanni's hands are disgusting
Yanni's hands are now clean
Yanni's hands are always clean
Yanni's hands smell of vomit
Let's learn addition below ten
Yanni's hands are clean
Yanni's hands smell of poop
Yanni doesn't wash his hands
Yanni's hands are smelly
Yanni's hands are dry
Yanni's hands crack
That's what Yanni prefers
I didn't like being married
Yanni saw Skura's feet
Where is the oil drain plug?
Yanni's car is sitting there
Yanni's car is cold
This is a one-time use gasket
Yanni didn't start the engine
Yanni doesn't have to add oil
I can't believe it
Where did you find this, Tom?
What do you need?
What do you have?
Educate me, O Enlightened One
Mary likes you!
It's absolutely haram
She's just my type
We don't know anyone in London
Who took the car?
She's blind in her right eye
Mary doesn't wear jewelry
Tom didn't let me help Mary
Tom didn't tell his parents
I didn't know Tom was fasting
We've had our say
Tom didn't take his tie off
Tom didn't take off his tie
What's he sitting on?
She's Greek
Is everyone agreed?
Does everyone agree with that?
Come down for your food!
Come downstairs for your meal!
Do you have insomnia?
Who could that be?
I think it's Tom.
Does that help you at all?
It's enough to drive you mad!
She's aware of her mistakes
Shall we have a game of chess?
Shall we play a game of chess?
Single or return?
Single, please.
That's not your fault at all
Do you see those two bends?
Can you see the two bends?
He's refusing to meet him
I wonder if it'll rain
It'll be worse tomorrow
She'd have to go there as well
They're not able to say that
They're unable to say that
He's on the road to recovery
Why didn't you ring me before?
When did you become ill?
When did you get ill?
Where's my teaspoon?
Where are you going?
I've had enough, Yanni
I'm leaving.
Go ahead and see if I care.
I know you don't care
Goodbye.
You know what, Skura?
Go to hell!
Do you hear me?
Go to hell!
Yanni didn't really mean it
How dare you tell Yanni that?
Oh God!
He's driving me crazy!
Actually, Yanni hit Skura
Yanni.
Not now, honey.
Yanni's diaper is on the couch
I'm glad I didn't ask
After all, Yanni is the driver
Just bring me some coffee.
Your wish is my command.
Sami won't start crying
No, she didn't do this
Can you keep secrets?
Yes.
Me too.
I'm not stalking you
You have no self-respect
It's a one-sided conflict
Tom isn't a joiner
We're out of toner
That's not silver
That isn't silver
I'm the Queen of Antarctica
You're gorgeous.
Why do people say that?
I'm not.
Tom's the decoy
Let's all just eat together
Who are you in the photo?
Does he have a minute?
Does she have a minute?
They don't like the train
He doesn't like the train
She doesn't like the train
Come here, kid
I don't wish for money
What they said wasn't true
What you said wasn't true
It wasn't Tom who set us up
Who set Tom's cabin on fire?
Tom's trial is set for October
We aren't set up to do that
We're not set up to do that
It's time we set some limits
A hearing date hasn't been set
The mob set fire to Tom's car
A new deadline hasn't been set
Don't get too set in your ways
Rigor mortis hasn't yet set in
We're here to set things right
Don't eat us
Screw them!
Don't you want a bit more tea?
She's not what she seems
Tom set Mary's house on fire
Where did you set your traps?
I'm dropping out of college
Do you speak Limburgish?
You're so brave!
It's a lie
I'm a Lebanese citizen
Did you hear what she said?
I won't accept your gift
I'm going to Shanghai tomorrow
Eat this bread!
Did that actually happen?
Did you shave your eyebrows?
Are you ready?
Not yet.
Wounds made with words don't
You know what drives me crazy?
Why get mad at the devil?
Don't mention it, sweetheart
Don’t listen to her
He’s told you no
She’s told you no
He’s told you to not
She’s told you to not
Maybe Mary doesn’t clean it
I’m tired and my head hurts
I’m a beginner-level student
You know that it’s our duty
Enjoy your meal, everyone!
Maybe they hadn’t won the game
Give me the bucket, quick!
Wow, what a fast horse!
Has Tom recovered?
You can't be liked by everyone
Should I speak English?
Is she divorced or married?
I'm relaxing at home today
He didn't come for some reason
Something's up with you
I really don't like liars
What an angry man!
You've got a sense of humor
Is this red wine?
Who is he?
Do I know him?
Do you sell red wine?
Did he warn you?
We're used to the cold
Sorry, I couldn’t hear you
Do you live in a big city?
This isn't the best time
My school has 1,000 students
Who's this from?
I’m going to wash my face
Help!
Coronavirus doesn’t exist
Real people have this disease!
Hey, Karen, what’s wrong?
Was the manager sick today?
For any other color, type 'B.'
What is love about?
Tom set Mary's lyrics to music
We didn't win that game
That's what it'll take to win
Who's your dentist?
Doctor Dupont.
Fast-forward it
What was their name?
Hans, my brother, is German
You didn't tell me the truth
Don't worry
You nailed it.
I can't trust you, either
He's a nurse, not a doctor
We were young once too.
I'd like to be your guide
Don't break down now
It's my favorite dessert
That's how French is
I just got promoted!
Is it doable?
Is it feasible?
Is he a student?
I'm going to let you finish
Yanni is Skura's son
Yanni knows what he's doing
Yanni doesn't mind
Yanni can't divorce Skura
He can't divorce Skura
Yanni can't hear
How could Yanni get supplies?
He doesn't have any money
When did Yanni paint this?
I really don't feel like it
Let's close the subject
I've never missed you
Look at Yanni's hair
Yanni can't paint
Yanni can't draw
Yanni can't dance
Would you say that again?
You're a psycho.
It's just a symbol
Why did you pain this picture?
Yanni can't believe Skura
What did God say?
Yanni can't go to the concert
This is Yanni's lucky day
Yanni doesn't know anything
Why is Yanni talking this way?
Was that a coincidence, too?
Was that an accident, too?
Did Yanni see the accident?
That's Yanni's office
Skura's ex-husband came back
Don't discuss that
It's superstition.
Yanni isn't hurt
Yanni didn't even enter
Yanni isn't even close
No buts!
I'll be right back
He didn't even shake his hand
We are in a race," Ravel said
I'm tired of all the lies
Which bed do you sleep in?
You really think I can fly?
It’s time to eat something!
Please, help her!
I really do love to travel!
Yes, I live here
I'll eat when I get home
I'd like to make a complaint
It's deep here
Is the store open?
Did you return the books?
It's unbearably hot today
They don't smoke
Who does he think he is?
I don't like crutches
I’m already seeing it
Who tore my shirt?
You're late again, Tom.
I slept in.
It's fine
Mary, I need your help.
You can't do anything yourself
Please!
You're being too impatient
They're in the restaurant
Thanks for that useful tip!
Is the Pantheon in Rome domed?
He admired Tom's courage
It's slowly taking shape.
Who's that man there?
Who?
What tie are you putting on?
The one I bought yesterday.
Why didn't he say hello?
How should I know?
I hope it'll work next time
The cold weather's here
What's it like to be seasick?
What's it like being seasick?
How did you work that out?
I don't even know anymore
That'll do for the time being
She's a genius
We won't change our minds
We can't live on our own
How would you change things?
We don't always get our way
We haven't changed our minds
Tom and I didn't eat together
I don’t know, you tell me!
Now how can we trust you?
Yes, why not?
Do you hear that too?
Are you Turks?
How's your mom?
I like playing cards.
Me too.
You'll get his letter soon
I'll have time this Sunday
That isn't the right answer
We're very proud of our kids
Tom didn't sit down
Tom didn't go to prison
Tom wasn't imprisoned
Is this German?
No, silly
It's Berber.
Why is Yanni laughing?
This is Yanni's restaurant
Algeria..
Yanni's boss laid him off
Yanni can't work
Yanni won't tell Skura
Yanni doesn't listen to Skura
Yanni isn't sick
Yanni forgot Skura's birthday
Yanni was wearing a skirt.
It's a kilt.
Is Yanni Scottish?
No, why?
He's wearing a kilt.
Is Yanni Scottish?
No.
Why is he wearing a kilt then?
You mean the whole building.
Yes.
He must be crazy.
Hi, Yanni.
I was just thinking about you.
Talking is Yanni's specialty
Yanni has a brand-new wardrobe
Yanni's dashboard is dusty
Yanni, where have you been?
Yanni didn't trust Skura
Yanni didn't win
Yanni doesn't deserve it
Tom didn't have that option
Yanni didn't get anything
Is this all Yanni gets?
Yanni fixed Skura's dishwasher
Obviously.
I know why she wasn't at work
Do you like translating?
That's not the way it was
That isn't really true
Is today Wednesday?
Look at the calendar.
Yanni dented Skura's car
I'll deal with him later.
It's really straightforward
Tom didn't take off his socks
We've already told our parents
Hi, I'm Skura's boyfriend
And you are?
I'm about to faint.
I'd like to see the room
Tom wasn't much help
Tom's a bit of a troll
Only birds have feathers.
“What about angels?
I thought they had them too.
We didn't do our homework
I’m so bored!
My dream was so cool!
I want to see what'll happen
How on earth did you get in?
Tom didn't come to the game
That isn't a reason to panic
Let's hire a maid
Why is shoplifting bad?
That isn't always the case
We're waiting for our mother
That's not all Tom wanted
We don't regret our decision
We've enjoyed our stay here
He wasn't much help
She wasn't much help
I'm a yo-yo dieter
That isn't a good choice
I didn't hear anything at all
I'm very thirsty
That isn't a hard question
We're selling our car
Was she French?
That isn't so bad
Nobody's living in the flat
That isn't an answer
I hardly know where to begin.
Start at the beginning.
That isn't how the world works
That isn't a road
It's just a path
Mary won't interfere
She didn't hear the alarm
I'll make you understand
There aren't many options
Look!
A bunny!
I didn't have the desire
He didn't have the desire
She didn't have the desire
As you decide, I'll do it
I'm gonna get some coffee
Well, I just don't know!
Everyone, get up!
There's much to do today!
Tom saw blood on Mary's shoes
He's come down in the world
We're on our way there now
It's a set expression
Thanks for repairing it.
There was nothing to it.
The heating's off
Is that on purpose?
Is that intentional?
Is that on purpose?
She doesn't mean that
She doesn't mean it like that
He doesn't mean that
He doesn't mean it like that
Tom didn't see who hit Mary
There's no interest in them.
No one's interested in them.
What's written on the placard?
What's on that placard?
Is that all?
No, wait
There's something else.
He can't stay for too long
There'll be another chance
That isn't for me to say
He's cleaning the stable
How badly did Tom get hurt?
That works too, of course
Does that lady know you?
The weather's good today
How did you sleep last night?
Not very well.
He's a doctor now
Is your room big?
What have they missed?
What've they missed?
She thinks it's already over
They think it's all over
They've lost their way
They've got lost
Are you getting your hair cut?
Are you having your hair cut?
The village baker's has closed
I don't feel safe anywhere
We're losing our patience
Tom listened to Mary's podcast
We need more synergy.
What does that mean?
We're all hustlers
Tom's fever subsided
Tom's fever has subsided
Please don't disturb
That isn't really my job
Tom can't even keep a secret
Tom did a good job, too
I didn't feel nervous at all
Where is Tom?
I'd like to talk to him
Tom didn't want to hire Mary
I'm going to spank you
Tom hasn't seen Mary for years
That isn't a nice thing to say
Tom didn't write me back
That isn't a good sign
Tom didn't take his socks off
Tom saw Mary's car pull up
We're up to our ears in debt
Ooh, shiny
Pull over now!
I'm gonna do it
Do you want some tacos?
Don't do that.
Why shouldn't I?
I did it!
I made it!
I was about to go, too
If it hurts, squeeze my hand
What am I, a waiter?
How old do you think I look?
I'm from Australia
Where are you from?
I can't hold it!
We're almost there
Yeah, I know it's a lot
Tom didn't ask me
Five, plus five, potato!
Time to count!
You're the only one who knows
Let's rest here for a while
Last month was October, right?
I hadn't any chance
When was it ever popular?
I don't need it
I don't need it
That isn't accurate, is it?
We'll all be asleep soon
Soon, we'll all be asleep
How did you open the door?
Tom didn't get any gifts
I couldn't see who it was
How did you hurt yourself?
I wonder what'll become of Tom
Which direction is north?
I think he can't help you
You don't need to call him
You don't need to call her
She can't do it
Your age?" "16.
Yanni isn't hungry
Not it's full
It's not full
Yanni's skin feels so smooth
Yanni didn't go to the movies
Yanni didn't get a job
Yanni can't find a job
That's sweet of you, Yanni
What happened to Yanni?
Was Yanni driving?
That isn't legal
What happened to you, Yanni?
Have a seat, Yanni
Have my seat, Yanni
Did Yanni get Skura a job?
Where are your manners, Yanni?
That's my girl.
Yanni didn't sit down
See you tomorrow, Yanni
It didn't go OK
Yanni can't find Skura a job
It's all Yanni's fault
It's not Yanni's fault
Yanni doesn't understand
How long was he there?
How long was she there?
Let's go inside
It's cold out here
Cheer up, Yanni
It's not the end of the world
That counts, too
Yanni isn't surprised
That's not an illness
Yanni sabotaged Skura's car
Yanni can't sleep
Yanni didn't sleep last night
Do you remember Yanni?
I'm not gonna bite you, come!
I love you, Skura
Watch my lips: I love you
Yanni won't give up
Yanni isn't perfect
Yanni shouldn't give up
Tom didn't bother responding
How do you like the soup?
I've never seen that movie
What's that?
It's Yanni
He's snoring.
Yanni can't handle this
Don't worry about Yanni
Yanni's room is available
This is Yanni's weekend off
Yanni's hands smell funny
Yanni's room smells funny
Do me a favor, Yanni
Don't talk about that again
What has Yanni done?
That's exactly what Yanni said
Where are you going?
Algeria.
Yanni says he's starving
I'm starving.
It's coming.
What's this?
It's eggs.
Yanni doesn't like eggs
What's different around here?
How is Algeria?
My birthday is on April 4th.
Yanni.
What now?
Yanni can't go out
Yanni can't just quit
Yanni can't just leave
Yanni shouldn't stop now
Yanni shouldn't give up now
Yanni can't just give up
Alright, you can have my bed
Where's Yanni?
That's Yanni
Yanni has Churchill's pen
Did Yanni snore last night?
Yanni is family, you know
Yanni doesn't have much time
What really causes snoring?
Yanni read Skura's column
So long, Skura
Sorry, Yanni
Yanni likes it here, too
Yanni snores, too
What's this music?
It's techno.
Yanni didn't it perfectly
This is so unfair, Yanni
Yanni's job is boring
Yanni loves Skura's muffins
Don't forget my diet Cola
Knock, knock.
Who're there?
Yanni.
Yanni who?
Yanni can't fire Skura
This isn't fair, Yanni.
Life is unfair.
Yanni isn't going anywhere
Yanni ruined Skura's career
Yanni did that, too
Yanni sold that stuff, too
Let's build a snowman later
I'm sorry.
I bet you are sorry.
Stop interrupting me, Yanni
Don't interrupt, Yanni
Don't interrupt, Yanni
When Yanni cries, Skura cries
Breathe deeply, Yanni
Yanni doesn't like it
What's Yanni doing?
Yanni is a good-looking man
Yanni can't stop working
Yanni and Skura won't quit
How tall is Yanni?
Mom.
What?
I love you.
I love you, too, Yanni.
You're my sunshine, Yanni
Yanni saw Skura's face
Yanni isn't all that bright
Yanni won't change his mind
Tom said he didn't see anybody
What's Yanni doing here?
Yanni doesn't want to see that
Please don't give me that look
Yanni, please stop
Yanni can't eat
Yanni isn't home yet
I love you.
I love you, too, Skura.
Call me.
Yanni's mom is gonna kill him
Stop, Yanni
Yanni didn't work
Yanni doesn't work
Yanni doesn't want that
Yanni didn't go to school
Yanni doesn't see it
Is Skura pregnant?
Skura was Yanni's first love
What does Yanni mean?
Why doesn't Yanni like Skura?
Yanni doesn't like Skura
Where are you going, Yanni?
Let him go, Yanni
Let her go, Yanni
Yanni's glasses are broken
Go home, Yanni
Why is Yanni here?
Yanni's door is locked
Yanni's feet are hurting
Why is Yanni in my house?
Yanni didn't open that door
Yanni didn't open that window
That's the problem with Yanni
Yanni is hungry, too
Yanni loves you, too
Yanni loves Skura, too
Yanni stole Skura's key
Yanni shouldn't do that
Who's Yanni?
Yanni is Skura's boyfriend
Give me my money back, Yanni
It's a scam, Yanni
Give me my money, Yanni
Here's a dollar
Yanni is Skura's brother
Don't break it, Yanni
It's purely platonic
It's a platonic love
I've been missing you
It's friendship
Yanni says it's just platonic
What does platonic love mean?
It's easy to confuse the two
Yanni shouldn't freak out
Don't freak out
It's just a tiny spider
Yanni is a co-worker
Yanni doesn't have that
Yanni doesn't do that
Yanni knows that he's safe
Do you love Skura?
It's just platonic.
Yanni won't care
Yanni won't care either
Where does Yanni come from?
Yanni doesn't worry about that
Yanni doesn't accept criticism
We've already paid our rent
Well, that was weird
I've already heard about that
That isn't a bug
Where can I pick up the cards?
I've done that multiple times
You're teaching
Today's Monday
We've got our pride
I'm glad they changed it.
You'll never run out of ideas
Tom didn't take off his watch
Is she home?
Tom hasn't seen this video yet
This piece doesn't fit
Tom didn't get there on time
That isn't your book
We're all charlatans
We're all swindlers
They finally took a hike!
He's a very hard worker
I have to see Tom.
What for?
Tom didn't see Mary on the bus
He isn't at his father's level
Jump across!
Marina is a woman's name
I found this in Tom's closet
Everything's good at home

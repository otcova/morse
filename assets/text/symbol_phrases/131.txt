I don't want you to enjoy it
I don't want you to get hurt
I don't want you to kill Tom
I don't want you to see this
I don't want you to tell Tom
I figured you'd want to know
I knew you'd want to be told
I really didn't want to play
I want to be there, you know
I want to know if it's close
I wouldn't want to miss this
I wouldn't want to speculate
I'd like to hear your advice
I'd like to keep it that way
I'd like to make a statement
I'd like to offer a proposal
I'd like to solve the puzzle
I'd like to start seeing you
I'd like Tom to take me home
I'd like you to accompany me
I'd like you to come with me
I'd like you to look into it
I'd like you to make one now
I'd like your candid opinion
If you want me to go, I will
If you want to come, you can
If you want to know, just ask
It's not how I want us to be
Tell Tom we don't want to go
Tom and Mary don't want that

Why do you want to work here?
Why does Tom want to hurt me?
Why doesn't Tom want us over?
Why would I want to go there?
Why would Tom want Mary dead?
Why would Tom want to see us?
Why would we want to do that?
You don't want me to do that
You don't want to go, do you?
You wouldn't want to be late
You wouldn't want to do that
Actually, they want to pay us
Are you sure you want to know?
Are you sure you want to quit?
Didn't Tom want to talk to us?
Do you really want to be here?
Do you really want to do this?
Do you want a turkey sandwich?
Do you want me to check again?
Do you want me to handle this?
Do you want me to help you up?

I don't want to humiliate Tom
I don't want to interrupt Tom
I don't want to kill you, Tom

I'd like to talk to Tom again
I'd like to think that's true
I'd like you back on the team
I'd like you to accompany Tom
I'd like you to meet with Tom
I'd like your opinion on this
I'm not sure I want to see it
I'm sure you don't want to go
I've always wanted to do this
If you don't want to go, fine
If you want me to go, I'll go
Is that what you want to hear?
It's not like I want you here
Listen, I don't want to fight
They don't want to talk to me
They don't want you to use it
They'll want to remember this
Tom didn't want to talk to me
Tom doesn't want to be a hero
Tom doesn't want to be caught
Tom doesn't want to hear this
Tom doesn't want to negotiate
Tom doesn't want to work here
Tom obviously doesn't want it
You don't want that
We don't want to ignore facts
We don't want to pressure you
We only want to help you, Tom
What do you want me to do now?
What do you want the list for?
What don't you want us to see?
What else do you want from me?
What else do you want to know?

Why did you want Tom to leave?
Why would Tom want to do that?
Why would you even want to go?
Why would you want me to stay?
Why would you want to help me?
Would you like to come inside?
You really don't want to know
You want a divorce, don't you?
Hey Tom, I want to talk to you
I assumed you'd want me to pay
I didn't want to embarrass you
I didn't want to humiliate Tom
I didn't want to miss anything
I didn't want to tell you this
I didn't want to use the phone
I didn't want Tom to bother me
I didn't want you to read that
I don't know what I want to do
I don't want anyone to hear me
I don't want anything from you
I don't want people to hate me
I don't want this night to end
I don't want to antagonize Tom
I don't want to argue with you
I don't want to be alone again
I don't want to be here either

I don't want to talk about Tom
I don't want to turn myself in
I don't want Tom getting upset
I don't want Tom to go to jail
I don't want you to be nervous
I don't want your legal advice
I just don't want any of these
I just don't want to marry Tom
I just don't want to marry you
I never said I didn't want you
I really don't want to do that
I want to know what's going on
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
I wouldn't want to show you up
I'd like to ask you a question
I'd like to buy a refrigerator
I'd like to hear that from Tom
I'd like to request a transfer
I'd like to take a look around
I'd like you to leave my house
I'm exactly where I want to be
I'm not so sure I want the job
I'm not sure I want to do that
Look, I don't want any trouble
People don't want to hear that
That's not the way I wanted it
Tom didn't want me to kiss him
Tom didn't want you to do that
Tom doesn't want Mary to leave
Tom doesn't want to compromise
Tom doesn't want to discuss it
Tom doesn't want to leave Mary
Tom doesn't want to see anyone
Tom just didn't want to see me
Tom says he doesn't want to go
We don't want to cause a panic
We want to know who's the best
You said you didn't want to go
You'll want to write this down
Do you have one?
Crap, I think he saw us
I didn't mean it like that
Tom wants a hug, too
Linguists' help needed
You'll give me a heart attack
Spread the news!
That's no way to behave
He's Hungarian
Like I care!
Shall we pull a gag?
Tom's a dope
Go fix the hot-water bottle
She's a drama queen
Where are you?
I'm here!
Where are you in the world?
There's a widespread delirium
Let's play a trivia game
She's playing Super Mario Bros
That's how the pros do it
It's not impossible
It's not legally binding
I can't see through walls
He's incredibly stupid
She's unbelievably stupid
You're a fucking idiot!
She's not stupid
She's a dumb blonde
You can't stop progress
Can I try it?
I'm not worried about him
I'm not worried about her
I'm not worried about them
I'm worried about her
I'm worried about them
He's allergic to cats
She's allergic to cats
I don't work here
This doesn't mean anything
Is it safe?
It doesn't hurt at all
You don't look your age
He's a successful banker
She's young and sexy
He's sexy and muscular
She caught me off-guard
He caught me off-guard
You caught me off-guard
It's not out yet
Am I disturbing something?
Am I disturbing anything?
That's very thoughtful
It's rather ironic
It's just a formality
You're not welcome here
Are you still interested?
Is he still interested?
Is she still interested?
I don't think it's true
Don't tease me
It's because she loves me
It's because he loves me
It's because I love you
It's because I love him
It's because I love her
I'm sorry about yesterday
Is this fake?
He's love struck
What is "man"?
I'm sorely puzzled
I'll steal your mobile phone!
Is this list reliable?
It's Tatoeba
Oh wait, no
I'll assemble a file for you
Tom doesn't eat much
Tom doesn't eat much meat
She's fucked up
I'm fucked up
Tom doesn't eat any meat
Tom doesn't eat any dark meat
Tom doesn't eat dark meat
Don't doubt his words
You are playing hard-to-get
Are you lying to me?
What is the purpose of life?
It's an American company
It's a Chinese company
What is the meaning of life?
It's not illegal
Do you have his number?
What is the price of peace?
I don't want someone else
Let's hurry
We don't want to be late
I'm going for a run
Do you want to come?
How shall we find it?
She prefers white-sand beaches
First, you must last
Have you been poor?
Breathe, damn you!
You've got some brass
Boring is good: events are bad
Shoemaker, stick to your last
He's a caution when liquored
It's a masterpiece
Of course that's nonsense
Hens don't fly over walls
It's very direct
I don't want another job
He didn't look happy
He doesn't look happy
It's delicious
She's nice to me
She's being nice to me
Oh boy, there I go again
He is my great-grandfather
What's your status?
I would never betray you!
The cat caught me by surprise!
Hand out your money!
Don't blow your nose like that
We haven't got much time
It's going to be all right
I don't think she's faking
I don't think he's faking
I think he's faking
I think she's faking
I'm meeting Tom for dinner
Do want to come?
How did last night go?
I can't promise anything
How did it go last night?
You've done your homework
He's done his homework
She's done her homework
I think we're too young
I think he's too young
I think she's too young
He's lazy
She's lazy
She's still alive
He's still alive
I'm addicted
He's addicted
She's addicted
You've got to be kidding me!
It's a must-see
It's the correct answer
You have got to be joking!
He isn't afraid to die
I can't explain it to you now
There's no wind here
Here there's no wind
I don't want Tom to drive
He's been drinking
Do you want some water?
Yeah, I'd love some.
We all do.
Don't look back
What time is your flight home?
I'm not fooling anybody
Where did that idea come from?
Have you got plans?
What's the plan, then?
It's happening tonight
Do you have plans tonight?
We deep-fried the turkey
I want Tom's money
I don't want to quit
Do you want to resign?
Does Tom want to rest?
I don't want to leave
I'd like to thank you
Did you want to see me?
Do you want to meet Tom?
I don't want to be rude
I don't want to kill you
I don't want to meet Tom
I don't want to pass out
I don't want to remember
I don't want Tom to hear
I think I'd want to know
I want your opinion, too
We don't want you to die
Do you want to leave here?
I didn't want to lose Tom
I didn't want to tell you
I don't want to lose face
I don't want to scare you
I'd like you to handle it
We don't want to hurt you
You don't want to be late
Do you want to get married?
Do you want to see my baby?
Do you want to take a look?
Don't you want to meet Tom?
I didn't want to scare you
I don't want to lie to Tom
I don't want to name names
I don't want to seem pushy
I don't want Tom in my car
I don't want you to scream
I want what's best for you
It's Tom I want to talk to
Tom, come here, I want you
Tom, I want to talk to Mary
Tom, I want to talk to you
Why do you want to kill me?
Why would you want to lose?
Do you want to ride with us?
I didn't want to insult Tom
I didn't want to seem pushy
I don't really want to stop
I don't want to lose my job
I don't want to trouble you
I don't want you doing that
I really don't want to play
I want to know what's funny
I want to know why I'm here
What would Tom want with me?
Why did Tom want two copies?
Why do you want to hurt Tom?
Do you want to know my guess?
Do you want to know who I am?
I don't even want to be here
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to start rumors
I don't want to work for you
I just want to say I'm sorry
Tom didn't want to hurt Mary
Tom, I want to stay with you
What did you want to show me?
When do you want to meet Tom?
Why did Tom want Mary killed?
Why does Tom want to find us?
I don't want to lie to you
Do you want to leave with Tom?
I don't want to hurt you, Tom
I don't want to know his name
I don't want to play with Tom
I don't want to see Tom naked
I don't want Tom in this room
I'd like to make a suggestion
That isn't what I want to see
That's a debt I want to repay
We wouldn't want to risk that
Why does Tom want to kill you?
Why doesn't Tom want you here?
Why would Tom want to help us?
You said you didn't want that
I don't want to insult Tom
I don't really want to be here
I don't want to come to Boston
I don't want you to harass Tom
I just didn't want you in here
I want to know what's so funny
I wouldn't want to lose my job
We don't want to be late again
Please go with Tom.
What if we don't want to?
You're the one who didn't
May I speak with Tom?
I've got to show you something
Have we understood each other?
Do you want some?
Who are the judges?
You can't run from the past
It's sunny today
I'll study a lot
I'm going to travel tomorrow
I need help right now!
How can I show you my love?
I urgently need your help!
The phone is ringing!
I'm watching TV
This is Mr. Pedro
I'm Brazilian
Let's save the environment!
I'm done caring
The next time will be better!
Where's this club?
Is this news true?
Good news!
I wonder if I've caught a cold
I wonder if I've caught a cold
Can I take photographs here?
Only outside.
I'm going to the movies
We're really in a recession
We are poor, but we are happy
Where was it?
I've forgotten it
Children shouldn't be spoiled
Do you hit your children?
When do owls sleep?
I'll come with you
She's always happy and smiling
I don't have all day
Have you told me everything?
Are you ill?
You're very sweet
He's very sweet
She's very sweet
I'm going to have a shower
Make love, not sentences
Where can one buy books?
Didn't anyone follow you?
You remember it?
He came, he saw, and he lost
What do you think about Tom?
Why are you under the table?
On Tuesday, it was really cold
That's really annoying
She's dating my brother
He's dating my sister
My wife is pregnant!
You can't take those!
You'll tell me what about it?
She's a terrible do-nothing
Is he really coming?
Is your brother's name Alexei?
He's absent-minded
She's stark naked
She's as naked as a jaybird
She's a ghost writer
Do you get me?
Understand?
Dig?
Are you hip?
Let me know!
Don't you want to know why?
They don't sell beer here
There's no beer sold here
In winter, night falls quickly
Give me a cup of milk, please
What a pleasant surprise!
Lo, the promised snow!
Y'all come!
You all come see us, now!
Heaven forfend!
Heaven forbid!
What the hell was that?!
The movie wasn't half bad
Can we talk later?
He entered the lion's den
He walked into the lion's den
He stepped into the lion's den
Now it's about what we do next
Can you wait a bit?
Dammit!
That was our only way out!
Hold it!
The gum's ten cents
Something's out of whack here
Good God!
Oh, it's you
I'm sort of an introvert
I'm sort of an extrovert
The less said, the better
We're in 3/4 time here
He doesn't have a hat on
Where is the giraffe?
I want to do both.
I hear you're selling your car
What do you want for it?
However, she backed away
How much do you want for it?
I don't want a lot of money
Do you want a second opinion?
Why would Tom want that?
If you want to talk, talk
Do you want to say goodbye?
I'm tired of being retired
He's a quick study
Open, Sesame!
I didn't know this song
We're happy
Is Tom happy?
They're happy
Was Tom happy?
I'm happy here
I'm happy, Tom
I'm happy, too
Nobody's happy
Were you happy?
You'll be happy
Are we all happy?
I'm always happy
I'm fairly happy
I'm really happy
Tom wasn't happy
We weren't happy
Happy anniversary!
I'm happy for Tom
I'm happy for you
I'm happy to help
I'm happy to talk
I'm happy to wait
I'm happy tonight
I'm just so happy
It's a happy tune
They're not happy
Are you happy, Tom?
Did Tom seem happy?
Happy Thanksgiving!
I'm happy for them
I'm happy to do it
I'm not happy here
Is everybody happy?
We're really happy
Are you still happy?
I'm perfectly happy
Why is Tom so happy?
You're always happy
Are we all happy now?
Are you really happy?
I'd be happy to help
I'm happy to hear it
I'm happy where I am
I'm happy you called
I've been happy here
I've been very happy
That's a happy sound
That's why I'm happy
Why would I be happy?
You don't seem happy
I couldn't be happier
I was happy, wasn't I?
I'm glad you're happy
I'm happy to be alive
I'm happy to meet you
I'm so happy you came
That'll make me happy
They don't seem happy
Tom doesn't look happy
Tom still isn't happy
We'd be happy to help
Who made you so happy?
You'll be happy again
Are you happy now, Tom?
Do you think I'm happy?
I can't make Tom happy
I know why Tom's happy
I'll be happy to do it
I'm a pretty happy guy
I'm happy to cooperate
I'm happy you're happy
I'm just happy for Tom
I'm so happy right now
I'm very happy for you
That's a happy thought
Tom isn't much happier
Tom, I'm happy for you
We couldn't be happier
We're so happy for you
Who's the happy couple?
At least I'll die happy
Do I usually seem happy?
Does Tom make you happy?
I'd be happy to come in
I'll be happy to comply
I'm happy to have a job
I'm not happy with this
I'm so happy to be home
I'm so happy to see you
I'm so happy you called
I've never been happier
Is Tom happy about this?
They weren't happy here
Tom makes me happy, too
Tom says he's not happy
Was I really that happy?
You don't look so happy
You've never been happy
Are you happy about this?
Aren't we happy together?
Did Tom look happy to go?
Does that make you happy?
I hope you're happy, too
I'd be happy to tell Tom
I'll be happy to explain
I'm happy for all of you
I'm happy to be with Tom
I'm not happy about this
I'm not happy to be here
I'm only happy on payday
I'm perfectly happy here
I'm really happy for Tom
I'm so happy for you two
I'm so happy to meet you
I'm so happy you're back
I'm so happy you're here
Tom is not happy, either
Was Tom happy doing that?
We've never been happier
What a happy coincidence!
Why are you all so happy?
You don't look too happy
You won't be happy there
I promise you'll be happy
I was happy to do it, Tom
I'd be happy to cooperate
I'll never be happy again
I'm a pretty happy person
I'm glad I make you happy
I'm happy doing what I do
I'm happy to be here, Tom
I'm just happy to see you
I'm so happy for you both
I'm so happy for you guys
I'm so happy for you, Tom
I'm so happy you found me
I'm so happy you found us
I'm so happy you like Tom
I'm sure happy to see you
If you're not happy, quit
It doesn't make Tom happy
Let them know we're happy
That's what made me happy
We're very happy together
What makes you happy, Tom?
Would that make you happy?
You don't look very happy
You sound very happy, Tom
You're not happy, are you?
Aren't you happy to see me?
I'm certainly happy to try
I'm glad you're happy, Tom
I'm happy to ride with Tom
I'm happy you're here, Tom
I'm only too happy to help
If you're happy, I'm glad
Tom didn't look that happy
Tom doesn't look too happy
Tom doesn't seem too happy
Tom isn't happy about this
We'd be happy to cooperate
We're so happy you're here
What're you so happy about?
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Doesn't that make you happy?
I'd be happy to go with you
I'm genuinely happy for Tom
I'm going to make you happy
I'm happy it all worked out
I'm happy that you're happy
I'm so happy you stopped by
I've never seen Tom happier
That wouldn't make me happy
That'll make Tom very happy
Tom doesn't look very happy
Tom wasn't happy to see Mary
We're one big, happy family
When Tom's happy, I'm happy
Why are you always so happy?
You're supposed to be happy
A lot of people aren't happy
Don't look so happy about it
Hardly anybody's happy today
I hope you're happy together
I know Tom's not happy there
I'm happy to do this for you
I'm just so happy to see you
I'm only happy when it rains
I've never seen Tom so happy
I've never seen you so happy
They aren't happy to see Tom
Tom doesn't seem much happier
Tom isn't too happy about it
Why do you all look so happy?
Do you know what happiness is?
I couldn't be happier for you
I'd be happy to give it a try
I'd be happy to work with you
I'm happy just to be near you
I'm really happy for you guys
I'm really happy for you, Tom
I'm so happy that you're here
I'm so happy to see you again
I've never seen them so happy
It's nice to see Tom so happy
That's a happy-looking family
We'll be happy to do our part
You don't look all that happy
You're happy here, aren't you?
I don't deserve to be so happy
I hate it when you're so happy
I'd be happy to have you along
I'm a sucker for happy endings
I'm glad it makes you so happy
I'm going to make myself happy
I'm happy to hear you say that
I'm not exactly happy about it
I'm not going to be very happy
I'm so happy you could make it
If you'd kiss me, I'd be happy
It's great to see you so happy
They'll be very happy together
They're a happy-looking couple
Tom and Mary aren't happy here
Tom hasn't been happy recently
Tom isn't looking much happier
Tom wasn't happy about leaving
We've been very happy together
You're always complaining
In my city, Warsaw, it is cold
It's not worth the effort
Is this a dream?
It isn't a dream
It's a dream job
It's all a dream
You're a dreamer
It wasn't a dream
It's a pipe dream
You're the dreamer
It's just a bad dream
It's like a bad dream
Did you really dream about me?
It's a dream come true
I know I'm not dreaming
I feel like I'm dreaming
I don't remember my dreams
Tom's dream is coming true
I wouldn't dream of doing that
What a beautiful baby!
What a beautiful ring!
What a beautiful house!
What a beautiful place!
What a beautiful sight!
What a beautiful story!
What a beautiful campus!
What a beautiful morning!
Is Tom handsome?
Isn't Tom handsome?
It's beautiful here
That's so beautiful
That's a beautiful name
That's a beautiful ring
That's a beautiful suit
That's really beautiful
You're really beautiful
You're a beautiful woman
Isn't it a beautiful day?
It's a beautiful picture
It's beautiful, isn't it?
That's a beautiful photo
That's a beautiful story
It's absolutely beautiful
It's incredibly beautiful
It's such a beautiful day
You're a very handsome man
You're as handsome as ever
Beautiful evening, isn't it?
That's a beautiful bracelet
That's a beautiful necklace
That's a beautiful painting
You look very handsome, Tom
You're still very beautiful
Mary is beautiful, isn't she?
It's such a beautiful morning
You're such a beautiful woman
You're a beautiful young woman

How busy could Tom be?
I'm a little busy now

I've been rather busy
It's been busy lately
Look, I'm really busy
Tom isn't at all busy
Tom isn't busy at all
I see you've been busy

I'm a little busy, Tom
I'm a very busy person
I'm too busy next week

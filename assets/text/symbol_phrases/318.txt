She's an avid feminist
You destroyed his self-love
He's got a fixation
You can't just do it!
You think it's easy!
It's easier said than done!
How many years has it been?
How do you find me attractive?
Apparently, I can't resist you
They're cool people
And red, driving him out
They're a perfect match
I'll try to do as you suggest
I have no life, but hard labor
He's a pedant
He's a hairsplitter
I'm a tractor driver
Her works don't age
She's got a nice ass

I don't know when Tom died
Tom must've gone crazy
We've achieved our objectives
Why did you lie to the police?
Would it be OK if I used this?
You're very likely to succeed
I wasn't willing to compromise
I wasn't woken up by the noise
I'm sure Tom can handle it
I'll explain the problem later
If Tom wants to go, he can
It's a good thing you did that
It's a very competitive market
Is Tom doing that right now?
It's a very special day for me
Participation isn't compulsory
Preregistration isn't required
There aren't any other options
Unfortunately, mistakes happen
Tom is a real go-getter
Obviously, Tom is talented
Of course, Tom can do that
That's why Tom is the best
At least, Tom doesn't snore
Hopefully, Tom is all right
I can't tell you who Tom is
Let's go to a movie tomorrow
Could I speak to Mr. Jackson?
Could I speak to Tom Jackson?
Let's go see a movie tomorrow
You're my hero, Sami
I've got to go, Sami
That's not what Sami thinks
I'm not good at maths
Are you Sami's daughter?
Sami had Layla's phone
This phone is Sami's
Where is Sami's dad?
When is Sami's birthday?
None of Sami's numbers works
Sami's face was covered
Sami wasn't telling the truth
Prove it!
Hold on!
Let's see!
Hahaha!
You're my idol, Sami
You're my champion, Sami
You're my star, Sami
Tom's face haunts me
That's a fib
Show Tom who's boss
Shut your mouth, Tom
Shall we do that?
Singing is Tom's thing
Shall I have Tom do that?
That's exorbitant
That's how Tom does that
Tears ran down Tom's face
That's how Tom spoke to us
Shall we do that now?
Tom looks like he's motivated
That isn't the issue
Tom looks like he's uncertain
That's about average
That's beyond stupid
That's called piracy
That's fairly simple
That's never changed
Tom paid for Mary's schooling
How stupid can you be?
That's how I did that
Shall we do that first?
Should we speak French?
That goes for you, too
That wasn't negotiable
That'll continue today
That's a hard decision
That's already illegal
That's an outright lie
Payment isn't necessary
Tom should've been displeased
Tom should've been supportive
Shall we go and do that?
Shall we try to do that?
Someone's spying on you
That's a big difference
That's another question
That's called hypocrisy
That's happening Monday
That's never acceptable
That's always been there
Tom wasn't at the crime scene
That's an abuse of power
Tom wasn't breaking the rules
That's highly subjective
Tom wasn't quite finished yet
Please don't sing anymore
Profits aren't guaranteed
Shall we do that together?
Shall we do that tomorrow?
Technically, I'm homeless
That wouldn't convince me
That's another difference
Tom won't let us speak French
That's interesting indeed
Tom won't likely be concerned
That's just irresponsible
Tom won't likely be dangerous
Tom won't likely be depressed
Tom won't likely be irritated
Should voting be mandatory?
Tom won't likely be sarcastic
Tom wouldn't have let you win
Tom wouldn't run away from me
That's absolutely horrible
Tom's application was refused
That's breaking new ground
Tom's dream finally came true
That's extraordinarily low
Tom's hard work is paying off
Tom's health has deteriorated
Should I buy it now or wait?
Tom's perspective has changed
So, what does that tell you?
That's a legitimate concern
That's a weight off my mind
That's completely ludicrous
So, what do they normally do?
So, what do you think so far?
So, where do we go from here?
Tom and Mary had a falling-out
That's extremely frustrating
Please don't hate us for this
Please don't make us eat that
Tom applied for asylum in 2013
Shouldn't that be your choice?
So, what was your point again?
Sorry, I don't get your point
That's absolutely unbelievable
Tom didn't die a natural death
Tom didn't do a stitch of work
Tom didn't even bring a camera
Tom didn't let me speak French
Tom didn't make it easy for me
Tom didn't make the first move
Tom didn't mention you by name
Tom didn't say who fired first
Tom didn't seem ruffled at all
Tom didn't want to be embalmed
Tom doesn't care why Mary lied
Tom doesn't look entirely well
Tom doesn't seem to be curious
Tom doesn't seem to be relaxed
Tom doesn't seem to be shocked
Tom doesn't seem to be wealthy
What would you have done?
Tom hasn't asked us for it yet
Tom hasn't been heard of since
I can't change
I didn't expect Tom to sing
I didn't pay Tom to do that
I don't know where Tom died
It's not clear why Tom left
Of course, Tom had a choice
Shouldn't Tom be here today?
Surely Tom wouldn't do that
That's what Tom loves to do
Why didn't Tom come tonight?
Tom should've left early
Don't ask me how Tom does it
Evidently, Tom can't do that
Tom shouldn't be outside
Hopefully, Tom won't do that
Should I have Tom do that?
I'm more worried than Tom is
In 2013, Tom moved to Boston
It's nice that Tom does that
Perhaps Tom should've stayed
That wasn't all that Tom did
That's the way Tom wanted it
That's what Tom needed to do
That's where Tom needs to be
That's where Tom wants to go
That's why Tom carries a gun
That's why Tom is doing that
Tom said Mary won't do that
I didn't think Tom would win
I knew that Tom wouldn't wait
Tom knew I'd be on time
Tom hopes you'll be there
Tom is a do-it-yourselfer
Don't believe a word Tom says
Hopefully, Tom won't run away
He’ll contrive an explanation
Don’t just go off half-cocked
I’ll go in on it with you
I'm not going to let Tom sing
I'm sure Tom isn't a Canadian
What's all this to-do about?
Can't sleep, Tom?
I'm looking for my cell phone
I'm not risking anything
She's unbearable
Where's the shoe department?
That's something I'll cherish
That's not why Tom lied
That isn't why Tom lied
That's not Tom style
That isn't Tom style
That's not sustainable
That isn't sustainable
That's not insignificant
That isn't insignificant
That's not how I did that
That's not happening!
That isn't happening!
That's not even the best part!
That isn't even the best part!
That's not available
That isn't available
Thankfully, no one noticed
Thankfully, nobody noticed
Tell me you'll do that
Tell me that you'll do that
It's not safe in here
It isn't safe in here
It's not just the economy
It isn't just the economy
It seems it's still working
It isn't good to do that
It isn't as simple as that
It isn't as bad as all that
How do you tell someone that?
How do you tell somebody that?
That's not negotiable
That isn't negotiable
I'm glad Tom is healthy again
Tom hasn't been the same since
Is it malignant?
How did it break?
May I get ready?
My eyes met Tom's
It's very dirty
How are you coping?
Is Tom coming along?
Is it time for a change?
Isn't Tom angry yet?
It's really true
How does memory work?
My credit's good
Is that a for sale sign?
Is Tom on board, too?
It's fairly large
How generous is that?
Just keep going, Tom
Let's have Tom leave
How safe are opioids?
Is this holding us back?
How's life going now?
Let's just do that
Is this now a done deal?
How can I do anything?
Let's do that, shall we?
How did Tom change you?
Tom is going to return at 2:30
How about a compromise?
It's all thanks to Tom
It doesn't end well
Is it getting any easier?
Music is Tom's passion
How do you manage that?
Tom is likable, but Mary isn't
Is it too late to matter?
It's Tom who's the boss
It's extremely hard
How long can that last?
It's making Tom nervous
It's extremely long
Is it going to be painful?
Just hang in there, Tom
How long was your wait?
Is it true you're a thief?
My gaze locked on Tom's
How might this be done?
How does Tom plan to win?
Is one of you always late?
How does Tom deal with it?
How can that be correct?
How's Tom doing in Boston?
It wasn't a question
Is that doing us any good?
It wasn't deliberate
How did it come to this?
It'll make Tom very happy
It wasn't productive
Is that the whole picture?
Legally, Tom isn't guilty
It wasn't successful
How do I get in on this?
How did Tom earn the medal?
It's getting serious
Is there a way to do this?
How much more can Tom take?
It's getting smaller
How else can you put it?
It's totally amazing
Is there sufficient light?
It's very attractive
How far off can that be?
It's all Tom seems to have
Is this financial suicide?
How good are those jobs?
My mind's gone blank
Is this some type of joke?
How big a role did Tom play?
My wife died in 2013
How long can this go on?
How did Tom get Mary to lie?
Is this the break we need?
Tom is ready for that, I think
How long does that take?
It's just a meteorite
Isn't the time to buy now?
It's time to wait now
How will I pay the rent?
Is inflation a problem now?
Let's order out today
How are rates determined?
Let's hope Tom doesn't sing
Is it all right between us?
How could Tom be a terrorist?
How can they pull it off?
If Tom was hurt, I'd know it
Is it time for some change?
How did we sink this low?
It's Tom who's the boss here
Is that all there is to it?
It's not like Tom was rushed
How do you pass the time?
Is there a cure for cancer?
It won't happen to you
Tom isn't a man to trifle with
How much are the tickets?
It's a pain to do that
Tom isn't as important as I am
Is this what you voted for?
How big a star is Tom Jackson?
It's certainly unusual
Tom isn't as realistic as I am
How much should you walk?
How does Tom get away with it?
It's extremely painful
Tom isn't going to accept that
It's obviously strange
Tom isn't here to make friends
How old are you now, sir?
It's simply disgusting
Tom isn't likely to be curious
Is French difficult or easy?
No Tom, actually you're wrong
It's something serious
Tom isn't out of the woods yet
How about a round of golf?
It's something special
Tom isn't sure who to vote for
Is this an impossible dream?
How can you be successful?
Money's a little tight
Is this supposed to be news?
How could I agree to this?
Just how bad is this system?
How do I turn this around?
Is it time for something new?
How nice of you to come!
How do we get enough food?
It isn't what you think
Is that a hole in your pants?
How do you see the matter?
It's always interesting
Tom looks like he's determined
Is that all it comes down to?
It's entirely different
Tom looks like he's distracted
How do you train for that?
It's published annually
Is there anything left to do?
It's quite eye-catching
How far can we carry this?
It's really competitive
Is this really our best plan?
It's utterly ridiculous
Tom must've kissed Mary by now
How hard is it to be poor?
It's very disappointing
Is this the train for Boston?
It's wholly unnecessary
How have you been keeping?
Isn't that what they all say?
How much did you overhear?
Just how significant is that?
Tom really doesn't like to fly
How much will it sell for?
Is any of this ringing a bell?
How much will the toll be?
It's almost embarrassing
Is it always going to be free?
It's already challenging
How safe are e-cigarettes?
It's definitely exciting
Is it just a matter of timing?
It's no skin off my nose
Tom received the award in 2013
How are we paying for this?
It's totally meaningless
Is it really all that harmful?
How can that be a solution?
Tom retired at the end of 2013
Is that too much risk for you?
How can we learn from this?
It doesn't pay to do that
Is there enough room for them?
It looks like you're high
How did you get into radio?
Now what is this really about?
How do we cope with change?
It's absolutely fantastic
It's absolutely marvelous
How do you vent your anger?
It's absolutely wonderful
It's advisable to do that
How much fuel did you save?
It's almost revolutionary
It's already been checked
How much fun would that be?
It's completely plausible
It's completely voluntary
How much help is out there?
It's definitely happening
It's extremely gratifying
How much more do they want?
It's pretty icy out there
It's totally unbelievable
How often do you hear that?
How about I get you a drink?
How are we going to make it?
How are you psychologically?
How do I apologize for this?
How do you define true love?
It wasn't anything special
It's almost unclassifiable
How do you stay an optimist?
It's much too early to say
It's never easy to do that
How does that help our city?
It's really quite a crisis
It's something very unique
How hard is that to believe?
It's that time of the year
It's what I was born to do
How sustainable is all this?
How ugly is it going to get?
How bad is the crime problem?
How can it have come to this?
Tom was named chairman in 2013
My first wife died in 2013
How can you not respect them?
Odds are that won't happen
How could it have gone wrong?
Tom was touched by Mary's gift
How do the men feel about it?
How do we capitalize on that?
It's a pretty bad situation
Tom wasn't in a forgiving mood
How do you like your chances?
It's a pretty daunting task
Tom wasn't present at the time
How have I made a difference?
It's a question of legality
Tom wasn't quite himself today
How much alcohol is too much?
It's a very orderly process
Tom wasn't very self-conscious
How much do you think it was?
It's absolutely astonishing
How much money can you spend?
It's commercially available
How much would I have to pay?
It's completely devastating
How well would that work out?
It's definitely encouraging
How will the ban be enforced?
It's driving me up the wall
How will we pay the mortgage?
It's just one of those days
Tom will be Mary's next victim
How would you ever know that?
It's water under the bridge
How can I complain about that?
How can voters be so ignorant?
How can we capitalize on that?
Maybe you'd better not sing
How can we not listen to them?
How did they get away with it?
How do you capitalize on that?
How very nice of you to come!
How do you start your morning?
How does one prepare for that?
It's a common sense approach
How does that even make sense?
It's a very delicate balance
How many people die every day?
It's been a long time coming
How much French can you speak?
It's certainly a distraction
How much profit do you expect?
It's hard to even comprehend
How would you respond to that?
It's just a personal project
It's working out really well
Let's put an ad in the paper
Tom won't come to live with us
Tom won't forgive me so easily
Tom won't likely be displeased
Odds are it'll rain tomorrow
Tom won't likely be downstairs
Our goal isn't to make money
Tom won't likely be optimistic
Tom won't likely be supportive
Tom won't likely be unemployed
Tom won't risk hurting himself
It'll be good to see everyone
It's a cost of doing business
It's a nice day
Let's go out
It's absolutely unprecedented
Tom wouldn't take me seriously
It's completely beyond repair
It's completely irresponsible
It's hard for me to come here
Tom's comments were misleading
It's more important than ever
Tom's death wasn't an accident
It's very nice of you to come
Tom's marriage is on the rocks
It's what I would've expected
Tom's trial lasted three weeks
Tom's trial was held in Boston
It'll be snowing in Boston now
It's because I like to do that
It's completely understandable
It's very simple and intuitive
There's no way that's possible
I'm sure Tom isn't happy here
It's obvious Tom wants to die
My guess is Tom won't do that
Of course, Tom goes to school
That's something Tom can't do
That's what Tom did yesterday
That's what Tom is paid to do
That's where Tom is right now
That's why Tom didn't do that
Trust me, Sami
Let's play this game
That's what bartering means
Where are the fish?
Don't worry
This is her son, Sami
What a handsome young man!
This party isn't for you
It's not her birthday
Your father wants you, Sami
That's what I call a bike
What is aventurine?
Do you like Spain?
Do you like France?
Do you like Germany?
What is carnelian?
Is carnelian a flower?
Did you think was a fair move?
Did you think I was blind?
Did you say that you did that?
Did you know Tom couldn't win?
Did you know Tom wouldn't win?
Did you know Tom would win?
Did you know it was time?
Did you know that it was time?
Did Tom give a gun to Mary?
Cut off Tom's hair
Cut Tom's hair off
Are you certain Tom ate?
Are you certain that Tom ate?
Tom admitted he wasn't perfect
Tom admitted he wasn't certain
Tom admitted he wasn't brave
Tom admitted he didn't cry
Are you saying Tom was busy?
Are you sure Tom cheated?
Are you sure that Tom cheated?
Are you sure Tom ate?
Are you sure that Tom ate?
Are you certain Tom cheated?
It turned out Tom wasn't alone
It's a good thing Tom did that
That's something Tom has to do
Hey, don't run in the hallway
Have you ever been in therapy?
Don't you trust me to do that?
Does that make you feel smart?
Does it pay to stay in school?
Do you really want me to sing?
Do you like this sort of book?
Do you know what crawdads are?
Do you follow any other sport?
Do you fight with your family?
Do you feel lucky to be alive?
Do we really know one another?
Didn't I go over that already?
Did you ever try running away?
Did someone die in this house?
Can't we just love each other?
Can someone give me an answer?
Can old dogs learn new tricks?
Are you starting to get ready?
Are you seeing a pattern here?
Are you in favor of this idea?
Have we changed the schedule?
Give me back my book, please
Don't we need a lot of money?
Doesn't that sort of get you?
Does this concern you at all?
Does it come with a warranty?
Do you want to shoot the gun?
Do you want to be a princess?
Do you have any new projects?
Do you have an Android phone?
Do you have a different view?
Do you go through red lights?
Do you agree with the ruling?
Do we really trust our peers?
Do they have a plan for that?
Didn't I ask you not to sing?
Did you see the guy that won?
Did someone turn up the heat?
As I said, we have a problem
Aren't you getting a new car?
Aren't you getting a divorce?
Am I making any sense at all?
Am I getting ahead of myself?
Have you used it since then?
Have you set a wedding date?
Everything's happening here
Don't take it too seriously
Don't I wish that were true?
Doing that wouldn't be good
Does it need to be this way?
Do you still have that view?
Do you remember any of this?
Do you realize what you did?
Do you have a plan for that?
Do we need all of the above?
Did you have to take a test?
Crime isn't the major issue
Could you explain to me why?
Could we visit Boston again?
Can you still squeeze me in?
Can you still drive me home?
Can someone help us, please?
Can I go to school tomorrow?
Can I go out tomorrow night?
Aren't you getting all this?
Are your parents relocating?
Are you really charging $30?
Are there people who use it?
Have you sent for a doctor?
Have you filed a grievance?
Have you ever wondered how?
Has it all been worthwhile?
Does it ever happen to you?
Does any of that sound bad?
Do you work in the evening?
Do you want to turn around?
Do you have a waiting list?
Do we need to control this?
Can't we just have a drink?
Can you define that for me?
Can we get out of this jam?
Can we afford to lose that?
Aren't you dancing tonight?
Are you still a journalist?
Are you still a Republican?
Has all the hype paid off?
First day on the job, huh?
Don't you get tired of it?
Does your band need a van?
Does it matter in the end?
Do you want to see a show?
Do you want to believe it?
Do you still wear glasses?
Do you own this place now?
Do you like being with me?
Don't expect any less from Tom
Do you know your ancestry?
Do you guys see something?
Do you even read the news?
Do we ever really grow up?
Do I need to spell it out?
Can we afford to be wrong?
Can reform be a bad thing?
Can I keep it in the boat?
Are you in the flood zone?
Have you changed Tom's diaper?
Are you guys ready for it?
Are you getting any sleep?
Are we ready for the rain?
Are we on the right track?
Are we going to update it?
Are video games addictive?
Embarrassed, Tom backed away
Are they going to go west?
And now what are we to do?
Can you still make Tom smile?
Am I going to have a baby?
Can you still make Tom laugh?
Have you called them yet?
Don't you feel important?
Doesn't that cause chaos?
Aren't you interested in Tom?
Do you need most of them?
Do you love this country?
Do you feel up to a chat?
Do you ever speak French?
Did you sleep last night?
Did you interrogate them?
Could you expand on that?
Could this get any worse?
Can I test drive the car?
Can I express my opinion?
Are you stoned right now?
Are you still overweight?
Today, Tom's life is good
Are you not exaggerating?
Are you a big sports fan?
Don't ask me to kiss Tom
Are there better options?
Did you have to kiss Tom?
Don't speak French here
Do you know how to kiss?
Do you know a good cook?
Can you still hear them?
Don't ask me to hug Tom
Can you still hear that?
Can we still get a loan?
Can someone clue Tom in?
Can I get on this plane?
Are you happy to see me?
Are there any discounts?
Did you really hug Tom?
Do you ever go running?
Can I do that with Tom?
Could I get some juice?
Aren't you at home now?
Don't make me hug Tom
Does it happen to you?
Do I look like a fool?
Did Tom tell you this?
Come at 2:30 tomorrow
Can I get my job back?
Here's what happened
Here's some evidence
At last, Tom appeared
Don't just ignore me
Has Tom reported it?
Do you hurt anywhere?
Can a deal be struck?
Are you standing now?
Are you in the area?
Did Tom hug Mary?
Here's the kitchen
Don't eat my fries
Did Tom admit it?
Tom almost didn't cry
Are you like Tom?
Aren't you at work?
Are you contagious?
Don't you do that?
Do that, will you?
Do it, Tom
Can you go alone?
Can I touch this?
That's why Tom stayed with us
Why did you hug Tom yesterday?
Why isn't Tom married already?
Why wouldn't Tom come tonight?
How many plumbers do you know?
Tom must've been dreaming
Hopefully, Tom doesn't do that
I can't believe Tom wrote this
Did you that know already?
I didn't like Tom at that time
I'm in the same club as Tom is
Tom shouldn't be drinking
If Tom does that, I'll hit him
It's amazing how Tom does that
Don't make me eat this
Perhaps Tom could've done more
Tom wouldn't discuss that
Has that ever happened to you?
That's what Tom was paid to do
Tom didn't bother me today
There's nothing Tom can't do
We're about to go swimming
Would you like to join us?
Tom doesn't cry very often
Tom had open-heart surgery
Did they all go to Boston?
Tom hasn't let us down yet
Tom isn't going to testify
Tom should've stayed quiet
Why did you choose to do that?
Tom didn't open any windows
Do you still drive a blue car?
That's particularly alarming
That's one way of putting it
Tom didn't try to stop Mary
Didn't you do that on Monday?
How exactly do you do that?
Tom hasn't been cooperating
How did this sand get here?
How can you be so gullible?
How can people be so cruel?
Tom is awfully good-looking
How will you pay for this?
Did you get there in time?
It'll be easy to do this
Should we do that first?
Shouldn't we do that first?
Is there another option?
Am I obliged to do that?
Tom might've been kidnapped
That's pretty powerful
A neighbor heard Tom's screams
That's pretty exciting
That's pretty dramatic
That's our arrangement
Should we do that now?
It's too hot to sleep
How much is the toll?
Do you have a backup?
That's believable
Why are all the statues naked?
Do you truly love Tom?
May we meet in reality?
Tom's feeling a little peckish
You know nothing, Tom Jackson
Come, boy, learn to be wise
Who will teach me this?
Who will teach this to me?
I will, with God's help.
Didn't you notice that?
The crow cries 'aa aa'
The lamb bleats 'baa'
The Hoopoe says 'doo doo'
The baby cries 'eh eh eh'
Do you have other books?
What did you see in Rome?
What did you see in Paris?
What did you see in London?
Mum's working
Mummy's working
Mary can't trust Tom
I don't think I have a problem
I have no doubt that'll happen
I have to say I'm astonished
I'm 100 percent sure of that
I'm 100% sure of that
I don't think it's too serious
I'm glad that you did that
I don't think Tom complained
I don't think we can do it
Tom probably won't help you
Tom said he's quit drinking
Tom would know, wouldn't he?
Tom didn't forget to do that
Tom didn't seem very relaxed
Tom doesn't worry about that
Tom has decided to re-enlist
Tom is hoping that'll happen
Tom is staying at a friend's
I'm very happy to be in Boston
Tom looks like he's troubled
I'm not really sure what to do
I'll be here tomorrow, I think
I thank God that didn't happen
I can't sit still for too long
I can vote against it, I guess
I think we're making progress
I don't want to get into that
I don't care about that stuff
We're planning for the worst
We're considering doing that
We're actually working on it
I'm not sure they'll survive
I still don't sleep at night
We're going to be all right
It's obviously not over yet
I'm very concerned about it
I'm very proud of our team
I don't go home very often
I don't go home that often
I'm very proud of my team
I'll enjoy it while I can
I'm enjoying it while I can
We don't anticipate that
That's the key question
It's tough to say why
Tom couldn't sleep on the bus
I'm proud to be on this team
I'm going to miss my teammates
Tom didn't say where Mary was
It wasn't fair to Mary at all
I'm glad no one is around
Do you read Arabic?
I don't have tattoos
I don't have a daddy
She doesn't like cartoons
She's growing up
Do you have any gigs lined up?
Is this your new drummer?
Sami's girlfriend left him
Sami isn't helping
How are you going to vote?
Sami is Layla's brother
Sami can't challenge Layla
Sami called me "clumsy.
Sami can't remember
Sami doesn't remember
Sami isn't here
Sami can't talk to Layla
So many heads, so many minds
I'm sorry Tom thinks that way
I hope I don't start crying
It's the best we can do
It's the best that we can do
I know Tom wouldn't do that
I thought you couldn't read
I think we've done well
I think that we've done well
I think we'll be back soon
I think that that's true
I think that's inevitable
I think that that's inevitable
I think it's pretty good
I think that it's pretty good
I think you'll enjoy it here
I think I've seen this before
I think they'll have a chance
I think we'll survive
I think that we'll survive
I think I'm going to do that
I think we've made progress
I think it's all been worth it
I think it's time to go
I think that it's time to go
I think it's a cool idea
I think that it's a cool idea
I think we've learned a lot
I think you're terrific
I think that you're terrific
I think you'll agree
I think that you'll agree
I think I could've done that
I think that's a little unfair
I'm glad I came back
I'm glad that I came back
I'm glad I said that
I'm glad that I said that
I'm glad you're back in Boston
I'm glad we decided to do this
I guess it'll have to wait
I promised that I'd do that
We're glad you weren't injured
I wasn't told I needed a visa
Tom promised he'd speak French
Tom shouldn't have known that
Tom didn't eat pizza yesterday
Tom doesn't actually hate Mary
Tom doesn't actually live here
Tom has had open-heart surgery
Tom isn't a trustworthy person
Tom moved to Australia in 2013
Tom shouldn't be working today
Tom wouldn't talk to reporters
We don't expect that to happen
That's what scared me the most
That's definitely not the plan
We weren't allowed to do that
Today's going to be a big day
They haven't contacted us yet
That's why we need to protest

Meanwhile, time is running out
Do you like the mountain?
I'm dying to go to the toilet
May I take a message?
How young you are!
I'm not completely in accord
May I be of help in any way?
Stout fellow you are, bro!
Luxurious place!
Here's the leader!
Where do you want us to go?
I'm dying to meet her
I leave you, fellow-thinker
Oh, like that!
Ah, so!
It's a horse
It's not a horse
Don't get so angry
I don't brush their hair
I'm not petting their dog
I'm not breaking their glasses
I don't sing to them
I don't heat their house
Go ahead of me!
I'm also learning Amharic
I'm getting sleepy
I guess you don't like him
Rubbish!
Got any beer?
What can we say?
I can't take no more!
How is your new class?
You can't help but like Tom
Congrats!
Wanna come along?
I'm bad at writing sentences
The death toll is nearly 500
Ah!
I can't go dancing with you.
Bummer.
Ah!
I won't let that happen again

That's a painter

He speaks too fast!
I'm on good terms with her
Clearly, he's guilty
What does a room cost?
It is Anita's house
It's a beautiful story
I'm out!
It's a mere drop in the ocean
Is it a girl or a boy?
Tom is wicked, isn't he?
I believe that's it for now
I got no money, though
Where is his dog?
Where is her dog?
I believe that's all I need
I haven't been drinking
Can you get there fast?
Shall we eat anything?
I didn't know you were awake
There's no shortage of work
Do you love it?
You have a minute?
Yes, why?
Why is love so hard?
Is your wife at home?
Good, I will do my best
How much does this watch cost?
Are you curious?
Did you happen to meet him?
Hey!
A bee stung me!
What to do!
Ask someone's hand
Shall we drink to that?
Ouch!
Tom didn't want to believe me
So, you're not coming?
Yes, I swear to this
Where is your money?
I'm waiting for you to help me
I don't waste anything
Very!
Now it's too late
We're on Interstate 11
I don't feel safe here
She doesn't live here anymore
You're as guilty as him
You've won my heart
You've won her heart
Sounds good!
Do you want to see him again?
I'm not stupid, am I?
Tláloc likes travelling
Tláloc likes to travel
I'm not frightened of ghosts
Can I help in any way?
With whom do you live?
Do I have to do it already?
Do I have to do it right now?
Why was Tom fired?
Why do you have to go?
I'm not an early riser
He's self centered
Did he iron his pants?
May I turn off the light?
Do you know what I'm saying?
I think I need a stiff drink.
Make that two.
Tomorrow will be better!
Excuse me, can I join you?
If you were gone, I'd die
Do you prefer cats or dogs?
There's someone for everyone
Trust me, I'm a doctor
It's really disgusting
They didn't achieve their goal
It's not
Tom, will you stop it
Will you stop it already!
Tom, will you stop it already!
Tom's lawn needs mowing
Tom mowed Mary's lawn for her
I'm fine, mom
What are you trying to do?
Drive me insane?
Tom drives his parents' car
He's a good driver
I understand what she's saying
Hey, are you there?
Can you hear me?
Are you not feeling well?
I dreamed of you yesterday.
Seriously?
And what was I doing?
Ah, I forgot to buy tofu
I laughed my head off!
That's my hobby
Have a good dream!
That's far out!
The bus is broken!
Is the bus broken?
Don't let me be misunderstood
I told you that!
What was it supposed to mean?
Where did you find her photo?
Where did you find his photo?
We don't need money
Don't touch my car
Want to play tit for tat ?
I'm in a bad mood
Have you decided already?
Beat me up!
You've got to be kidding.
Yes!
Good.
You've fallen asleep
You are a terrible person.
Gosh!
You're still awake.
Shut up and listen.
You can't tell me what to do
You don't sing very well
Save me, Dr. Rabbit!
No.
Oh!
Attack, children!
Go away!
But I don't want to!
Why didn't you help him?
I'm not doing anything now
It's hail stoning
It's sunny
I'll take you to school
I'll take you back to school
About time too!
About whom was he commenting?
And what?
Is he sure?
A girl drinks the fish's water
Is that really science?
Who will believe this?
Mercy, not to Siberia!
No mercy, to Siberia!
What can I do for my image?
Don't act like you don't care
He's fading away
He's dying
He's on his last leg

From your lips to God's ears
I tried but didn't succeed

I'll see you next week!
Thanks for coming, guys!
I'll see you tomorrow!
Thanks for coming, guys!
See you around!
Thanks for coming, guys!
I'll see you next class!
Would you abandon me?
Tom wasn't able to do it
When does that start?
Are you leaving soon?
I can't tell her now
It's not that simple
I can't tell him now
It's not that simple
Don't make me say it twice
Everything's coming up roses
I'm sorry
He's allergic to pollen
How did Tom solve the problem?
I hope it'll be quiet
Am I on the right track?
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
How big is your garden?
Don't speak to me in Arabic
It doesn't make sense to me
I'd like to live in Brazil
I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow
I'm watching a movie
Don't forget to call your mom
They're up to no good
Don't forget your toothbrush
Tom's door was partially open
Is this man threatening you?
Was this man threatening you?
I couldn't contain my anger
I tried again at 2:00 p.m
Now I'm a little scared
How can I sell myself?
Are Tom and Mary lovers?
I'm not a member of the club
Do you play squash?
I think I've found a meteorite
She's not human

Happy Birthday, Romania!
There's cake
Would you like some?
Yeah!
Have you sat the maths exam?
Do you happen to know him?
I haven't learnt a lot
It's carbon or soot
I was walking, not driving
You're trying to confuse me
Oh, no!
Do it this way!
Why do you treat me like this?
It's very cold here in January
I won't be wearing a tie
Do you want to live in Madrid?
I wouldn't drive, I'd walk
Where did you see these women?
Could you explain it to me?
Make sure you don't get lost
Animals are not toys!
They'll buy something
How much do you like Tom?
Don't be pigs
When does No.4 bus arrive?
He's not as good as he thinks
I'm not drinking tonight
My gums won't stop bleeding
I love teaching kids Spanish!
Who will console me?
Who will console him?
Who will console her?
What are you snacking on?
Do you have to rent a car?
There weren't any cats
You're making me feel tired
I'll read this book
Does Germany export grain?
This company's CEO is a woman
Did I say something stupid?
Did I do something stupid?
I don't even know how to dance
Tom wasn't there yesterday
They'll get along just fine
Is this your room?
Do you believe in aliens?
Do you understand?
No, I don't.
How many apples did you buy?
It's a big responsibility
What's Boston really like?
I'll try to say it in French
I know that you aren't stupid
We don't get along very well
Tom used to get up before 6:30
Artemis is Apollo's sister
Who abducted Persephone?
I'm dyeing my hair black
Patience is a virtue..
It's no skin off my nose
I wonder if she'll be there
Did you speak to anybody?
The world isn't perfect
This really ticks me off!
Tom is a deep-sea diver
I only had five or six.
I'm not begging you
I won't beg you
I'll be happy to go
I would've said the same thing
It's very unlikely
I'm convinced Tom is innocent
I'm convinced Tom is guilty
They say so" is half a lie
I'm a bit shy
Can I have one, too?
My family isn't rich
My family's not rich
I shouldn't have trusted you
It's getting late
There's a full moon tonight
There's no air on the moon
What's Tom doing in his room?
Do you know what an e-book is?
We like it very much!
What is your store like?
What are the rooms like?
What do I need to know?
And what happened after that?
And what happened after that?
I can't tell you
It's a secret.
Tom said he wouldn't do it
Don't worry
I won't tell Tom
Don't worry
I won't tell Mary
It's mine!
I don't care.
Tom, give me a minute
Tom doesn't need to know that
I've lost my briefcase
I don't have time to help
I don't have time to help Tom
I'll come tomorrow
I have an appointment at 2:30
What's making this sound?
What's this sound?
Give me a receipt, please
I give up!
Aren't you pregnant?
Well, stop drinking then!
This doesn't affect him at all
I'm trying to learn English
I'm thinking of changing jobs
I'm looking for another job
You're a terrible person
That isn't exactly what I said
Does Tom like his job?
Are you Tom's mother?
I knew they were lying!
Don't talk to him that way
Don't talk to her that way
Don't talk to him that way
He's my friend
Don't talk to her that way
She's my friend
Do you think he's in trouble?
Do you think she's in trouble?
Don't spit on the walls
It's the way it must be
At what time do you finish?
I'm clumsy
How much do you love Tom?
Divide this into halves!
Halve that!
Does he like his job ?
Does he like his job?
What's Tom looking for?
I'm impressed with your French
Off with the dots !
Where will you go next?
Remind me to check!
I'd never do such a thing
Which fly bit you?
He's not a religious man
He's not a religious person
He's not religious
It's so beautiful
Where did you get it?
It's so beautiful!
Where did you get it?
Stop playing games, Tom
Stop playing games, Tom
I want my money!
Why is she being so quiet?
Why is she so quiet?
Maybe he was in an accident?
That's a pathetic excuse
He called to say he'd be late
What's his professor's name?
The sun is yellow.
He's on the phone right now
Should I pay for you?
You'll need their help
He's interested in math
He's interested in mathematics
Not bad at all!
May I suggest another hotel?
I don't want to pressure you
May I suggest another idea?
May I suggest another option?
May I make another suggestion?
How do I turn this off?
Oh friends, not these tones!
Tom's mother was heartbroken
Tom wasn't badly injured
What's changed since then?
Let's not deceive ourselves
What did Tom put into the bag?
What's her professor's name?
Tom's prone to exaggeration
I'm not surprised by this
This doesn't surprise me
What's her teacher's name?
Don't talk to me about him
Don't talk to me about her
What if someone catches us?
There's someone waiting for me
There's someone waiting for me
Let me pass by!
You're being missed so much
I've forgotten her name
That's nothing
People don't want to die
What did he tell you about me?
She's eating something
What maggot bites you?
Today, I'm not going to school
Draw me a sheep..
She's like my own daughter
I will, but on one condition
Today is Wednesday, yes?
My name isn't on the list
It's starting to snow
Don't buy me any more presents
I don't have a book
Who helped Tom?
Does she sing?
I'm not Brazilian
Also, I can fly
Yes, I'll call you at nine
Will you be there?
I'm a changed man
I can't talk to you here
She's a remarkable young lady
I'm a different man
I'd do anything for you, Mary
I think you've had enough, Tom
She is stunningly good-looking
Tom is stunningly good-looking
Don't tell him I told you
Don't tell her I told you
Don't tell Mary I told you
That is fine.
I'm feeling uncomfortable
I'm feeling uneasy
We bought this car for 12,000
May I call you tonight?
Sure.
What I've done is unforgivable
What's Tom trying to do?
He doesn't have his medicine
I will go, even if it rains
I don't need beds
Where do you use it?
Who is my father?
Would you like ice cream?
Don't smoke in bed!
Are you talking?
Does she have a dog?
Ellen doesn't speak Welsh
What is Tom reading?
He is screaming, not singing
I have flu and I'm tired
What's the matter, love?
Don't tell lies!
I'm too short
Is this clock working?
Does she have a lover?
Has he got money?
I don't watch television
Hi, how are you?
What is your name?
Why did you leave your job?
Do you know Mr Bingley?
What time are you going?
There are two zeroes in "2010
It is seven o'clock
I don't think we can trust her
I don't think we can trust him
Have fun!
Can we do this another time?
Why did you guys break up?
Don't worry about it
You'll be fine
You've opened a window
Wait, what is this?
I'm very ashamed of it
I can't remember exactly
I'm just a normal person
I'm just a normal girl
I'm just a normal guy
Don't forget your coat
I'm waiting at the door
I'll wait at the door
Is Tom wounded?
I lol'd

Why did you agree to help her?
Why did you agree to help Tom?
It's okay
File a police report!
Hey, man!
What's up?
I can't speak a word of German
Tom Miller.
Is that stereotype true?
Where were you?
I went shopping.
Don't sit on the counter
I saw them making out!
Are you sure it was him?
Are you sure it was her?
Are you sure it was them?
What's up with you two?
Is this blackmail?
It's fun because it's random!
You can't have both
What if someone finds out?
Tom's a nice guy
She's way out of your league
He's way out of your league
Do you know that?
Are you a maniac?
Do you find that funny?
Did you bring it home?
Did you bring this home?
Why have you been avoiding me?
I'll call you soon
What is Rob like?
What will you wear?
So where does he live?
She didn't take a siesta

That's why he did it

Is anybody with me?
Is the world unjust?
It's Anna's house
Are you enjoying the city?
Don't throw stones at the dog
How is her surname pronounced?
How is his surname pronounced?
I've got the jack of hearts
Rubles!
Now I'm home
My shoe size is 45
Shall we go soon?
It is their problem, not ours
Can you show me one more time?
I can't see anything
You're standing in the way
Can't you stay a while longer?
It's nothing to be sorry about
Are you completely crazy?
I'm gonna change it right now
He's a foreigner
Can you deal with it?
It's been recommended to me
I don't slice their bread
I don't cut their hair
What is Maths good for?
Would you like another beer?
His wife's a friend of mine
He's just not that into you
Hurry up, girl!
He's kicked out
Don't eat fast food!
Did you pass your exams?
I'm sorry, I do not understand
Next time, I'll drive
They lost again.
You don't say
What's that, eight in a row?
Play the ball, not the man
Don't look at it!
How can I serve you?
That's another issue
I'm full of joy
It's getting chilly
I think he didn't understand
There's his friend
There he is!
There's still a bit of it left
Do you know this girl?
I don't cut her hair
I've downloaded some stuff
Why did you come here, then?
I'm boring
You need a taxi, don't you?
You're the boss!
You're the doctor!
We'll destroy their dens
Keep calm, you're the boss
I don't slice her bread
That's a bodge job
I don't like her at all
Is there water on Mars?
Are you upset?
In spring, the days get longer

Honestly, I really like you
Oh, I forgot my keys
They're not French
Death to the king!
Can I add you on Facebook?
May I add you on Facebook?
Please be quiet!
That's just wishful thinking
Do you wanna play?
Why do you spoil him?
She's from Portugal
They're from Iceland
It's their problem, not ours
Was that the problem?
Was that your question?
They're from Greece
He's very religious
I don't teach them to swim
I'm a little sick
Stand and deliver!
Welcome, Meruert
You don't have to try
Why don't you come to Boston?
Today is history!
As you wish!
I can't live alone
Should we prepare anything?
May God give them peace!
Here, this present is for you.
Ram's table is besides mine
I can't right now
I'm busy
I'm not home Sundays
What's wrong with Tom?
Can any of us speak Spanish?
Is there any more of that?
Defend yourself!
That's not an insult
Now I'm a doctor too
I have no clue what I'm doing
I don't know what I did at all
I can't wait to meet this girl
Is this seat still open?
What is a slogan?
I don't have enough strength.
Let me do that.
I don't buy it
Don't you like that?
Do you really not like them?
These are hard times, I know
I don't want to grow up
He's too mature for you
Pineapple.
But sir—" "Pine
Apple.
I couldn't restrain myself
I can't seem to get it to work
That's a pretty lame joke
Do I need a reservation?
Nine o'clock should be O.K
Why are you saying that to me?
Don't you love each other?
Shall we live here or there?
How did you pull it off?
You don't talk a lot
A merry Christmas, uncle!
Bah!" said Scrooge, "Humbug!
You don't mean that, I am sure
You don't mean that, I'm sure
Merry Christmas!
Stay where you are!
Don't be angry, uncle
Come!
Because I fell in love.
Good afternoon, gentlemen!
Why do you doubt your senses?
Hear me!" cried the Ghost
My time is nearly gone.
Was it a dream or not?
Who, and what are you?
Marley was dead: to begin with
Nothing," said Scrooge
Look upon me!
God bless us!
There's nowhere you can hide
It's too hard for me
Ha, ha, ha!
Scrooge knew he was dead?
How could it be otherwise?
Do you know who her father is?
Do you know who his father is?
I don't care about anyone else
You're too good for him
You're too good for her
Do you know that girl?
Do you know that guy?
It wasn't what it looked like
It's not what it looks like
We need air support!
I can't wait to go to college
That's my last word
Excuse me, ladies!
That affair doesn't concern me
I know what it is, Fred!
I know what it is!
When did he die?
Last night, I believe.
Today!" replied the boy
Why, Christmas Day.
Good morning, sir!
A merry Christmas to you!
See you tomorrow then!
Just in time!
You the man!
We're all Toms and Marys
I can't play Flappy Bird
I won't go to school
Does Emily have green eyes?
He didn't deserve to die
Can you do that here?
It's because of me, isn't it?
Can you do me a favor?
It depends.
Are they going out?
It's not like that anymore
No soliciting!
You're playing in the garden
He's playing in the garden
She's playing in the garden
We're playing in the garden
They're playing in the garden
In fact, I do have a request
Tom won't be singing
I don't have a reason to live
You're too laid back
It's dry
I'll give you a laptop
I'd never been so afraid
What do you want to know?
Everything.
I didn't trust him at first
I didn't trust her at first
It's no longer that way
Who's free?
Tom doesn't know the truth
I don't belong to them
I was up until about 2:30.
I don't have a house
Tom, how could you?
He's no longer my friend
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.
Do not disturb my circles!
But how about up and down?
It's beautifully made
He didn't give it to me
Don't go away
I'm starving for a bit of meat
And the salt.
The Time Machine was gone!
Where is my Time Machine?
Where is my time machine?
You see?
It wasn't that bad
What about dessert?
Can I take a break?
Can I take a break now?
Are these all Tom's books?
Are these all your books, Tom?
We were up until about 2:30.
It won't amount to anything
How many books have you got?
Don't go
You call that music?
To me it's no more than noise
Wait, did you say girl or guy?
What a strange coincidence!
What a marvelous suggestion!
Tom retired at the age of 65
You're the one with the Ph.D
Let's see some ID
We have a history, Tom and I
I guess that'd be OK
Tom doesn't need an SUV
That's usually not a good idea
I'm starting to get the idea
That's the whole idea
That's the general idea
That's such a cool idea
That's your idea
Tom's got the right idea
It's a moral gray area
I've studied your data
I'll run it over to the lab
I'm the one who has the job
That's part of our job
You've done a brilliant job
Let's just take a sec
It's too public
I'm only the mechanic
That's very dramatic
It'd be bad
You know, this isn't half bad
I've been real bad
You're not so bad
It's really not so bad
We're as good as dead
Don't put ideas in Tom's head
I've called ahead
I don't know what I had
I've got boxes to unload
You're all over the road
Tom's suitcase is on the bed
I'm putting the boy to bed
Tom's fate is already decided
You're completely surrounded
Tips aren't included
Tom didn't succeed
You've got mouths to feed
I've been fully briefed

Served you right!
I've lost your email address
I should've known that
I knew you couldn't wait
What is sporting your son?
I'm going to make you a drink
I swear it couldn't be sweeter
I'm soaked to the bone
What is an Anglicism?
Do they watch TV?
You're mortal
It isn't Roman
It's all in your head
I'm keeping my mouth shut
She's hiding something from me
Who's Tom speaking to?
They're back from China
We're back from China
Marie's back from China
She's back from China
They've gone out to eat
Do they hate me?
It's of the Jōhō Shinsei sect
She's a bit of a handful
She's quite a handful
I'm working in your house only
You're not getting dressed
He's like the "Esperanto Man.
Get a cat!
Walk around!
You shouldn't hate people
For what are you waiting?
I can tell you're a northerner
People haven't yet escaped it
We don't have problems
I like "feijoada
Look at how worn out he is!
Don't brag!
It makes you sound poorer!
You just look like a janitor!
I'm not making that up
Not at all, nobody is
I'm getting there
Are you mad at Tom?
Who's worried about Tom?
I'm not a native speaker
Why?
What's the difference?
He weighs 80 kilos
Shh!
Don't make a sound
What is your ethnicity?
Zamboangueño!
How old are you?
I'm already 17 years old.
Someone pushed us in.
Sorry, I really have no idea.
Hello!
How are you?
Good Morning!
How are you all?
Try to tolerate!
It's like having a dog
I don't like their language
I don't like her language
I don't like your language
I don't like his language
How?
When?
How many?
So what's a candlestick?
My watch isn't working well
Quiet down!
From where are you?
Kill all murderers!
Arrest the police!
Try to be strong!
Tom's reply was evasive
There's been a burglary
It's time to feed the baby
Don't just stand there
It's an unusual name
Why am I so nervous?
Tom's in trouble again
It's not really my cup of tea
Is that blood?
There's smell of naphtha
Often, it's just the opposite
She won't forget this
No, it'll be next Monday.
Are you tired?
Not really.
Hey, don't give up!
You can do it!
Thanks a lot, teacher!
Was it an earthquake?
Don't give up yet
I'm sure you can do it
Tomorrow's your day off
Are they just random things?
Be proud of your nerdhood!
A wonderful view, isn't it?
Will you be home for dinner?
Tom ransacked Mary's house
Tom met Mary in 1972
Tom fell for Mary's charms
Tom's father was very well-off
Tom's family was torn apart
Tom's father was a drinker
Why did Tom kill Mary?
Tom didn't act alone
What drove Tom to kill Mary?
Could it have been Tom?
Someone knocked on Tom's door
Tom murdered his son-in-law
Tom's ordeal was far from over
Tom's future remains uncertain
Tom's father was a cruel man
Tom didn't follow the rules
Tom's practice soon took off
That's why Tom was hated
Tom was a church-going man
Tom drove home at 2:30
What Tom did wasn't illegal
Tom doesn't regret what he did
Tom didn't pull the trigger
Tom disappeared in 2003
Tom's shift starts at midnight
Tom clocked out at 2:30
Tom picked up but didn't talk
Tom searched Mary's room
Is your prepuce like a vagina?
Do you feel guilty?
You think it's feminine
Do you think Santa exists?
I think it's nobody's fault
Don't bother me anymore
I'll be done in five minutes
What day of the week is it?
It's Wednesday.
I don't want to remain here
I'll leave it to you
He's from a foreign country
If he's going, I'm going too
Stop bullying me!
Quit your bullying!
She's a talented singer
He ignored his mother's advice
The bathroom window was open.
He's gotten old, too
He said he's been there before
Someone's dog disappeared
Early to bed, early to rise
What day is it?
It's Wednesday.
Tom isn't indispensable
Don't even hope
A car, you say!
What's wrong with him?
My dog's name is Belysh
I don't use Facebook
Do you fancy anyone?
Can you ice skate?
Are you good at ice skating?
Who taught you how to skate?
I'm a bit of an open book
Doesn't that smell fantastic?
Yeah!
You're sleepy, so go to bed
I'll be 30 this October
Get it out, get it out!
Oops, my fault
It's 3000 yen, not 3000 euros
Gosh, I'm 25 years old now
Isn't that horrible?
Rounding up, I'm 30!
Hey, I just had a good idea
I'm sorry
Bread?
Rice?
Either one is fine.
It's not in the usual place?
Yeah, I checked.
You're still up?
Do you hate me?
No.
So do you love me?
Why are you asking?
Do you want any?
You don't like alcohol?
Yeah, that guy.
Well, how was it?
Pain, pain, go away
Rain, rain, go away
Mom, hurry up!
Everyone's waiting
It's eight-thirty
It's 8:30
Come and dance with me!
Tom couldn't help her
Tom couldn't help him
Are you friend or foe?
Damn!
Please, don't do it
Is that Mrs. Kent?
I've bought some cream puffs
Do you want one?
I'm sorry
I was in awe of Tom's courage
Alright, see you then
Where are you going on Monday?
I'm gonna call the police!
Is that scientifically proven?
My mother wouldn't stop crying
Are we being chased?
How to start this motorcycle?
Sorry, I really have no idea.
I didn't know you felt so bad
He couldn't believe her story
You as well, child
Let's play Mario Bros
Wait a minute!
Whose hair is this?!
Yeah, just in case
I was thinking the same thing.
Was that a weird thing to ask?
No, no
It's not that.
I hope you get well soon!
Would you mind sharing yours?
I haven't slept in two days
Stop frowning!
Dora wants to learn about Dào
Try to help out!
It's cold in my city, Varsovia
I wonder what's inside the box
A tear ran down Tom's cheek
Really?
Well, at least to me it is.
What use does economics have?
Did something good happen?
May I use that?
Is it OK if I use that?
This is the worst!
Who needs friends!
He's a hero
How did you get injured?
What caused these injuries?
How did you get hurt so badly?
My computer won't boot up
They're just rubbish
Taxi, Follow that car!
I can't, it's illegal
What is a man without ideals?
Wow, that's great
Yeah!
How can I get taller?
Did you buy cat food?
Hello!
Can you hear me?
Is that a veiled threat?
That was a strange dream.
What happened?
Is Tom about?
He's not here!
Did you just say something?
No, I didn't say anything.
What're you making?
It's pumpkin soup.
Hey, Tom.
I'm sorry.
I'll come again.
Yeah, I look forward to it.
I'm 30.
What did I do to deserve that?
The snow is piled up outside.
Really!?
Who doesn't do that?
Man, this luggage is heavy!
Of course I did!
What, for me?!
Thank you!
Why do you hate me so much?
Because you are a brute!
Tom!
Oh how I've missed you.
At last we meet again.
I can't find Tom.
Try ringing him.
Shall I carry your bags?
I'm good, thank you.
I'll be fine.
Again?
Tom!
Where are you?
I'm here!
But where is here?
Will you be eating in?
No, I'll have it takeaway.
I never thought Tom would win.
Me neither.
Ahhhh!
What's with you all a sudden?
Something fell.
So, are you really dating Tom?
What?
Who'd you hear that from?
I just couldn't be bothered.
Is this clock on time?
It gets set automatically.
Have you been here before?
Nah, this is my first time.
What's this shop?
OK.
It's alright!
It's all right!
Done, agreed
I can't breathe!
They didn't have enough money
You threw salt?
She's going to drink some milk
Why are you afraid of Derek?
It's raining today
It's hard to be a woman
I can't run as fast
You're just afraid of Buddhism
It's from fear
Luck doesn't exist
Is there any doctor among us?
I shouldn't go - I want to go
I don't know either
But everybody has it.
Don't peek
They're not going to catch us
Have you been here before?
No, It's my first time.
No, It's my first time here.
Where did you put my book?
In a way, you were right
I didn't wake up yesterday
Fido, do you want a treat?
I love you, Fido
Are you going to town today?
I'm glad you came over
I'm really sorry about Tom
We're about the same height
Where's Tom?
He's got a date.
Does your mom know?
I'll call you tonight
Tom, watch your mouth!
Why did she lie about her age?
Is he really that clueless?
I'll show you how it works
Are you sure you aren't cold?
Are you sure you're not cold?
Who farted?
Debussy.
Definitely not Tom.
I was born with it!
It definitely won't be Tom.
Why are you so cool?
I was born this way.
Where did the horse go?
What is today?
What is this year?
This year is 2015
Tom isn't good at driving
I can't believe anyone anymore
I'm happy to know she's well
This isn't a new car
Long live the Tatoeba Project!
While I run, I stumble
What time are we meeting?
Where are we meeting?
Does it sound familiar?
Is it okay with you?
Is that okay with you?
Do you understand Tatar?
Is there a good time to chat?
Did I catch you at a bad time?
I'm not sure about the date
Who am I to say?
Don't overthink it
It's about time!
Do you feel well?
Do you feel seedy?
Do you have an interpreter?
Your mother is very beautiful!
It's my birthday today
I'm already eighteen
Where are you from, sir?
Japan.
How much is it?
Ten dollars, I think.
Is she dating someone?
Damn it!
I forgot my password!
I forgot my password!
Why are you doing this?
Why not?
That's awesome!
You think so?
Am I useless?
They were dancing a lot!
Whoa!
I'm going to be a father!
Tom's wife is hard-working
Happy christening!
He won’t expect it back
I'm not saying it's aliens
But it's aliens
I don't speak Esperanto well
Why did you do that?
Do what?
You're not going to win
When is Halloween?
I'm being perfectly honest
She's such a loser
We're getting married Friday.
What?
Do you have my key yet?
Now I’ll have to kill you
Please don't kill me!
Deep-fried food is delicious
That's a cute costume
Can we come, too?
What'll you drink?
Do you still have my key?
Where's the mistake?
You're told to go
Where's your bedroom?
What's my room number?
You don't need to drive him
Tom doesn't have to impress me
Tom didn't have to shout
We could've heard him anyway
Tom didn't have to come here
He could've just called
Did I hear you correctly?
Are you saying you disagree?
Tom didn't have to speak
Tom isn't really sick
He's just pretending to be
You'd better hurry
If you don't, you'll be late
Tom can't do that right now
He's really busy
Tom doesn't need to tell me
Tom can't do it alone
Don't let Tom drive
He's been drinking
Tom can't be hungry
Don't be so hard on Tom
Do you speak French?
Not very well.
Tom doesn't know what this is
Do you?
Don't give it to Tom
Do you speak French?
No, I don't.
How much do you want to bet?
You shouldn't have backed down
Yes, of course, you're correct
We're not concerned about that
We're deeply concerned by that
We haven't yet closed the deal
We couldn't help being friends
Tom's new house is really nice
Tom's guess is as good as mine
Tom's flight has been canceled
Tom's books have sold millions
Tom wouldn't go into specifics
Tom won't return until evening
Tom will keep his word, I hope
Tom should've said "thank you.
Tom says he needs a break, too
Tom said he didn't have a plan
Tom isn't welcome here anymore
Tom doesn't want us to do that
Tom doesn't seem too surprised
Tom doesn't seem too convinced
Tom doesn't seem all that busy
Tom doesn't need to work today
Tom doesn't need my permission
Tom doesn't look all that busy
Tom doesn't know what you want
Tom doesn't know how bad it is
Tom doesn't know all the facts
Tom doesn't have to do it here
Tom doesn't have to believe me
Tom doesn't have all the facts
Tom doesn't have a temperature
Tom doesn't have a lot of time
Tom doesn't have a good memory
Tom doesn't get paid very much
Tom didn't understand anything
Tom didn't seem very surprised
Tom didn't seem very satisfied
Tom didn't seem very impressed
Tom didn't seem to want to win
Tom didn't need any convincing
Tom didn't look all that happy
Tom didn't know how bad it was
Tom didn't know Mary very well
Tom didn't have to wait for me
Tom didn't have to do it alone
Tom didn't have to do anything
Tom didn't have to come see me
Tom didn't get paid last month
Tom didn't even try to help me
Tom didn't attend the ceremony
Tom didn't attend that meeting
Tom did it on purpose, I think
Tom couldn't get his shoes off
Tom couldn't finish his dinner
Tom could've told me the truth
Tom could've ruined everything
Tom can't stay here any longer
Tom became our manager in 2013
Tom acted as if he didn't care
Things couldn't get any better
That's what caused our problem
That's going to cause problems
That's another concern of mine
That information isn't correct
Nothing's ever going to change
Let's try to change the system
It's such a unique combination
It's hard to speak French well
It's definitely very confusing
It wasn't me who told Tom that
I've been coaching three years
I'm very, very, very concerned
I'm sure that Tom can fix this
I'm sad for everyone concerned
I'm going to go there with Tom
I'm going to call Tom tomorrow
I'm a retired flight attendant
I won't tell anyone about this
I don't get up as early as Tom
I don't care how much it costs
I couldn't survive without Tom
I couldn't get it done on time
I could've done that by myself
I certainly don't condone that
I can't believe we got invited
Don't let Tom watch that movie
Don't let Tom lie on the floor
Don't let Tom do it by himself
Don't let Tom answer the phone
Don't give Tom my phone number
Don't forget your bathing suit
Don't count on Tom to help you
Don't be afraid to talk to Tom
Boxing isn't like other sports
You could've resuscitated Tom
Will people actually buy this?
Why would you need to do that?
Why would anyone be surprised?
Why would Tom want me to help?
Why would Tom need to do that?
Why don't you ask Tom to help?
Why couldn't someone help Tom?
Why are you reading that book?
Who could complain about that?
Who are you leaving in charge?
Which one would you recommend?
What's been keeping you awake?
What else are you considering?
What could be more worthwhile?
What could I have done better?
What changes should we expect?
What Chinese food do you like?
We're still a little confused
We're concerned about it, too
We're aware of the challenges
We'll continue to support Tom
We'll continue to be vigilant
Tom's hypothesis is plausible
Tom's family owns this bakery
Tom's condition isn't serious
Tom's birthday is coming soon
Tom's advice has been helpful
Tom would've loved this movie
Tom would've liked to be here
Tom won't get home until 2:30
Tom won't be allowed to leave
Tom wasn't wearing a name tag
Tom said you'd gone to Boston
Tom said he doesn't want this
Tom isn't like the rest of us
Tom isn't afraid of me, is he?
Tom is going to need one, too
Tom is enjoying this, I think
Tom dyes his hair, doesn't he?
Tom doesn't talk much anymore
Tom doesn't seem very pleased
Tom doesn't seem to be hungry
Tom doesn't seem to be afraid
Tom doesn't seem so old to me
Tom doesn't say much, does he?
Tom doesn't really trust Mary
Tom doesn't know where I went
Tom doesn't know us very well
Tom doesn't know me very well
Tom doesn't keep his promises
Tom doesn't have any freckles
Tom didn't want to go with us
Tom didn't seem too surprised
Tom didn't seem afraid at all
Tom didn't say anything wrong
Tom didn't look too surprised
Tom didn't look all that busy
Tom didn't know all the facts
Tom didn't have any more time
Tom didn't have all the facts
Tom didn't have a lot of time
Tom didn't do enough research
Tom didn't call me last night
Tom couldn't solve the puzzle
Tom couldn't keep his balance
Tom couldn't do it by himself
Tom committed suicide in 2013
Tom can't go with us tomorrow
Tom became the band's manager
Tom attended Monday's meeting
Tom and I don't usually agree
They're trying to control you
The wedding's been called off
That's not a valid comparison
That's not a good combination
That story can't be confirmed
That might happen to you, too
Nobody could've expected this
My parents don't speak French
Most people really don't care
More than 300 people attended
Let's drop in on the Jacksons
Kids don't read books anymore
It's unclear why Tom did that
It's time to begin downsizing
It's quite an unusual concept
It's not all that complicated
It's fun hanging out with you
It's fun hanging out with Tom
It's a very historic building
It's a really tough challenge
Is your French getting better?
Is there a direct correlation?
I've never tried Mexican food
I'm very concerned about this
I'm a very competitive person
I'll get Tom to buy us a cake
I'd love to go back to Boston
I'd be very happy to help you
I wouldn't celebrate just yet
I wasn't concerned about that
I think we could've done more
I hear you're studying French
I don't think Tom can hear us
I don't have health insurance
I don't believe it's possible
I couldn't sleep on the plane
I couldn't move my right foot
I couldn't help with anything
I bet you've done this before
How often do you study French?
How much money would you need?
How did your friendship begin?
Have you met Tom's girlfriend?
Have you hugged anyone lately?
Everybody else is coming, too
Don't let anyone move my desk
Don't let Tom jump on the bed
Don't let anyone sit here
Do you seriously believe that?
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
Did that really happen to Tom?
Could you please do something?
Could you do anything to help?
Are you ready for a challenge?
A smile doesn't cost anything
I agree with Tom.
So do I.
You're welcome to come along
You're almost as tall as Tom
You're a lot taller than Tom
You couldn't be more correct
Would you have believed that?
Would tonight be soon enough?
Would that make a difference?
Would someone please help me?
Why would we need to do that?
Why does Tom need to do that?
Why are you moving to Boston?
Who are we competing against?
Where else could that happen?
Where can I buy one of those?
When did you buy this bicycle?
What's this called in French?
What would be the difference?
What caused the power outage?
What brings you here tonight?
We're facing a budget crisis
We can't ignore this anymore
We can't control the weather
Tom's pupils became dilated
Tom's closest friend is Mary
Tom said he'd be coming back
Tom said he wasn't concerned
Tom likes Boston, doesn't he?
Tom is exaggerating, I think
Tom is Mary's closest friend
Tom hasn't paid for that yet
Tom doesn't think he'll lose
Tom doesn't think he can win
Tom doesn't really love Mary
Tom doesn't need to thank us
Tom doesn't need to thank me
Tom doesn't need to know why
Tom doesn't need to go there
Tom doesn't need to be there
Tom doesn't know where it is
Tom doesn't know what I know
Tom doesn't have to thank us
Tom doesn't have to thank me
Tom doesn't have to go there
Tom doesn't have to eat this
Tom didn't understand at all
Tom didn't seem very pleased
Tom didn't seem to be hungry
Tom didn't know what this is
Tom didn't hear that from me
Tom didn't have to apologize
Tom didn't have a lot to say
Tom couldn't handle the pain
Tom couldn't handle that job
Tom couldn't be here tonight
Tom could've killed somebody
Tom could've gone by himself
Tom and John aren't brothers
Tom and I don't always agree
Things won't change too much
The changes won't be radical
That's my conclusion as well
That's how we became friends
That would be awesome, right?
Maybe I'll call you sometime
Let's wait till Tom wakes up
Let's not go if it's raining
Let's get this party rolling
It's unclear what went wrong
It's time for a coffee break
It's really tough to compare
It's not too late to do that
It's not a difficult concept
It's a public safety concern
It's a pretty simple concept
It couldn't have been better
Is Tom even paying attention?
I've always hated that color
I'm starting to learn French
I'm starting to believe that
I'm pretty sure Tom can swim
I'm glad you didn't get hurt
I'm contemplating doing that
I'll think it over carefully
I shouldn't have backed down
I really, truly believe that
I really couldn't believe it
I don't care about the price
I couldn't pass up that deal
I couldn't hear myself think
I couldn't have been happier
I could sense Tom's presence
I can't change what happened
I almost couldn't believe it
How were the bombs detonated?
Has Tom cleaned his room yet?
Don't speak to Tom like that
Don't let Tom use my bicycle
Don't depend on Tom too much
Don't ask Tom for any favors
Does the color really matter?
Do you speak French fluently?
Could you send me some money?
Could you see that happening?
Could Tom have been murdered?
You'd better not get caught
Would you please just leave?
Would you like more details?
Will anything really change?
Why would that surprise you?
Why won't anyone believe me?
Why don't people believe me?
Why do you suspect sabotage?
Why are you looking for Tom?
Who could've predicted this?
Who cares whose fault it is?
Where did Tom meet his wife?
What would your solution be?
What made you change course?
What could be more romantic?
What brought the price down?
Well, that could be helpful
We're trying to change that
We're going to make changes
We won't be buying anything
We didn't go out last night
We didn't complain about it
We couldn't cross the river
We can't ask Tom to do that
Was it really coming closer?
Tom's hair was slicked back
Tom's flight leaves at 2:30
Tom's accusations are false
Tom would've been impressed
Tom won't like it in Boston
Tom won't be able to say no
Tom won't be able defeat me
Tom won't ask me to do that
Tom will be there, won't he?
Tom simply couldn't keep up
Tom says he's not concerned
Tom is avoiding me, I think
Tom doesn't need to do this
Tom doesn't need to do that
Tom doesn't need to call me
Tom doesn't need to be here
Tom doesn't need me anymore
Tom doesn't know who did it
Tom doesn't know what I did
Tom doesn't know the system
Tom doesn't have to help me
Tom doesn't have to be here
Tom doesn't have a name tag
Tom didn't take his hat off
Tom didn't need to buy this
Tom didn't miss the meeting
Tom didn't look comfortable
Tom didn't know what I knew
Tom didn't know Mary at all
Tom didn't have to thank us
Tom didn't have to thank me
Tom didn't have to say that
Tom didn't complain, did he?
Tom didn't attend the forum
Tom didn't attend the event
Tom couldn't talk very well
Tom couldn't have done more
Tom couldn't bear the truth
Tom could've been one of us
Tom could've asked me first
Tom can't stay here anymore
Tom can't live here anymore
Tom can't handle this alone
Tom can't go anywhere today
Tom can't do that right now
This isn't likely to change
They're not going to change
They should've contacted us
They could've gone anywhere
There's reason to celebrate
There's blood on your hands
There's blood on this knife
The noise didn't bother Tom
That's none of your concern
That's how we usually do it
That's how I was brought up
That's been made very clear
That's basically why I came
That's always a big concern
That's all they cared about
That'll bring the cost down
That woman's very beautiful
That couldn't be more wrong
That budget isn't yet final
Now you're bringing me down
Let's think outside the box
Let's go visit the Jacksons
Let's bring our troops home
It's already out of control
It must've been an accident
It couldn't have been worse
Is your blood pressure high?
Is it OK if I bring a guest?
Is Tom feeling better today?
I've never had a steady job
I'm ready for the challenge
I'm not concerned right now
I'm not angry at all of you
I'm hoping that'll continue
I'm going to miss competing
I'll still call Boston home
I wasn't the one who yelled
I think Tom didn't trust me
I know Tom doesn't love you
I just couldn't stop myself
I doubt that'll ever change
I don't have any complaints
I don't care about politics
I don't believe you anymore
I didn't know Tom back then
I couldn't even feed myself
I couldn't do anything else
I could've done that better
I can't believe it happened
How will you be celebrating?
How could anyone think that?
Has anything really changed?
Don't tell Tom where I live
Don't pay attention to them
Don't let Tom use the phone
Do you want to learn French?
Do you think they'd hire me?
Do you think Tom would wait?
Do you think Tom would help?
Do you share those concerns?
Do you believe these rumors?
Do you believe in astrology?
Did you see Tom in the park?
Could there be a connection?
Could Tom have changed this?
Come on, we're running late
Come on, we're almost there
Can you speak French at all?

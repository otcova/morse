Shouldn't we leave?
Shouldn't we try to help?
Shouldn't you be in bed?
Shut up, will you?
Slow down, will you?
So, what are we going to do?
So, what do you think of it?
So, what do you think?
So, will you go out with me?
Some of you won't make it
Somebody's going to pay
Somebody's got to do it
Somebody's got to do something
Someday, we'll know
Somehow, Tom knew
Someone's been here recently
Soon, we'll know why
Stay out of this, Tom
Take over, will you?
Tell Tom I'll do it
That isn't going to happen
That isn't going to help
That was Tom's choice
That was Tom's cousin
That wasn't one of the choices
That wasn't so bad
That wasn't so hard, was it?
That wasn't there before
That wasn't there this morning
That would be illegal, right?
That would've been awesome
That would've been awful
That would've been hilarious
That would've been nice
That would've been smart
That wouldn't be appropriate
That wouldn't be good
That wouldn't be practical
That wouldn't be wise
That'll be difficult
That'll take some time
That's a very interesting one
That's all I'll say
That's all in the past
That's all it takes sometimes
That's all that happened
That's all that matters
That's all there is to it
That's all there is
That's all there was to it
That's all there was
That's all Tom had to do
That's all Tom has to say
That's all Tom needed
That's all Tom said
That's all Tom wanted
That's all Tom wants
That's all we can ask
That's all we do here
That's all we know about Tom
That's all we're offering
That's all you can do
That's all you have to do
That's exactly what I need
That's exactly what Tom needs
That's exactly what we need
That's going to be difficult
That's going to be tough
That's going to take forever
That's going to take time
That's got to be painful
That's got to be uncomfortable
That's not going to be easy
That's not going to be enough
That's not going to be fun
That's not going to work
That's not so bad
That's not so good
That's not so long
That's not so many
That's not what it means
That's not what that means
That's not what that was
That's not what they're after
That's not what this is about
That's not what we did
That's one of mine
That's one of my concerns
That's one of my favorites
That's one of our rules
That's one of ours
That's one of the reasons
That's one of them
That's the best one
That's the going rate
That's the last one
That's the one we want
That's up to Tom
That's up to you
That's what I need
That's what I'll do
That's what I've been avoiding
That's what I've been doing
That's what I've been saying
That's what I've ordered
That's what matters, right?
That's what Tom was hiding
That's what we all thought
That's what we do best
That's what we do here
That's what we have to discuss
That's what we need to do
That's what we need
That's what we think
That's what we want, isn't it?
That's what we were thinking
That's what we're hoping
That's what will happen
That's what you all say
That's what you do best
That's what you promised
That's what you said yesterday
That's what you would think
That's what's going on
The cat's out of the bag
The game's about to begin
The meeting's about to start
The pleasure's all mine
The world's gone crazy
There isn't time for that
There isn't time to do that
There isn't time to explain
There's been some trouble
There's going to be a storm
There's got to be an answer
There's only room for one
There's somebody in there
There's somebody out there
There's someone in there
There's someone out there
There's someone up there
There's something going around
There's something in there
There's something on your back
There's something on your neck
They don't have one
They'll never reach us in time
They're not going to stop
They're the perfect family
They've been there for a while
Think about it, OK?
This is all Tom's fault
This is so weird, isn't it?
This is what we're up against
This isn't about me
This isn't about that
This isn't about them
This isn't about Tom
This isn't getting us anywhere
This isn't going to be easy
This isn't going to be good
This isn't what Tom expected
This isn't what we planned
This one is Tom's
This one wasn't your mistake
This was in Tom's safe
Tom knows how much it'll cost
Tom knows what it's about
Tom, can you take over?
Tom's prints were on the gun
Tonight's going to be fun
Tonight's going to be perfect
Wait a minute, will you?
Was that so bad?
Was that so hard?
Was there a fight?
Was there a fire?
Was there a malfunction?
Was there a note?
Was there a reason?
Was there a scandal?
Was there a time limit?
Was there an earthquake?
Was there an investigation?
Was Tom a nurse?
Was Tom an addict?
Was Tom on drugs?
Was Tom with you?
We can't all be perfect
We'll all be together
We'll protect each other
We're in the middle of nowhere
We're not exactly sure
We're not going in there
We're perfect for each other
We've always protected you
We've met once before
Well, what are we going to do?
Were you intoxicated?
Were you one of them?
Were you thinking about me?

You're a very lovely woman
You're exactly right, Tom
You're going to be a father
You're going to be fine
You're going to be seen
You're no doubt confused, Tom
You're not rich, are you?
You're perfect for the job
At least I'm older than you
No cannons, no oil
Let's all go to Luna Park
You're better off without her
That's the way it goes
You're talking rot
Don't make me repeat myself
I'd like to work at a hospital
You'll do it yourself
Are you a teacher?
Happy Qurban!
You as well, thank you.
Don't go praising yourself
Hi, Harry!
Tom..
Tom Riddle!
Ha, no!
What?
I am you!
Are you a ghost?
No, I'm a cook!
What?
A key to a woman's heart?
What are you on about?
Get up, Ronald!
He's a biologist
I'm playing with the computer
I'm playing with a computer
He won't pass the test
She won't pass the test
I don't know how healthy it is
Which languages do you speak?
I'm afraid of injections
How could you do that to me?
Do you think they suspect me?
When did you go to sleep?
She's on the verge of dying
Get up, Ronald!
The key to a woman's heart?
What are you on about?
You should just do her!
Finally one useful suggestion!
Search harder on Google!
He hasn't got a lot to give
She hasn't got a lot to give
I'm drinking a beer
It's a minute to three o'clock
Can I get some clean towels?
I'm a rich man
Send a telegram!
Who are my new neighbors?
That's not my finger!
Do all of you speak Chinese?
What is his daily goal?
We'll make it together!
They're tasting the rice
Where is the librarian?
Is that your goal?
I wasn't quite sure about that
Do seedless watermelons exist?
Nigger" is an offensive word
Negro" is an offensive word
How is the research going?
Reasonably well.
They didn't like the film
They didn't like the movie
Show me the photographs!
Show me the pictures!
Show me the photos!
If it's possible, why not?
Give me that book back!
You don't speak English
You all don't speak English
That's a faster way
Now it's four days to Saturday
Coward!
Never speak to me again!
I'm selling my car
I'm starting to learn German
Where's the Polish embassy?
I'm at home right now
Is this your money?
Don't believe him
Yes, I think so too
Tom's hesitating
May I come right over?
So let's go ahead
You shouldn't eat it now
He's not a patch on him
Will she be back home at five?
Who broke the window?
That'll cost thirty euros
Do you need some advice?
I'll stay until evening
Are you over 18?
It's easier than you think
It's harder than you think
Why are you bleeding?
How old was he?
How old was she?
You're prettier than her

There's no shame in that
I'm glad she's okay
I'm glad he's okay
Could you get me some milk?
Can you get me some milk?
I'm going to kick your ass!
It's not like the movies
It's almost midnight
I'll pay for you
It's smaller than in Tokyo
Come even if you'll be late
Be quiet and go to your room!
I'm not teaching you English
Where's the kitchen?
You'll find everything
It's a roasted egg
What should I do about this?
This isn't about you
The grown-ups know
It's a matter of when, not if
Please tell me it's a joke
You're talking out of your ass
I'm just glad you're safe
There's no money
It's actually very easy to do
There's no job without benefit
My car is alcohol-powered
Did you find a job?
Is this an actor?
I don't know what you will do
That's real love!
I didn't say this
We're right behind you
You know you can't do that
Are you going to vote for me?
You're not going anywhere
Were you feeling resistance?
How can that be?
There's no reason to worry
Did you forget to greet me?
What am I being accused of?
Nooo!
Tom!
Noo!
May I speak with him?
Are we good to go?
Beat him with the broom!
I want to die on that night!
What are you doing?
I'm watching my plants grow.
What did he say?
What did she say?
What did he say?
He said yes.
What did she say?
She said yes.
You're acting strange tonight
Where did you get the recipe?
I'm not here to make friends
Is this the best you can do?
Such thing can't be true
This won't end well
Hello, son
I trust you're healing well
Lamp oil?
Rope?
Bombs?
You want it?
It's all total nonsense
I'm responsible for that
You should stay here till 2:30
What's necessary?
You got that right!
I came here to tell you.
Me?
Can he play the guitar?
Got all that?
Where's my dinner?
I didn't say this!
Do I have a fever?
Unfortunately, I forgot it
Ah, bummer!
Would you look at that!
I'll go to school
What have you done to them?
I'm going to the United States
This is my opinion, not yours
Why did you leave like that?
There's a guy in my yoga class
I'm not angry at you
Ooh!
Can I make a suggestion?
I hope you know that, Tom
Are you okay?
Tell me what's wrong
Men have Adam's apples
Do you go in for sports?

You're the same age as my son
Oh my God, you too???
I can't wait to see her
I can't wait to see him
Can anyone hear me?
Are you accusing me?
Are you accusing Tom?
Don't be shy
What is he trying to hide?
What is she trying to hide?
I don't believe a word of it
Esperanto!
Do you love each other deeply?
How deep is your love?
May I invite you to a chat?
Nothing blew up!
He's never drunk any wine
We haven't talked in years
I'm your girlfriend
She's not my friend
Why are people so cruel?
I didn't mean any harm by it
It's a cruel world out there
What is your biggest weakness?
Can I have it back?
Can I have it back?
No.
You're so beautiful
What's your name?
Mind your own business.
I've got a white horse
I'm not interested
And don't come back
Sorry, I'm not interested
I'd love to, but I'm busy
I said: "I'm not interested.
I'm not here to look cute
Are you in?
I'll go tomorrow
When will you be back home?
I don't like the bad boy
I'm waiting for the right man
Can I go first?
I'm paid fortnightly
We'll see each other again
You're made for each other
They're made for each other
I guess I'd better get going!
I'm an archaeologist
Today's March 27th
I'm involved with someone
He's a charming man
Are you feeling tired?
Why do bad things happen?
They're all the same!
Come on, Styopa!
Yeah say that again!
Yes, you're right
I know!
Where's my money?
What money?
You owe me money.
I don't owe you, sucker!
Hey, you!
Yes?
See this piece of shit here?
Yes.
Do I owe him money?
Yes!" "...Screw you!
Yes...
You will find money.
Or else what?
I will seize your house!
Shit!
Ahahahaha!
Why?
Everybody wants that, dear
It doesn't exist.
Paris wasn't built in a day
Shame on you, Styopa!
Styopa, how clever you are!
Well done!
You've been expelled
So what then?
Nothing.
It's clear that he's at home
Has he broken up with you?
Don't be so backboneless!
He's better than us all
I've bought some clothes
It's too late now, Lusya!
The train has left, Lusya!
Are you afraid of heights?
You'd better say nothing!
Let's go at around five
Emet's about fifty now
It's about seven thirty
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I can't get my car started.
What's wrong?
My computer just crashed.

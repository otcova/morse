That's not sure
Tubular, man!
Do you live near here?
Do you live around here?
It's too early to leave
Don't ever underestimate Tom
What do you think?
Did she quote a price for it?
Vote for me!
It's awfully bitter
I can't go with you
What do I owe?
Don't touch the blue switch!
I'm reading a letter
I'm here to win
Are you still mad at me?
No, not at all.
Are you going to tell him?
Are you going to tell her?
My boyfriend doesn't love me
Want one?
He's older than me
Who gave them to me?
How are you doing there?
I think I've understood
I'll never return
I'll never be back
It's for you that I came
That airplane is huge!
Where's she from?
What would you like to buy?
I'll follow your instructions
I love Titanic!
Is that what Tom wanted?
They didn't get anything done
We'll all wait for you
Tom said he'd wait for us
Get your hair cut!
It's awfully expensive
It's terribly expensive
Not now, honey
What more could a girl want?
What more could a man want?
What more could a woman want?
Does this window open?
I want milk and cookies!
I don't know
He didn't look pleased
She didn't look pleased
What did she say?
I don't remember.
What did he say?
I don't remember.
We're heading for the beach
The beach isn't far from here
How was the beach?
How about a walk on the beach?
Did you grow up near a beach?
Why is fish so expensive?
Who are you insured with?
They both don't like me
She's sweet and innocent
Can you decipher the message?
Can you decode the message?
She didn't deserve to die
He didn't deserve to die
She didn't clean the dishes
I don't think she cared
I don't think she cares
I don't think he cared
I don't think he cares
I'm really here on business
Every year it's the same story
Who's that little kid?
Why?
I don't understand English
I can't read you this book
Where is your language spoken?
Is your language endangered?
What's in your suitcase?
It's up to 5·10-³ meters
Is it a threat?
Getting busted isn't fun
Close your windows!
There is something in the fog!
I'm sure you despise me
What are your conclusions?
What company do you represent?
What's it composed of?
When did Tom come to town?
Tom isn't used to city life
Can plants feel pain?
She's bipolar
She's very polite
He's very polite
I'm not very polite
He's rich, but obnoxious
He's rich, but unfriendly
Why am I watching this?
You are mine!
Tom's house burned down
The dog couldn't bark
I can't hit her back
She's a woman
I called Lida "la india
What do you believe now?
You're right
I'll go by taxi
He's kind of shy
She's kind of shy
I don't interest your names
Would you come our house?
OK, we've got a deal
He isn't my manager
I can't retrieve the paper
I don't want to read any paper
That's what it looks like
She doesn't look like her mom
Is this some kind of trick?
Have you been crying?
I know I'm not to blame
Where are the plants?
My plants are dying!
He's an agronomist
It's a really good book
What do you think of the book?
Did he ask you about me?
She's a tarot reader
The song is well-known to all
I'm staying home today
He's what?
She's what?
It's what?
Tom's apartment is cluttered
You went too far!
He's an attractive guy
I'm sure we'll get along
He didn't mean it
I didn't mean to
I'm sure that I'm right
Dibs I go first!
Bags I go first!
It's unbelievably beautiful!
Do we need to comment?
It would make them rich!
Which factory was it?
He's never hunted
I'm tickled pink to be here
Does anyone of you know Tom?
Have you counted the towels?
What country were you born in?
Is Tom an American too?
Do any of you know Tom?
Have any of you ever met Tom?
I don't want to study today
You're a handsome man, indeed
Would you like some tea?
Yes, please.
Is Tom also studying French?
I've hit the lottery
I've hit the jackpot
Do you understand Chinese?
How did you know about that?
Do you have a soup bowl?
Do you have any soup bowls?
What's the correct answer?
I'm fortunate compared to him
My flight arrived at 9 pm
Let's go and sit in the shade
Let's go sit in the shade
Let's sit in the shade
Are you covered by insurance?
Nothing will happen until 2:30
Are you as excited as we are?
It's time to get moving!
It's time to wake up!
It's time to wake up now
Tom, wake up!
It's time to wake up, dear
Where am I?
What happened?
Why didn't you wake me up?
Why did you wake me up?
They walked side-by-side
How fast he swims!
You've got another MILF?
What happened to the last one?
What's the meaning of MILF?
I'm going to bed, bye
I'm going to bed
Can you tell us about it?
Can you tell me about it?
Were you spying on me?
Did you tell Tom about it?
Did you tell Tom about Mary?
Did Tom tell Mary what to do?
Don't leave a trace
I can't trust him anymore
You did a very fine job!
I take my hat off to you!
Hold your tongue!
I'll never come back
Where have I read it before?
What happened?
This just cannot be!
I can't do this to him
I can't do this to her
No, it's not right
Can I get your number?
I couldn't find my sandwich
I couldn't finish my sandwich
You will eat your sandwich!
Whether you like it or not!
I'd like a sandwich
I don't want a sandwich
I'd like a sandwich, please
Go on, please
What were you looking at?
What were you staring at?
I didn't kill anybody!
Won't you tell me?
What are you talking about?
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
You're fired!
Tom, you're fired!
The bed is on fire!
That's not fair!
Tom, what were you looking at?
I'm not fat!
The older, the wiser
Tom lost 30 kilograms
It'll take a long time
Where is Laurie?
Where is the hotel?
I'll take my hat off to you
Is this for sale?
Are these for sale?
I'll go to bed early
I'll learn German
I'm not Darth Vader
I don't have anything to do!
Is she beautiful?
Do you have the book?
They're getting worse
Spaghetti don't grow on trees
Can I cash this cheque?
Live and fight!
Shall we go to Lithuania?
That's my line
That's what I want to ask
You'll stay in Síle's house
Siobhán will do her homework
Breandán is a lawyer
I'm Máire's fiancé
Don't you hate everything?
It's quite simple
This is Tom's room
Can we talk this over?
Can't we just talk this over?
Don't you think it's cool?
Does he have a big family?
Does he have a big nose?
Does he have long hair?
Does he have gray hair?
Does he have a big house?
Is this bad for my hair?
How is it possible?
He's a good kisser
He won't live long
I can't believe I cried
She has long, curly hair
You don't have any freckles
She doesn't have any freckles
I'll sleep on the couch
What's your sign?
I won't find a girlfriend
Catch it!
Europe doesn't need anyone
Let's wait for our turn
Where is Banja Luka?
Where is the dog?
This is my father's shirt
This is my mother's computer
Tomorrow I'll turn 28
Where can I leave my bike?
Where can I leave my bicycle?
The plane takes off at 17:30
What does he look like?
He says you're lying
She says you're lying
Are you sure it was Tom?
Are you sure it was me?
I couldn't help blushing
Let's start with the basics
Do you have a deck of cards?
How much damage has been done?
Is the wound very deep?
It's been a long day
It's dangerous to swim here
Let's cut the cake now
Let's go up on deck
May I have the next dance?
This is a dead-end street
Tom's father is dead
We're in danger of being late
Whatever you say, dear
Who's your date tonight?
Catch me!
I wish you'd both keep quiet
Did the dog bark?
Do not worry about it!
I really need some tequila!
There's a doghouse in the yard
My spoon is bigger!
From where do you see that?
I'm not exporting your clothes
I'm not filtering your tea
I'm not straining your tea
I'm not closing off your rooms
I'm not cracking your mugs
I don't crack your mugs
It's a miracle
That's his horse
I'll be ready in two minutes
Don't talk
I'm on the interstate
Mary, you're beautiful
Is Tom an artist?
Oh, thank you, Tom
Thank you!
Wake up, sleepy-head!
The door wasn't closed
I'm really shocked
She is alive!
She's alive!
Tom is alive!
I'm sorry, my love
He's from Germany
He isn't much older than me
She's not much younger than me
I'll give you one more chance
He's not breathing!
It's hard to imagine
She's a fan of German cinema
She's a fan of French cinema
I'll give you one last chance
I won't always be around
He won't always be around
She won't always be around
She's extremely cautious
How fast were you going?
Does he speak with an accent?
This is so much better!
You won't like him
I hope you don't die
I hope she doesn't die
I hope he doesn't die
This isn't going to work
I haven't finished my lunch
Let us know in the comments!
He has occult powers!
She has occult powers!
He has otherwordly powers!
She has otherwordly powers!
He has preternatural powers!
She has preternatural powers!
I'm coming back home by bus
You'll lose time
She'll lose time
He'll lose time
Don't let the fire die down
They're always deep in debt
This isn't a diamond
It's just plain glass
This mine is 500 meters deep
Tom died this morning at 2:30
What did I tell you to do?
He's not bad
She's not bad
I knew he didn't like me
I know he doesn't like me
I knew she didn't like me
I know she doesn't like me
Is it good or not?
You have to try!
They're towing your car
You have to eat everything!
Clean your plate!
Eat!
Do you miss your friends?
It's not blood
It's tomato sauce
He's tall and athletic
He's a sore loser
Don't let the fire burn out
How handsome you are!
Today I'm all out of ideas
It's sad
I can't stop smoking
I can't leave off smoking
She's a good-looking woman
He's a good-looking man
He's good looking for his age
She's good-looking for her age
The restaurant wasn't full
It wasn't all that great
Stop being so ridiculous!
Can I drive you home later?
I'm working too much
I'd like some ice cream
He's a Frenchman
I'm your older sister
I'm your elder sister
That's what makes me happy
I'll change the sheets
Have we met somewhere before?
That's my car!
Are all laws just?
How many legs does a dog have?
Is this water safe to drink?
Why can't Tom come?
I'll loan you my dictionary
That was so cute!
What a jungle!
It's hard to say
I'll meet you downstairs
Did you hear about the rumor?
She didn't believe the rumor
He didn't believe the rumor
He doesn't eat meat, does he?
I didn't want to go with you
I don't want to put it down
What did I just watch?
The T-shirt costs ten euro
I hope she's okay
She doesn't look happy
But why do they do it?
But why did they do it?
But why did you do it?
But why did he do it?
But why did she do it?
Mom, there is nothing to eat
I'm going to Nîmes tomorrow
Where is Nîmes?
No action today, is there?
Which car is yours?
Which car is theirs?
We all saw it!
We all saw him!
He's got wood
Good job, my friend!
Do you have mobile phones?
Tom wasn't jealous
The brakes didn't work
So there is a problem..
But there's a problem
We're only friends?
We're just friends?
Are we only friends?
John's older than I thought
He's doing well
Enjoy the fucking music!
That's the only way to do it
Who's hungry?
Who is hungry?
You should write a book!
Where's that?
He's drunk
How's the hematoma, Tom?
We're in summer, not in winter
Quit finding fault with me!
He always finds fault with me!
I'm in Paris
She doesn't like this game
She didn't like this game
What to do when you're tired?
How old is your grandmother?
I didn't order this
I'm sorry
I didn't do it on purpose
I am nobody's enemy
Don't push
I'm suffocating
The giant awoke!
Tom woke up at 6:30
Tom got up at 7:00
What is the weather in Athens?
How come you didn't come?
This is clearly Emet!
It's such a small thing
Oh, I got it
Caution!
How far?
What is 'terpomo'?
Let's play tag
Why isn't he coming out?
Don't know
Something's keeping him there.
Tom's a volunteer
We're looking for a volunteer
I was hoping you'd volunteer
It's summer already
Let us know if you're coming
I think it's wrong to lie
It's wrong to lie
How could I hate Tom?
Why didn't he say anything?
Who knows..
He just didn't.
What else is needed?
What a waste of time!
What else do I need to do?
Is your mother fine?
He's fine
I hope that doesn't happen
No, thank you
I don't drink coffee
She's a very beautiful girl
She didn't reply to my letter
You think too much!
It's free and fast!
It's of my liking
What have you been up to?
What a disappointment you are!
You're thinking too much
What's that in your hand?
What did the professor say?
Careful!
He's a man who we all respect
Do you know what you are?
Trash!
Is this a stallion or a mare?
How much sugar do we need?
How many eggs do we need?
How much paper do we need?
How much money do we need?
How many bees live in a hive?
I'll go to Greece
He's busy
Don't criticize him in public
Maybe you could draw me a map?
I won't ever have a daughter
Would you like to go with me?
Could you please be quiet?
He said he'd turn up the heat
I'm going to get myself a beer
Do you want one, too?
Can you wait?
I don't know
Don't let it get cold
I'm trying to study
Could you please be quiet?
I'm going to be rich
I'm still eating dinner
I'll call you back
You're all dressed up
Where are you going?
You've been very quiet
What's the matter?
Don't shoot
I'm one of the good guys
I'm sorry
It'll never happen again
It's my problem
I'll deal with it
This isn't a violin
It's a viola
Tom would've loved the concert
Tom would've been proud of you
I'm going to turn in
I think I might've found a job
I'm just feeling a little sick
I'm exhausted
I'm going to bed
You've said very little so far
You've got to take me with you
You've been in Boston too long
You're very good with children
You're shivering
Are you cold?
You're not in any trouble, Tom
You're not getting any younger
You're a good influence on Tom
You're a better person than me
You'll wish you'd gone with us
You won't believe what I heard
You won't believe what I found
You should've stayed in Boston
You don't have to wait in line
We're very sorry for your loss
We're not here to buy anything
We're not doing anything wrong
We're having a meeting at 2:30
We wouldn't ask you to do that
We should've gotten up earlier
Tom wouldn't accept my apology
Tom would've tried to stop you
Tom won't let you in his house
Tom won't come out of his room
Tom won't be showing up at all
Tom watched the 6 o'clock news
Tom said Mary wasn't his type
Tom said he'd consider my idea
Tom left his apartment at 2:30
Tom isn't ready to be a father
Tom isn't much younger than me
Tom isn't in any of my classes
Tom isn't at home, but Mary is
Tom isn't asking any questions
Tom heard Mary's car drive off
Tom got straight A's in school
Tom didn't want to leave early
Tom didn't use to be like that
Tom didn't know what was wrong
Tom didn't have anything to do
Tom didn't feel the earthquake
Tom can't wait until next week
They wouldn't refund my ticket
The food didn't taste that bad
The book fit into Tom's pocket
Someone's on the phone for you
Let's wrap this up and go home
It's good to be back in Boston
I've told Tom where to meet us
I've seen how badly Tom dances
I've got to go to the bathroom
I've been kicked out of school
I've been hanging out with Tom
I'm watching the football game
I'm warning you not to do that
I'm waiting for an explanation
I'm using the hammer right now
I'm thinking of writing a book
I'm the only one you can trust
I'm the one who's going to die
I'm the one who's been lied to
I'm the one Tom wanted to meet
I'm taking Tom to the hospital
I'm taking the train to Boston
I'm surprised to see you again
I'm surprised to find you here
I'm surprised it was that easy
I'm sure you heard all of that
I'm sure you can figure it out
I'm sure we could arrange that
I'm sure Tom's answer is right
I'm sure Tom will be home soon
I'm sure Tom will be back soon
I'm sure Tom knows what to say
I'm sure Tom is very impressed
I'm sure Tom had a good reason
I'm sure Tom doesn't like Mary
I'm sure that wasn't Tom's dog
I'm sure I'll manage on my own
I'm sure I told you about that
I'm sure I can find everything
I'm sure glad that's over with
I'm sure everything will be OK
I'm supposed to be on duty now
I'm still working on my report
I'm still waiting for my money
I'm still the boss around here
I'm still going to talk to Tom
I'm still getting used to that
I'm starting to agree with you
I'm sorry, this isn't for sale
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
I'm sorry, but the answer's no
I'm sorry, but my answer is no
I'm sorry, but I can't do that
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you
I'm sorry I lied to you before
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner
I'm so much older than you are
I'm so glad you suggested this
I'm so glad I could be of help
I'm slightly worried about Tom
I'm seriously annoyed with Tom
I'm sending someone to get you
I'm seeing Tom again on Monday
I'm responsible for everything
I'm really sorry to bother you
I'm really sorry I doubted you
I'm pretty sure I can help Tom
I'm prepared for any situation
I'm pleased you still remember
I'm pleased to hear you say so
I'm only trying to protect you
I'm only trying to comfort you
I'm not your assistant anymore
I'm not worried about anything
I'm not throwing anything away
I'm not talking about you, Tom
I'm not talking about that now
I'm not taking my eyes off Tom
I'm not taking calls right now
I'm not surprised to hear that
I'm not sure why you came here
I'm not sure where Tom is from
I'm not sure I've got it right
I'm not sure I'll be much help
I'm not sure how that happened
I'm not sure anything happened
I'm not saying it's impossible
I'm not really that interested
I'm not ready for a change yet
I'm not particularly impressed
I'm not making you do anything
I'm not interested in politics
I'm not having second thoughts
I'm not having dinner with you
I'm not going to tell Tom that
I'm not going to take anything
I'm not going to show you this
I'm not going to let you do it
I'm not going to let it happen
I'm not going to eat that much
I'm not going to do it anymore
I'm not going to ask you again
I'm not feeling so good myself
I'm not dropping out of school
I'm not comfortable doing this
I'm not certain about anything
I'm not asking your permission
I'm not allowed to talk to you
I'm not a hundred percent sure
I'm never going to get married
I'm never going back to Boston
I'm meeting Tom in ten minutes
I'm leaving this in your hands
I'm kind of excited about this
I'm just trying to be thorough
I'm just telling you the truth
I'm just sitting here thinking
I'm just sitting here relaxing
I'm just an innocent bystander
I'm inclined to agree with Tom
I'm in the middle of something
I'm in the middle of a meeting
I'm in no position to help you
I'm in a little bit of trouble
I'm hoping we can be roommates
I'm hoping Tom doesn't show up
I'm having trouble standing up
I'm having the time of my life
I'm having a friend over today
I'm happy to be done with that
I'm going to wait here for Tom
I'm going to visit Tom in jail
I'm going to try something new
I'm going to take care of this
I'm going to see what I can do
I'm going to run a few errands
I'm going to put on some music
I'm going to make it up to you
I'm going to have to work late
I'm going to go to the airport
I'm going to go tell everybody
I'm going to go home right now
I'm going to go get cleaned up
I'm going to go find our seats
I'm going to go feed the ducks
I'm going to go back to Boston
I'm going to get ready for bed
I'm going to get married again
I'm going to do this by myself
I'm going to come back for you
I'm going to check on the kids
I'm going to check my messages
I'm going to change my clothes
I'm going to call you tomorrow
I'm going to call an ambulance
I'm going to be talking to Tom
I'm going to approve your plan
I'm glad you're feeling better
I'm glad you told me about Tom
I'm glad you changed your mind
I'm glad you accepted my offer
I'm glad we made some progress
I'm glad I don't have your job
I'm glad I could be of service
I'm glad everything worked out
I'm getting married in October
I'm finally where I want to be
I'm doing this in spite of you
I'm concerned for Tom's safety
I'm certainly glad you're here
I'm bringing Tom along with me
I'm being treated like a child
I'm being as clear as I can be
I'm beginning to lose patience
I'm as disappointed as you are
I'm afraid that's not possible
I'm actually looking for a job
I'm actually kind of flattered
I'm a little worried about Tom
I'm a fairly well-educated guy
I'll try not to spill anything
I'll try not to disappoint you
I'll tell you everything later
I'll take care of the children
I'll take care of it from here
I'll show you what Tom gave me
I'll see you when you get here
I'll see you in a little while
I'll see you back here at 2:30
I'll see you again before then
I'll see if Tom is still awake
I'll put your name on the list
I'll pay thirty dollars for it
I'll never listen to Tom again
I'll never forget what you did
I'll meet you there in an hour
I'll meet you by the elevators
I'll make all the arrangements
I'll let you know what happens
I'll help you paint your house
I'll have to take this with me
I'll have to mention it to Tom
I'll have someone look into it
I'll go tell Tom the good news
I'll give you as much as I can
I'll get you anything you want
I'll get us a couple of drinks
I'll get Tom to drive you home
I'll get to the bottom of this
I'll get my bag out of the car
I'll get back to you about Tom
I'll find something else to do
I'll do whatever I can to help
I'll do anything I can to help
I'll decide what is irrelevant
I'll consider that possibility
I'll call you in about an hour
I'll call Tom in a few minutes
I'll be with Tom if I'm needed
I'll be thirty in three months
I'll be there in a few minutes
I'll be there as fast as I can
I'll be ready when you need me
I'll be ready in just a second
I'll be outside if you need me
I'll be more careful next time
I'll be home in a little while
I'll be here when you get back
I'll be back there in a second
I'll be back in twenty minutes
I'll be along in a few minutes
I'll answer all your questions
I'd rather not discuss it here
I'd never do a thing like that
I'd like another cup of coffee
I'd like a moment of your time
I'd do anything to be with you
I'd do almost anything for you
I'd better get back to my desk
I'd be happy to get it for you
I wouldn't want you to be late
I wouldn't let that bother you
I wouldn't know where to start
I wouldn't know where to begin
I wouldn't feel right about it
I wouldn't do that without you
I wouldn't do it any other way
I would've preferred you do it
I would've done the same thing
I wonder why Tom hasn't called
I wonder what Tom's problem is
I won't tell Tom you said that
I won't have time this evening
I woke up this morning at 6:30
I wish you could've been there
I wish Tom could've been there
I wasn't trying to fool anyone
I wasn't the one who hired Tom
I wasn't sure what size to get
I wasn't interested in the job
I wasn't going to say anything
I wasn't expecting you so soon
I wasn't even sure you knew it
I was wondering how you'd look
I want to know why you're here
I understand that you're angry
I told you it wasn't pointless
I told Tom I'd changed my mind
I told Tom I wasn't interested
I don't want Tom to be unhappy
I don't want to be in your way
I don't see why we had to help
I didn't know Tom was Canadian
Your cell phone's not working
You've written a great speech
You've taught us a great deal
You've saved Tom's life twice
You've said that to me before
You've really helped me today
You've really done a fine job
You've often said so yourself
You've got to get out of here
You've been following me
Why?
You've all underestimated Tom
You're wrong not to trust Tom
You're Tom's boss, aren't you?
You're not listening, are you?
You're not depressed, are you?
You're not asking me, are you?
You're jumping to conclusions
You're in a hurry, aren't you?
You're a believer, aren't you?
You'll always be Tom's father
You won't get a second chance
You won't even know I'm there
You should've stayed with Tom
You love your work, don't you?
You know this song, don't you?
You know about Tom, don't you?
You could've stayed in Boston
Would you tell Tom we're back?
Would you please speak to Tom?
Would you mind repeating that?
Would you get out of my light?
Will you teach me some French?
Will you teach me how to swim?
Will you be home this evening?
Why aren't you wearing gloves?
What's your girlfriend's name?
We're not supposed to be here
We're no different, you and I
We're in love with each other
We're definitely not a couple
We're about to have a meeting
We won't need your help today
We weren't expecting visitors
We don't have a swimming pool
Tom's not as bad as you think
Tom's car was in the driveway
Tom, your food's getting cold
Tom wouldn't go back to sleep
Tom wouldn't actually do that
Tom won't talk to me about it
Tom won't leave Mary with you
Tom won't know how to do that
Tom won't have any part of it
Tom won't get here until 2:30
Tom won't even talk to me now
Tom won't be happy to see you
Tom wasn't with us last night
Tom wants to go, but he can't
Tom says he won't get married
Tom isn't who you think he is
Tom didn't want to go to jail
Tom didn't look in the mirror
Tom couldn't wait to get home
Tom could've stayed in Boston
This is Tom's shirt, not mine
They won't bother you anymore
That's the solution, isn't it?
That's the question, isn't it?
Maybe we'll see some dolphins
Make sure you're here on time
It didn't use to be like this
I've studied French for years
I'm willing to take that risk
I'm very motivated to do that
I'm unfamiliar with that word
I'm unfamiliar with that term
I'm trying to save Tom's life
I'm trying to meet a deadline
I'm trying to get out of here
I'm trying to clean the house
I'm tired of dealing with you
I'm tired of covering for you
I'm tired of being your slave
I'm taking everything with me
I'm taking a leave of absence
I'm surprised you missed that
I'm surprised you don't agree
I'm sure you've misunderstood
I'm sure you're not surprised
I'm sure you'll figure it out
I'm sure you'll do a good job
I'm sure you'll be happy here
I'm sure you'll be good at it
I'm sure you know what I mean
I'm sure we can figure it out
I'm sure we all feel that way
I'm sure Tom would understand
I'm sure Tom will work it out
I'm sure Tom will get over it
I'm sure Tom will forgive you
I'm sure Tom will do the same
I'm sure Tom will be thrilled
I'm sure Tom will be relieved
I'm sure Tom will arrive soon
I'm sure Tom wasn't surprised
I'm sure Tom understands this
I'm sure Tom understands that

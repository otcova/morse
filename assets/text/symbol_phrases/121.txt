I've seen this picture before
I don't have it
She doesn't drink coffee
He doesn't drink coffee
How much for that red hat?
I had to show it to you!
Have you ever smoked?
Have you ever snored?
Have you ever spun wool?
I don't like it
It's broken
Have you ever repaired a TV?
When will Earth meet its end?
I am getting tall!
Do you know him personally?

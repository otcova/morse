People aren't rational
Tom's just your average Joe
I'm just your average Joe.
You mean Tom?
What?
Due tomorrow?
I'd eat cheese, if I had some
He's overrated

Hello, Groningen!
It's good to have friends
I've got to go to bed
It didn't start
That won't start
It won't hurt you to see Tom
The moonlight is so beautiful!
Don't do it.
But I have to.
Do you even know who that is?
Mom, I'm already an adult
Do you know who it might be?
Where is the spring?
You're going overboard
It's not worth going overboard
I think you're going overboard
Tonight there's a new moon
I admire Tom's determination
Can you only pay with cash?
He's guilty of theft
We're enjoying our vacation
So you're Extremaduran?

No, not yet.
My mom is the best!
Good morning, professor!
Where is the bed?
What is this you have done?
Why are you so far away?
Why are you hidden?
Why did you deceive us?

I'm buying some glasses
And who'll pay the bill?
And who'll settle the bill?
Do you have to cook?
Here's Tom's flat
It's taking forever
What do they have left?
Mary is prettier than me.
I don't think so.
He's Dad and he's Mom
Why don't you go to hell?
What bra cup size do you wear?
I know she doesn't love her
I know she doesn't love him
I like blueberry cake!
Shotgun!
No fair!
What's with you today?
Look!
Look!
There's a big icicle growing

It irritates, do you agree?
I'm waiting for her here
Fasten your seatbelts!
Isn't this Marie's office?
That's twenty euros

It's better not to ask
I'll give him my old computer
Here comes Tom.
What does he want now?
Here comes Tom.
What's he up to now?
Here comes Tom.
Great!
Just what I need right now.
Oh, we're dead
Do you want to shoot me dead?
What's your intention with us?
And who'll foot the bill?
They'll play football
How did you do in your exam?
Are you coming tomorrow?
Where will the flea market be?
How far away are you from us?
Where is Australia's capital?
You're wasting your effort
How could I not stumble?!
Can a moon have its own moons?
Is that so much to ask?
Free Kabylia!
Whoa, this is getting weird
Someone's going to hack you
Obviously I'll go
I don't like walking barefoot
My wife didn't want to come
Tie up your hair!
Get in the fighting spirit!
Right, let's begin!
Tie up your hair!
Enter the right frame of mind!
Right, let's begin!
Tie up your hair!
Get motivated!

How should I continue?
Whose bag is the heaviest?

Will you help me?
Yes, with pleasure
Will you please help me?
Yes, with pleasure
Will you please help me?
Yes, with pleasure.
Will you help me?
Yes, with pleasure.
You're surely tired
It's no longer moving
I couldn't find where it was
Can you drop me off here?
I'm taking your wallet
How do you two know Tom?
We weren't very close
Can you explain it to me?
What type of person is Tom?
Don't hide
It's common in the East
I think she'll like this book
Dig until you find oil!
He's a petty bourgeois
It's all due to the pandemic
Figure that one out!
The gall of some people!
That's a delicate matter
Keep going straight ahead!
I shouldn't have relied on you
I'm tired of his reproaches
Lend a helping hand?
Boys, be nimble
Are you feeling all right?
It could've been prevented
She's making her way home
Ugh!
There's veg in that!
What?
What's up?
The key's gone.
Which key?
The bike key.
What's wrong?
The key's missing.
Which key?
My bike key.
She's worried about the result
He's short on money
Tom's rudeness shocked Mary
It's fortunate he was there
Hurry up, you still have time!
I don't have time to think
I don't have time for anything
You've grown so much!
I can't manage to do it
I'm unable to do so
He's not very self-demanding
How long was he absent?
You're no one
How can you be such a liar?
I'm proud to be a doctor
But I can't do it
Where is your sister?
There she comes.
Is there cheese on the plate?
I have lunch at one o'clock
I haven't counted
I haven't counted them
They're second cousins
He's knifed
I think she's from Italy
Impressive!
He's gone travelling again
He's off on his travels again
I'm well, thanks
And you?
That's our next-door neighbour
I know all that backwards!
I know it all by heart!
Don't make yourself unhappy
They'll arrive in Rome
They're arriving in Rome
Is that your opinion?
Meanwhile, let's make some tea
Don't count on his support
Which newspaper does he take?
What newspaper does he read?
He's a clever little lad
That's just tosh
They couldn't do otherwise
The béchamel's lumpy
You're doing a brilliant job
Have you got time for a drink?
Do you have time for a drink?
So, you're on holiday?
Yes, for a week.
He's going to Chambéry?
I'll do it at home
We're really very tired
That's what I intended
We'll see them this evening
We'll see her this evening
Cry, and you cry alone
How's your girlfriend?
How is your girlfriend?
I'm coming back in two weeks
Have you got space for a tent?
Have you got room for a tent?
Ow!
My neck!
Everyone's here besides him
Everyone's here except Tom
Do you have a good car?
Do you own a nice car?
I'm waiting on a delivery
I'm waiting for a delivery
I'm expecting a shipment
You're idiots
Tom is empty-headed
Tom's head is full of sawdust
That's cursed
I hope I'll find a place!
I hope to find a place!
I hope that I'll find a place!
She's looking for an apartment
I'm not a complete idiot
Hurrying is never good.
Tell that to the ambulances.
Say that to ambulance drivers.
You've given me so much
You know what I'm going to say
I don't love anything
Is water necessary?
We'd like to sing you a song
You're overly funny!
You're too funny!
You're really funny
Very funny!
You are a funny person — right
I wonder if I'm okay?
The cinema was jam-packed
Do you have to go on about it?
Don't forget your change
He didn't know the situation
Do you know me?
No.
He's a very lively person
Where are you at?
Where to, then?
I'm hungry.
She can't live far from here
Watch out!
There's a pothole over there
I won't leave here
I'll help as I promised
What is Tom after?
Till death, we do art
You're alone with your opinion
You don't speak French
You don't speak French, Tom
That's complete nonsense
Do you like television?
I'm not eating meat
I'm drinking red wine
I don't like carrots either
It's fine, but foggy
But you don't eat vegetables!
Did you make lunch yesterday?
Did you do the work?
May I buy three oranges?
I don't want to buy rice today
Did I make dinner yesterday?
No, you made breakfast
Did you make breakfast today?
Are you ironing?
Do you like to eat supper?

Has he worn the new suit yet?
Have you worn the suit?
Do you like Mary's blouse?
Where is the Christmas party?
Thank you for my presents!
Enjoy your retirement!
Cookie, you wanna go outside?
Now I'm alone; we can talk
Don't embarrass me!
Will the goods arrive in time?
No, there is no devil!
Where is the devil?
Have you lost your soul?
Is there a ghost here?
Does Mary use incense?
Mary's pencil is in the office
Tom likes Mary's pencil
Can I borrow the ruler?
Have you broken the pencil?
Where is the spare compass?
Whose compass is this?
Who has lost an eraser?
Mary doesn't like paying taxes
What is the film about?
What is the movie about?
It's beyond my understanding
So, what do you want from me?
Wait a minute!
Don't hang up!
Wait a minute!
Don't hang up the phone!
Who is hosting today's party?
He's going to find out
She's going to find out
It's a whole number
It's not a whole number
It isn't an integer
He doesn't want to do anything
I'm thinking of doing nothing
I've always been crazy
Do you want to sign up?
Do you want to join in?
The more you work, the better
The more you study, the better
The later you go, the worse
She's turning her back on me
She's turning away from me
Hallelujah!
He's sure to come
He'll definitely come
A few people were ice-skating
He's in a bad state of health
Where was this produced?
Where was that produced?
It's an export product
Where was it produced?
I didn't sell the backpack
I don't pick out their clothes
He doesn't have any experience
Does he have green eyes?
Does she have green eyes?
Do you have green eyes?
Are you going to shower?
Mary won't give up
Is he about to be a father?
Are you about to be a father?
I can't stand that heat
Mine, with milk
I'm tired of talking to you!
I'm house-sitting
I'm taking care of the house
I'm watching the house
I'm looking after the house
Who likes to sleep?
Why did you leave me alone?
I'm going to see it
Are you going to want more?
I don't have employees
He doesn't want to talk to me
You'll be informed
I've always been mad
Is Tom still angry with you?
Mary has whitefish-like hands
Your stepfather is very nice.
I love my stepmother!
I wish I could've seen it
How soon can that be done?
Did you thank Tom?
No, I'm not from the city
This newspaper is yesterday's
You don't need it, my love
I didn't buckle up
I didn't fasten my seatbelt
What have you put in there?
What have you put in it?
What did you put in it?
The fork's gone
He's about to leave for Canada
About five in the morning.
And when did you go to bed?
Just after ten.
I don't feel like it today
I'll do it tomorrow.
At last it's stopped raining
Meow," said the cat
Where are you going?
Toronto.
You'll be fine.
I've only got vague memories
Summer, stay a bit longer!
Well, have fun playing chess!
I'll pick you up in an hour
How many are on the list?
How long is the list?
I can't hear you!
The wind is buffeting my ears!
What?
He's a cratedigger
She's a cratedigger
You're making me nervous
I'm in enough trouble as it is
She asked a passer-by the way
Blimey!
Swiss trains have got the lot!
The meeting's about to start
How about baking some today?
Tom?
What are you doing here?
Why wasn't I on the list?
I don't intend to quit
I really can't figure out why
May God be with you!
Ah, so that is your thinking!
Is it always so cold here?
You fucking bastard!
How can you be so patient?
Let's boil potatoes
Why is my VPN so slow?
I've had more than enough
The bellows aren't working
Will you do the dishes?
Will you clean the dishes?
Will you wash the dishes?
I've already finished the job
I've given up on that case
I've already written a letter
I've recently given up smoking
I've finished my assignment
I suppose they're coming
Babies cry when they're hungry
It's been snowing on and off
I don't remember anything
I must've passed out
Do you have room for a tent?
It's finally stopped raining
The path wasn't clearly marked
This isn't the Tom that I knew
I’ll smell it on the tree
However, I will resign
You're a little out of place
He's always fidgeting
He's lingering
Best 2 out of 3?
You're on.
Tom is sane?
His doctor must confirm this!
Who's taking charge here?
I'm about to catch the fish
Props to you!
School finishes at 3.30 p.m
Hopes rose, but only briefly
Has the sun gone down yet?
Has the sun set yet?
I meant to ring, but I forgot
I meant to phone, but I forgot
I'm in a fix
I'm in a bind
It's not yet dry
Are you driving to Boston?
We can't admit it
We can't allow it
Are you in your right mind?
It's about time that you work!
I wonder if I'm OK
I'm sorry about last time
I think I must've passed out
Who's hosting today's party?
We're learning to swim
I've broken something
I promised I'd help
I'm going to barf
Are you going to listen to me?
What did Tom forget about?
It's just a slight cold
You're my brother, Tom
I can't pronounce French well
Tom's cats love me
What's a Furby?
Is there a third option?
Is there a door number 3?
Which notes?
Which marks?
Respect isn't a right
It's something you earn
Something isn't right!
They're still looking for Tom
It's pretty cold out here
I don't know many French words
It seems like a winter's day
Do you want to dance together?
He has up to 300 books
He has as many as 300 books
They're not our cars
Pardon me, but do not forget
Is your name Marek?
The number 2011 has two ones
Where did they go that day?
Obviously, I like beer
She didn't respond to my call
Don't fall, please
Can he write his last name?
I'm not listening to him
Can I try your bread?
I'm flying in an airplane
Don't go back to Rome!
I know she's capable of it
How much do I owe you?
Five dollars.
How much do I owe you?
Nothing.
How much do I owe you?
You don't owe me anything.
Ah, a Volvo.
Really?
Of course not!
I don't have one.
In Australia.
Amazing!
See you!
Hope you don't trip on stage.
That man is an odious person!
That man is a horrible person!
That man is a hateful person!
We're at the mercy of the mob
I don't fit in this seat
I can't fit into this seat
I'm part of the problem
We didn't get any ticket
Have you eaten my biscuits?
Did you eat my biscuits?
She's kind by nature
Wakey wakey, rise and shine!
There's a lot to do today!
Her friend is from Ceará
Her boyfriend is from Ceará
It's quoted out of context
That's quoted out of context
It's bucketing down tonight
Who just left this room?
Huh?
Is it ok for her to do that?
Of course, it's her paid leave
Alright.
Where did they find her?
Where did they find it?
I'm not going to read that
Tom died mid-selfie
I've never seen such a thing
I've booked a table for four
I must be there before 2:30
I don't know which is worse
I can't read this contract
Do you eat like the Italians?
I don't like conflict
He'll leave soon
I've always liked challenges
Don't want to know
It's already 11
It's painful and hard to talk
I put them in my pocket.
I'd like a bob haircut please.
Will there be a blackout?
Or should I say, buy me one!
Buy one yourself.
Er, yeah
It's only small though.
It's not a PayPass card
How about this Totoro necktie?
Where is the dressing room?
Or wine?
Tom's garden was vandalised
He who dares, wins
Oh, I completely forgot
Sorry!
We've already tried that
Who'd like to learn French?
Such a person doesn't exist
Tom wouldn't approve of that
I'm not in love with Mary
We're just good friends
Why's everyone looking at Tom?
I'd never seen a real elephant
I shouldn't have done that
Did Tom show you the picture?
I'm proud of you
I'm glad for you, too
I plan to be here until 2:30
Today is my birthday, too
Today's my birthday.
It's my birthday today, too.
Tom doesn't like music
I don't drink white wine
It's overcast today
I've written a letter
Sorry, but I can't go with you
I'll call Tom before I leave
Are you going to learn French?
What's a computer hard drive?
Everyone lies!
I won't wait another minute
I won't let Tom destroy you
Orcas aren't whales
They're dolphins
The toll's going up
Do you know it?
Good, you can go home
I didn't go to Boston by plane
I don't understand French
It's difficult
The plane gets in at 2:30
I'd rather walk than go by bus
Do you know about wines?
When shall we leave?
He didn't come
We're going to get coffee
Who are we in fact?
He didn't mention you
No shoes, no service
I'm studying at Harvard
Tom's plane has just landed
I've arrived at work
I've had a stroke before
I've just had a good idea
I'm now in Boston now
I know I'm not very romantic
I can't understand anything
Sure!

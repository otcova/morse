He can't feel his legs
I was really amazed!
You're parked illegally
There's a cat in the kitchen
How are we better than them?
I'm off to work now
We'll keep our fingers crossed
Sooner or later, it'll happen
Let's try this once more
You're lucky you're cute
You don't know what I feel
Sit still, please
This post is worth a bump!
You weren't afraid, were you?
He's exiled
He's banished
He's in exile
I think that's urgent
Did he want to see me?
America isn't a country
It's a continent
It's not a deal-breaker
Does Tom need Mary's help?
What's going on, Jean?
Long live Ido!
Meat your maker !
Will you help me, please?
Does Tom blame Mary?
I'm not doing anything
You're just paranoid
Here's your book back
I'd be happy to go
This good weather won't last
Are you logged in?
Does Tom have a PhD?
How early it too early?
I'd love to meet your son
I'd love to meet your daughter
What are Tom's credentials?
I'm walking down the street
Tom asked me if I'd slept OK
The girl is left-handed
I'll show you a few photos
Could you turn around, please?
We won't be able to replace it
Could you please turn around?
Can I go to the bathroom?
I've never seen eggs that big
They'll murder him
They're going to murder him
Maybe Tom won't be there today
What a scandal!
Maybe Tom isn't there today
Maybe Tom isn't here today
It's important to be honest
It's fall
Global warming hasn't stopped
I guarantee that won't happen
It's time for you to make up
It was a dinosaur, for real!
You're doing great
It's suffocating in here
The sidewalk's slippery
Hey, stop complaining
Sweet!
Awesome!
Wow!
Tom can't drive, you know
Tom drives an old pick-up
How large is your hard drive?
You obviously don't drive
Tom wasn't a good driver
Tom's car was easy to drive
Come on, I'll drive you home
Tom can't drive at night
Is Tom still a taxi driver?
Is Tom a taxi driver?
Why did Tom drive there?
Why didn't Tom drive there?
Tom can't drive now
How far of a drive is it?
What's driving Tom?
Tom isn't a cab driver
Who drove you here?
It's enough to drive you crazy
Can Tom drive Mary home?
Did Tom drive Mary home?
Can you drive Tom here?
I'm never let Tom drive my car
Where did you drive Tom?
It's my turn to drive today
Let's drive to the beach today
Could you turn off the light?
What are you saying?
I don't understand!
Why would Yanni kill Skura?
Sales tax isn't included
I'll need to change my plans
Who helped you?
It was Tom.
Me too.
Yanni can't read Skura's lips
Yanni's children loved him
I still love you.
Go to hell.
You're gonna be a grandad
Skura is pregnant.
It's not my baby.
Skura's baby came early
Skura's baby was full term
This didn't surprise Yanni
Hello!
I miss you!
Please stop calling me here.
Yanni knew the baby wasn't his
That's enough yapping
Stop chit-chatting and work
I've decided to quit.
Can we stay for the weekend?
Fine!
You win!
Yanni isn't providing enough
Yanni isn't working enough
Yanni isn't earning enough
Yanni isn't exercising enough
Yanni isn't eating enough
Yanni's anger simmered
Yanni's surgery was postponed
Are Yanni's kids OK?
Yanni's kids are safe at home
Who would do that to Yanni?
Yanni cut Skura's jugulars
Yanni is one of Ziri's hitmen
Yanni was very good-looking
Dad is getting married.
That son of a bitch!
In fact he's even frightening
Mary is a shepherd, isn't she?
This eagle's wings are broken
And who's the bitch?
Show some respect.
There's here to stay
What do you mean?
I've been fired.
You've got to be kidding me.
I'm gonna smash your face.
Really?
Be my guest.
She's an astronaut
What kind of a man does this?
I've just got off work
You just shot me!
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, sweetheart!
Call an ambulance.
911
What's your emergency?
I just shot my husband.
Is he breathing?
I don't know.
Could you check?
I can't.
Where is he right now?
Tom's a bad person
Yanni won't see his dad again
Skura had four ex-husbands
Yanni is Skura's counselor
That's taboo
You're not supposed to do that
Yanni didn't seem to care
Yanni exploited Skura's needs
Yanni didn't say anything
Yanni won't say anything
That doesn't seem likely
Stay with Tom, Mary
Yanni didn't see that woman
Yanni wasn't moving
I've forgotten the money
Or can you?
He's gone with Maria to Boston
He's always lived in Tokyo
Yanni's wine is very sweet
Yanni's phone was ringing
Yanni doesn't care anymore
Yanni didn't apologize
Yanni can't go anywhere
Yanni's grocery store is small
I'm not going into that
No one likes to be stared at.
Yanni shouldn't have done that
Yanni didn't find that funny
Yanni doesn't find that funny
You won't live forever
Yanni doesn't remember Skura
Just sit here and he'll come
Yanni doesn't want to do this
Yanni is Skura's customer
Yanni didn't mind Skura at all
Do you like this class?
Who invited Tom?
Is your suitcase locked?
Bump!
Shall we go to the beach?
He's in excellent health
We didn't see the patient
I'm very full
Where's my magazine?
I have a son who's an athlete
Have you ever tweeted?
Can I speak with Pedro?
You look kind of down?
Did anyone get arrested?
Is that a cat or my pants?
How's the soup?
What's the soup du jour?
I'm always angry
I'm angry all the time
I'm hungry all the time
I'm never angry
I'm never hungry
I've never told a lie
What's Ido?
He's a spationaut
That's no longer happening
I'm very sad now
We'll help you sort it out
It's harsh but true
It's been Tom all along
Don't drink the bathwater
We'll get though this
That's an error
Tell Tom I'm taking a bath
How do you use bath salts?
I don't want to take a bath
We're remodeling our bathroom
What's needed is practice
Let's play badminton on Monday
We'll play badminton on Monday
Who ordered the pizza?
How did you know?
I can't do that today
There isn't much sunlight now
You're really crazy

Why is Tom yelling at me?
What was Tom shouting about?
What was Tom screaming about?
Why was Tom yelling?
Why was Tom shouting?
Why was Tom screaming?
I don't usually do it this way
There aren't any flowers here
It's good to hear your voice
Go and help Tom, Mary
Yanni wasn't there
I'm done eating
The legionnaires took Skura..
Don't steal them!
Thank you both!
Do you like chicken?
I hope Tom didn't get lost
Is this part of a joke?
Is that part of a joke?
Yanni's story is false
I saw you kissing that bitch.
Wait, let me explain.
Don't touch me, you dirty pig!
I said don't touch me!
The church is God's house
I couldn't hold it anymore
Can you weigh this package?
I had a strange dream.
What was it about?
Can you send it to New York?
I don't need friends
Tom doesn't even go here
Tom doesn't even work here
Let me die!
Just more of the same!
If you want my help, just ask
What's causing these fires?
Yanni's nose got runny
Yanni has Covid-19
Yanni liked Skura's video
Yanni's parents are Algerian
Yanni didn't have a phone
Yanni just sat there, crying
Yanni wasn't used to that
Yanni isn't paying for that
That's what Yanni said
Yanni can't go any faster
Yanni a co-worker
Yanni didn't talk to Skura
What can I get for you today?
Yanni finishes at four o'clock
Yanni couldn't read the menu
When do you serve breakfast?
My name is Skura, not Skua
Yanni can't read the menu
He's illiterate
Yanni didn't help Skura
Yanni's hands were full
Yanni didn't order anything
Yanni didn't order this

The bleeding won’t stop
My skin is itchy!
I can’t stop scratching!
Yanni doesn't have a car
Yanni knows he's ready
My arm is sore!
I”ve got very little energy
That won't help the situation
I think I’ve pulled a muscle
Can we do it?
Yes, we can
Can you do it with me?
Everyone knows Yanni's school
Yanni doesn't know why
Yanni wasn't cheating on Skura
Yanni wasn't OK
Yanni wasn't mad
My name is Skura, not Skrua
Why did Yanni do that?
Yanni isn't a party animal
Stage one: denial
Yanni didn't care
Yanni had a party until 4 am
Yanni doesn't know
Yanni's friends called him
Yanni's dog started growling
Yanni's dog is not aggressive
That's the way dogs are
Yanni's dog followed Skura
Yanni held Skura's hand
Yanni doesn't condone violence
This won't happen overnight

Marvellous!
It'll be a pretty close game

To me, this is a big deal
I'll drive Tom to the station
Did you get sunburned?
I'm not actually from here
How did Tom tell Mary?
Whose truck is that?
You don't know what I owe you
Stop being a cat!
I don't want us to get lost!
You're telling me?
Tom couldn't stop Mary
There's too much snow!
When will the wedding be?

What a life!
Do you have class on Saturday?
Wait a bit, please
Have you?
We're willing to help
It's Tom's problem, not mine
Can you write hiragana?
There's no way Tom is Canadian
Which would be better for you?
Come on, I'll walk you home

It was about a three-mile walk
I'll walk you to the door
I'm too tired to walk home
Tom doesn't walk anywhere
Would you like to come along?
The king shits, the pope shits
Now he's walking quite well
Do you have any bad habits?
If so, what are they?
I think I'll hire you.
Are you Yanni?
Yes.
I'm so glad to meet you.
I'm going to divorce Skura.

I hope Tom doesn't notice that
We'd hoped Tom would win
I hope it isn't me
Is Tom going to do that?
I hope not.
Well, there's still hope
I've asked for a raise
I'm sorry, but I can't come
Luckily, we succeeded
Luckily, we were succesful
You're lucky that you're cute
Something's in my eye
We're hoping it isn't true
That's where Tom lives
Let's hope no one comes
I hope you'll like Tom

I'm scared, too
The crocodile didn't move
This blue thing isn't yellow
You're hungry already?
I get sleepy when I'm full
You see that, right?
Did you lock all the doors?
Tom isn't a big spender
Yanni never brushes his teeth.
Disgusting.
You're too much!
I've spent a lot of time here
Yanni is Skura's grandpa
What's Yanni's story?
Yanni's family is poor
That doesn't matter for Yanni
Yanni isn't an adult
What is Yanni like?
Would you marry me?
Sure!
You can't spend the night here
It's as his name suggests
Inhale, and exhale
Breathe in, and breathe out
You can see that, can't you?
Are you hungry already?
Mary has a walk-in closet
Did you hear the latest?
Who took my bag?
I'd like to buy one of those
Are these for sell?
Would you like to buy one?
Who told you how to do that?
I'll fly to the moon
It's easy to learn
You can't get luck
I like that there's no one
You're going to be like
It's too late now to be sorry
Everyone, clean your rooms
I don't like being late

Reading isn't easy
I'm sure it'll be over soon
I don't like doing it
I don't plan on doing it
Yes, I'm the most modest
Yes, I'm the most humble
I can't see things clearly
It's been a week since he left
I don't wear a tie
I don't know why he left
It's still damp
Tom's house was easy to find
You don't want to trip
That you're really sorry?
Tom said that he'd buy a truck
Tom said he'd buy a truck
I hope I'll be able to go
Why did Tom buy this?
Shoot!
Why do I never get a turn?
Aren't you tired?
I know when I've been bested
I need to find a part-time job
That's not me
Where did Tom buy this cello?
Why did Tom buy that hat?
You're a pilot, aren't you?
I can't find my razor
Where do I swipe my card?
Me neither!
Where is your store located?
Where is your garage located?
What are their hours?
Of course, Mom.
What services do you offer?
What's the soup of the day?
I'm really full
I'll show you a few pictures
I think that that's urgent
Come over here!
No, wait, wait!
What are you doing, Yanni?
You're hurting me!
No!
Help!
Somebody!
Help!
Can I get a bottle of water?
Still or sparkling?

That person is transgender.
Why are you wearing earrings?
I'm a girl.

Ipek, jump rope!
He's been like an idiot
I don't know who could help me
I'm missing one
When did the notice arrive?
How are you getting it back?
Don't tell me stupid things
I'm Belgian, what about you?
We're a team, aren't we?
There's no more red wine
I think she's happy
It's 1am; time to go home
Did you get a reply?
You are very kind, ma'am
I missed the train!
His son died and now he's dead
Hit him with your head!
I must call him right now!
Mom, it's too late at night.
Don't blame us!
I can't see your son
Is she Dutch?
May we talk in private?
In the end, I gave up
Do you have a girlfriend?
Yes, I do.
Cut it with a knife!
I can't drink beer

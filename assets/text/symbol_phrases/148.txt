I should've expected it
I simply don't have the time
I still don't have an answer
I still don't know the rules
I still don't remember why
I still don't think it's fair
I suggest we don't even try
I swear I didn't see Tom

I won't let Tom do that
I won't let Tom hurt you
I won't tell if you won't
I won't tell them a thing
I won't try to describe it
I'd better clean up now
I'd better get back home
I'd better get out of here
I'd better get to work
I'd better go check on Tom
I'd better go get ready
I'd better go see who that is
I'd better go study

I'd better see what's going on
I'd better take a look at it
I'd better take you home
I'd better turn the engine off
I'd better wake Tom up
I'd better warn Tom
I'd decided to throw that away
I'd hoped to see Tom in Boston
I'd hoped to speak with Tom
I'd hoped you might be here
I'd never done it before
I'd never met Tom before
I'll be honest with you
I'll buy a gift for Tom
I'll call you in a week
I'll come, too
I'm a beginner in French

I'm not scared of you anymore
I'm not scared to die
I'm off-duty
I'm proud to be a Canadian
I'm puzzled
I'm sober
I'm sorry I broke my promise
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that
I'm sorry, I don't buy it
I'm sorry, I don't understand
I'm sure Tom didn't mean it
I'm sure Tom didn't mean that
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you
I'm sure Tom will complain
I'm your boyfriend, aren't I?

I've got some problems
I've got some very good news
I've got somebody with me
I've got something better
I've got something to do
I've got things to do
I've got to do my chores
I've got to do something first
I've got to get back to work
I've got to get going

I've got to get to work
I've got to head back to work
I've got to help Tom

I've never tried
It's the bite of a spider
I can't pick this lock
I can't say I'm shocked
I didn't think I should drive
I don't feel very well
I don't know how to use it
I don't know what it's for
I don't think I can do it
I haven't eaten all day
I just can't help it
I just can't help myself
I just can't help
I just can't live without you
I just can't remember
I just can't take it
I just can't wait to do that
I just can't wait
That's all
I just couldn't do it anymore
I just couldn't say no to Tom
I just couldn't stay away
I just didn't know what to do
I just didn't know what to say
I just do what I'm told
I just don't know how to do it
I just don't know what to do
I just don't think I can do it
That's all
That's all
I just gave Tom 30 dollars
I just haven't had a chance
Tom isn't drinking green tea
That's a spider bite
Where's the nearest bank?
You're capable
That's even better

Now pay attention, children
Mr. Smith is drinking coffee
How do you know his name?
How do you know her name?
He's not jealous
She's jealous
How are things at home?
Mary's jealous
How are things at school?
They're jealous
You're not jealous
I'll always remember you
It's healthy for your body
You're my only real friend
He's my only real friend
She's my only real friend
I'm certain that you saw Tom
And what was the reason?
That’s the first point
That’s actually the truth
But it wasn't over yet
That’s what we heard
I'm going to have a rest
Tony said he didn't know
I'm curious about his past
Straighten up!
Stand straight!
Guess who?
John didn't see anybody
She's not sleepy
My neighbor's a real mysophobe
You asked about her?
What did she say?
It's because it's too big
She's wearing red
He hasn't got the foggiest
Tom knows that he's right
We don't like math
I don't like math
I'm in a very nice house
Laurie's sick
Who're you talking to, clown?
Who're you talking to, fool?
Is your mom at home?
Is your mom home?
You're a funny young lady
My dress doesn't fit anymore!
My jeans won't fit
My jeans won't fit
Did they shrink?
She's a size four
I will love you forever!
Would you like to help me?
Could you add me?
Thanks, you're fantastic!
You're a great teacher!
I'm not changing their name
I don't censor their articles
Thanks for helping me!
I don't censor your articles
I'm not gelding your calves
I'm not breaking your idols
How old are you?
I'm twenty-six years old
How old are you?
I'm twenty-six
I don't hurt your animals
I'm not hurting your animals
It's never too late..
Do you speak Kashubian?
I just hope I'm ready
I just hope it's not too late
I just hope you're right
I just like to know I'm right
I just need Tom's help
I just need you here, OK?
I'm not a real doctor
Would you mind?
How much is the fare to Bikol?
He's as tall as his father
I just couldn't sleep
I just shot someone, I think
I just spoke to Tom's doctors
I just think it's funny
I just thought I'd drop by
I just thought I'd mention it
I just told Tom we're dating
I just want what's best for us
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
I just wasn't paying attention
I just wish you'd talk to me
I just wish you'd trust me
I kept hoping I'd meet Tom
I killed Tom in self-defense
I kind of hope it doesn't rain
I knew how you'd react
I knew I couldn't trust Tom
I knew I should've stayed home
I knew I should've taken that
I knew I'd find you with Tom
I knew I'd seen it before
I knew it was you, Tom
I knew it wasn't you
I knew it wouldn't last
I knew it wouldn't work
I knew this wouldn't work
I knew Tom wasn't dead
I knew Tom wouldn't be here
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you
I knew we couldn't trust Tom
I knew we'd find Tom
I knew we'd find you
I knew we'd win
I'll be glad to help!
April 1st, 2013 is a Monday
I knew he wasn't Tom
I knew you could do it, Tom
I knew you couldn't do it
I knew you wouldn't abandon me
I knew you wouldn't believe me
I knew you wouldn't forget me
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom
I knew you wouldn't understand
I knew you'd ask about that
I knew you'd be angry
I knew you'd be back
I knew you'd be happy
I knew you'd be here
I knew you'd be hungry
I knew you'd be in here
I knew you'd be thrilled
I knew you'd be tired
I knew you'd be upset
I knew you'd bring that up
I knew you'd come after me
I knew you'd come back
I knew you'd come home
I knew you'd come to save me
I knew you'd find me
I knew you'd find Tom
I knew you'd go there
I knew you'd have a good time
I knew you'd help me
I knew you'd like that
I knew you'd make it
I knew you'd mess things up
I knew you'd miss me
I knew you'd never let Tom die
I knew you'd protect me
I knew you'd quit
I knew you'd say that

I'd like a window seat, please
Would you like a window seat?
We make the total about $50
The sum came to 3,000 yen
Run, or else you'll be late
How about running?
Don't run, walk slowly
Is there a mileage charge?
Don't make noise
Hold your breath, please
Take a deep breath, please
Don't be so hard on your son
What does your son do?
I'd like to see my son
My son can't count yet
Let's ease up
I've got blisters on my feet
We're short of something
Come home early, Bill.
Yes, Mother.
I can't keep pace with you
Don't pull my sleeve
The loss adds up to $1,000,000
Let's make it a fair trade
Did you want anything else?
I can't think otherwise
Need anything else?
Anything else, sir?
What else do you want?
Is there anything I must do?
May I recommend another hotel?
Do you have any others?
Could you show me another one?
Where are all the others?
I can't think of anybody else
Learn from others' mistakes
Two wrongs don't make a right
Be kind to others!
Don't rely on others
Don't worry about others
Don't stare others in the face
Don't get in people's way
Do other people like me?
Don't make fun of others
Don't look down on others
Let's not stand on ceremony
You shouldn't rely on others
We can pay 100 dollars at most
We can pay 200 dollars at most
Don't let them down

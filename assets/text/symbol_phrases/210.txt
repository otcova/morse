You can't force me to go
Let me show you what I've got
My eyesight isn't very good

Are you sure it was a ghost?
What does the winner get?
How hot is it going to get?
How cold is it going to get?
How hot will it get?
How cold will it get?
Are you afraid of the future?
Come on, let's have some fun
Wasn't that a lot of fun?
It's actually kind of fun
This really isn't funny
Is this supposed to be funny?
What do you two do for fun?
Was that supposed to be fun?
It's not supposed to be fun
There's a BMW parked out front
Does Tom have many friends?
How long have we been friends?
Tom isn't my boyfriend
He's just a friend

Would you care for some food?
Tom didn't water the flowers
Why did Tom send Mary flowers?
Why is that on the floor?
There's blood on the floor
It's not that long a flight
Why is that light flashing?
Dolphins aren't fish
Did Tom say why he was fired?
That's why Tom was fired
I think I'm going to get fired
It's still not finished
What exactly did you find?
It's time to stop fighting
Have you two been fighting?
Are you two having a fight?
It wasn't really a fight
It wasn't much of a fight
Look, I know how you feel
Do I look as bad as I feel?
Could you do me one favor?
It might not be Tom's fault
You've done a good job so far
Tom isn't a huge football fan
Perhaps it's a fake
Maybe it's a fake
What caused the power failure?
There's a better explanation
It's not easy to explain
It's very difficult to explain
It'll take too long to explain

Actually, it's hard to explain
It's kind of hard to explain
It's really not that expensive
There'll be a lot of expenses
What else could we expect?
Do you get enough exercise?
I'm sick of your excuses
It's really kind of exciting
What does that mean exactly?
What's that mean exactly?
What is Tom's job exactly?
There's plenty for everyone
Have you met everybody?
There's still time to evacuate
Were you trying to escape?
How did you manage to escape?
There's a back entrance
Maybe that's not enough
Tom hasn't been eating enough
That should've been enough
It's time for this to end
It's kind of an emergency
It's kind of embarrassing
Did you see anything else?
Did you find anything else?
Would you care to elaborate?
What else did you eat?
Wasn't that a little too easy?
It hasn't always been easy
It couldn't have been easy
Does it ever get easier?

What precisely did you do?
Are you writing this down?
Would you please slow down?
All right, let's settle down
How did you track me down?
Why not break the door down?
Could you please calm down?
Maybe Tom's car broke down

Do you remember what to do?
What did you expect us to do?
What did you expect Tom to do?
What were you trying to do?

What else do we need to do?
There's still so much to do
There's just too much to do
That's a risky thing to do
There wasn't much else to do
That's what Tom should do
It's what rich people do
Would you open the door?
Shouldn't we lock the door?
Could you close the door?
There's a padlock on the door
There's no lock on the door
What would you normally do?
Did you get any work done?
Is this really how it's done?

Are you a real doctor?
Why didn't you call a doctor?
Do you need to see a doctor?

Is that the best we can do?
That's why we got divorced

There's room for discussion
Are you in any difficulty?
That wouldn't be too difficult
It wouldn't be too difficult
That shouldn't be so difficult
That shouldn't be difficult
Why is everything different?
Do you feel any different?
Does it make any difference?
How soon am I going to die?
How old was Tom when he died?
Do you regret what you did?
Why did Tom do what he did?

It's difficult to describe
I'm dehydrated
It's the right decision
Tom didn't like our decision
This isn't an easy decision
Have you reached a decision?
What are you trying to decide?
It's not open for debate
What was the cause of death?
All right, here's the deal
That wasn't part of the deal
What's it like to be deaf?
What's your plan for the day?
Are you finished for the day?
It's only been three days
It's going to take a few days
It's sort of a rainy day
I don't see Tom every day
It's been a difficult day
How about a game of darts?
It's starting to get dark
There's no other damage
There's no sign of any damage
Were you close to your dad?
It's an old custom
Why is everybody crying?
How long has Tom been crying?
Are you all completely crazy?
Tom didn't die in the crash
Did the plane crash?
Tom isn't my brother
He's my cousin
That's not entirely correct
Did you think I was a cop?
Why did you become a cop?
Are you going to cooperate?
Isn't that kind of cool?
That wasn't very convincing
Is it all under control?
Is that the remote control?
Tom didn't win the contest
It's contagious
It's worth considering
Tom must've been confused
These aren't ideal conditions
What's the other condition?
Did you enjoy the concert?
There's no cause for concern
There's no need for concern
What's wrong with my computer?
It's kind of complicated
It's not really a competition
Who's the second in command?

How are the repairs coming?
It's really not that cold
It's going to get even colder

Do we have any other choice?
That's an interesting choice
It's a game for children
Have you tried the chicken?
Do you have any cream cheese?
Who put you in charge?
Are you the person in charge?
Who's the person in charge?
Perhaps it's time for a change
Maybe it's time for a change
There'll be no second chances
Do you know Tom by any chance?
That's quite a challenge
Are you absolutely certain?

This'll make you feel better
Where on earth can Tom be?
Where's it supposed to be?
What's that supposed to be?
Where's Tom supposed to be?
It's not the way it used to be
It's where it's supposed to be
What else could there be?
How hard could it possibly be?
That's pretty hard to believe
How important can it be?
How hard could it be?
How complicated could it be?
Why not leave it behind?
Did Tom leave anything behind?
We're ready to begin
Have I ever met you before?
Is it worse than before?
This wasn't here before
It's the same as before
Is there any more beer?
Who else might it have been?
What else could it have been?
There's no room under the bed
Shouldn't you still be in bed?
How badly was Tom beaten?
How long have you had a beard?
Where's the nearest bathroom?
That's not my baseball bat
What else was in the basket?
What are you using for bait?
It's really not too bad
Is it really that bad?
It's really not that bad
Maybe it's not that bad
It couldn't have been that bad
This place isn't so bad
Are you saying I smell bad?
How did you hurt your back?
We'll call you back
How will I find my way back?
Are you ready to go back?
Why isn't Tom fighting back?
When's Tom expected back?
I'll be back
It's not too late to walk away
It's about three meters away
How long have you been awake?
It's probably still available
Is it still up in the attic?
May I have your attention?
What church do you attend?
Are they planning an attack?
What are you kids staring at?
What are you two staring at?
What are you all looking at?
Well, what are you good at?
That's a reasonable assumption
Was Tom here when you arrived?
How did you hurt your arm?
There's no time to argue
What do you think these are?
What do you suppose these are?
Look, I owe you an apology
There's no need for an apology
It's too late for apologies
How old are you anyway?
What do you guys want anyway?
What was your plan anyway?
Why does it matter anyway?
What's Tom doing here anyway?
Can I help with anything?
How would that solve anything?
Do I need to sign anything?
Did you bring me anything?
This isn't helping anything
Do you need me to do anything?
How does that change anything?
Does it really matter anymore?
I won't do it anymore
This isn't funny anymore
It's just not fun anymore
Tom isn't my boyfriend anymore
Have you ever shot anybody?
Have you ever killed anybody?
There's no other answer
Would you say I was annoying?
Did you hear the announcement?
Tom didn't seem angry
Are you as hungry as I am?
Are you as bored as I am?
Did you call an ambulance?
There's another alternative
Are you two not getting along?
How are things coming along?
Would you mind coming along?
Have you been here all along?
I'll never leave you alone
I don't trust Tom at all
It isn't unusual at all
This doesn't look good at all
It's not complicated at all
It isn't complicated at all
It's about thirty yards ahead
That wasn't there a minute ago
Where were you an hour ago?
What else is on the agenda?
Can we try this again?
Do we need to do this again?
Come on, let's do this again
Come on, let's do that again
There's that sound again
Why can't we do it again?
All right, let's try it again
What's Tom doing here again?
Are you two fighting again?
Don't do that ever again
Is Tom coming back again?
I'll call you this afternoon
What else would you advise?
It's not easy being an adult
It's quite complex actually

What's the meeting about?
What is Tom so mad about?
What's Tom so mad about?
What are you grinning about?
What was all the fuss about?
What was Tom confused about?
It's not worth arguing about
What did they argue about?
What are you so angry about?
It's on page 3
Please come back at 2:30
That'll take a couple of hours
Do you have another opinion?
I didn't say a single word
I haven't smoked for years
You're going to love Tom
What wonderful news!
You're a friend of Thomas
No, I was at home!
He's a brown noser
Tom is nervous, too
Wood doesn't grow on trees

You're not romantic at all
At the time, you were outside
I'm really busy at the moment

Would you like to watch TV?
Will you take me home?
That's dead easy
I don't want to post it
Damn it!
To hell with it!
What puerile behaviour!
Grow up!
I spent last night at Tom's
Tom finishes his shift at 2:30
My birthday is October 20th
Can you please say that again?
I'd like to see Tom again
Tom's very annoying
Is he a good kisser?
Is he a good kisser?
Tom does everything well.
I don't like spiders
It wasn't a fair fight
After that, what happened?
I don't know if we needed that
Hi, are you Tom?
Tom's very hard-working
Tom isn't really happy
Of course, we might be biased
I'm not applauding you
We'll meet wherever you want

Do you like figure skating?

However, I have been in Italy
How do you get on?
Tom is out, but Mary is here
Do you like it here?
Do you need a grater?
What's that?
This is a peach.
He's renting the room
That wasn't very clever
I think I'm resolute
Are you working today?
Can you please repeat that?
Tom wouldn't let Mary do that
Tom hasn't actually done that
I knew we should've done that
How did they dance!
Not like opera-dancers

I'll stay home and study
Is he always like this?
Is he always like this?
Yeah, he is.
Don't be embarrassed, Tom
Don't put anything on the box
Panicking won't help
Yeah, something like that

Don't interrupt me again
I'm afraid to stay alone
That's very annoying
Aren't you missing anyone?
They don't owe me anything
When does Tom arrive?
Do you play basketball?
Why must I suffer?
You know I don't like it
Do you have wet wipes?
I'll do everything for you

It's best to tell the truth
How come you know him so well?
Finish to eat!
Woof, this was a tough one
Tom, it's your mother
Do you love her?
What?
Do you love her?
That's none of your business!
She's job hunting

Watch out!
It's a trap!
I'm washing dishes
She's washing dishes
He's washing dishes
We're washing dishes
They're washing dishes
Ow!
You shitface!
You crashed into me!
Has your face been harmed?
I'm sorry.
No shit, Sherlock!
Look at my face.
Your face looks fine to me.
It hurts.
Whatever.
Fix my face." "...
Fix it!
Whatever.
I haven't got any reply so far
You're about to cry
Quiet," he whispered
Where is the hammer?
You've already eaten the cake?
It's also the last.
Objection!
I'm going to 'Blockbuster'.
You're screwed.
Oah!
I woke up just after 2:30
Why did you leave Australia?

So how can we—" "Great!
I'll grab my sword!
There is no sword.
Huh?
There is no sword!" "...
Here is a skull axe.
No.
No.
How about smoke bombs?
No.
Yeah!
Should I call you a cab?
Tom's wife is Canadian
Tom isn't really Canadian
I wonder what's for supper.
What?
How about dinner?
What's dinner?
All true warriors eat dinner!

I really miss my mom's cooking
Do you know how much it costs?
This is not blue; it is violet
Let's go out for ice cream
I'm trying not to cry
The sky's getting darker
Can you stay for a few days?
I'm dying to know
Is he cute?
Really cute.
How's your dad?
Is Tom aware of what Mary did?
He's a gigolo
Can you feel the difference?
What did you cook for dinner?
Tom didn't do the dishes
Thank God that day's over
I'm a vegan
Do you also do vegan dishes?
Tom didn't open the door
Has Tom calmed down?
Should we force it upon you?
How's your daughter?
Can you play the drums?
Who invented dynamite?
Who was your French teacher?
My children don't speak French
He's a pediatrician
Can you translate this for me?
Can you hold this for me?
Can you carry this for me?
I realized it wasn't for me
He's a twat
I'd love to know that
Now I'll be taking charge here
Tom didn't remember me
When would you like to meet?
Where would you like to meet?
When do you want to meet?
I don't think I was followed
I don't think we were followed
We're Hungarians
Do you feel bored?
So tasty!
I'll eat it later.
Tom, what happened?
Why are you crying?
I don't get modern jazz
Tom didn't say a word to me
Who wants to come with me?
That's the first option
I won't let Tom go to Boston
I wouldn't trust Mary an inch
Does the soup taste good?
I'm against marriage
Don't worry, I'll do it
Whose are these?

God forgives.
Christ is risen!
Indeed He is risen!
Christ is risen!
Truly He is risen!
Shall I add a couple chairs?
Yanni's wife hates him
Don't look through the keyhole
You're a student
Don't translate it
I'll just ignore that
Trust me, I'm fine
Horus, do your job!
I don't want to not do that
Hey, kid
Do you want some candy?
Translate me!
Translate me!
Tom mustn't disturb you
When will Tom be there?
I'm not sure if I will respond
You've got one chance
I'll kill you all
I'll kill all of you
I added Tom's name to the list
Who did it to Tom?
Give me a slice of cake too!
Was my friend British?
I think it's very cute
I haven't got a dime
Why do they hate each other?
What grows here?
Did Tom harass you?
I like them so much!
Don't ever do that again
Understood?
I'm in the United States
Hey, cutie!
Smash the patriarchy!
I think it's in the foyer
Is that a heathen sacrament?
Would you like a cigar?
Would you like to sit with us?
Can you speak Ainu?
Do you speak Ainu?
I can't speak Ainu well
I can't speak Ainu
I don't care if my best sucks
I'm doing it anyway
Show me what you can do!
Do you still watch cartoons?
Are you in the city or not?
He’s such a monster
She’s such a monster
They're looking for work
It's been two days
Tom's eating fruit
That couldn't be avoided
Does she know her brother?
Can you speak more clearly?
That's her ex-husband
There's a piano in the room
Can elephants fly?
Cantonese has 6 to 9 tones
What can I get you to drink?
And for the lady?
I'd like a wheat beer, please.
He doesn't play the piano well
Why?
I don't have my keys.
What keys?
Motorcycle keys.
I'm here waiting for you
The soup is very hot!
Careful!
The soup's hot
It's hot, not cold
Drink the tea while it's hot
Do you like hot chocolate?
They're very clean
It's really clean
Is the air clean here?
It's pure magic
He's peeling an egg
Shut up, stupid
Shut up, stupid!
Caution, wet floor
Horus!
Don’t speak to me ever again
We’re through!
I’m breaking up with you
I didn't do it alone
I saddled the horses, sir
He doesn't look well
Are those buses new?
I'll wait here for him to come
What's new, Vasti?
Just the same old, same old
I'm slacking off at work today
I owe you one!
Tom is a man's man
Hey, neighbor!
No way!
Don't talk to me that way!
It's not that Ali's fat
It's that he's got big bones
I'm a man's man!
Oh, which man's man are you?
Must be a lucky guy.
We're riding on the Internet
Why don't you both just leave?
Has anyone told Tom the truth?
Has Tom been told the truth?
It's on the tip of my tongue!
Do any of us exist?
I hate push-ups
Tom and Mary?
I don't know them
Tom and Mary?
I don't mean to spite you
Tomtown?
Where's that supposed to be?
Maryland?
You're kidding
That's rude
The table's not clean
We didn't take off our shirts
This brandy isn't any good
I need money, not a job
That isn't soft
That's not soft
He's never left Australia
We're glad that we did that
It's written in Dutch
What triggered this?
Yanni didn't show up on time
Yanni didn't get any better
Why do people leave Yanni?
I'm bad at this
They don't believe me!
Enjoy your tea!
When did this start to happen?
What is it Yanni wants to do?
What action did Yanni take?
What was Yanni's reaction?
How does Yanni know Skura?
Come inside, Yanni
Yanni noticed Skura's flaws
It's pure torture
Yanni isn't even aware of that
It wasn't Yanni's fault
Yanni shouldn't blame himself
Yanni's kids are vulnerable
Who is Yanni dating?
Yanni didn't go to that event
Why is Yanni sweating?
Yanni doesn't need that friend
Yanni doesn't need anybody
Yanni left Skura, too
Yanni's cookie is good
We're on autopilot
It's not working, Yanni
Yanni can't survive on his own
That's just Yanni's hypothesis
What triggers this anxiety?
This can help a lot, too
Yanni woke up around 4:00 am
Yanni's hood wasn't safe
Yanni can't stay with Skura
Did you mean to link me that?
Skura is Yanni's birth mom
Yanni was born on April 4th
That's so many people
I'm angry and I'm also tired
I'm angry and also tired
I'm angry and I'm tired, too
We're baking cakes
Did you blush?
It's love
Is the flower real?
Did she say it in Kabyle?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Don't kill it!
It's a house centipede
It eats bugs.
Tom doesn't like this song
You can't mess this up
They're still my children
No, my name isn't Tom
I've never been to California
Who scored the first goal?
What are you doing in my car?
I've never been to Arizona
You should be celebrating!
I'd love some corn
Would you like some corn?
Could you pass the corn?
Corn is a-maize-ing
They know U.S. history well
He isn't sure of himself
He isn't confident
It's me that went to Paris
We're all well
I'm going to buy a hand fan
Didn't you hear anything?
I'm not a computer person
I'm computer illiterate
I'm a Luddite
Why would they tell you that?
Is it true that you're ill?
How messy is your place?
That's one of my best memories
Tom's good at haggling
How did she land that job?
Is that a real place?
What is punk?
Keep on working hard!
Where did she learn Swedish?
You're cute when you sleep
And also when you're awake
You're cute when you sleep
I'm very gay.
I'm in the taxi
I'm in a taxi
I’m studying infinitive verbs
What the hell am I reading?
It seems he's going crazy
I've told you not to do that
I'm going to class
Tom's a bottom
I didn't need to know that
I'm fat and queer
Tom died, but life goes on
What can I teach you?
What can I show you?
What's there to drink?
What do we have to drink?
Do they speak smoothly?
More than you.
Old is good.
I don't study physics
You aren't bothering me
Speak English, please
Speak French, please
In French, please
That wasn't chicken
Please don't adopt me
I won't do it
Don't cry!
I'll buy you a new one
Please don't run
I can't climb that
I'm scared of heights
My name's not Louis
Don't cut this tree down
Don't cut down this tree
Have you ever lived elsewhere?
The window's open now
The one I bought yesterday.
It's tipping it down
How's the cake?
How many books did you borrow?
I'm here every evening
My shoes aren't here
Why are you going to hospital?
But what's the difference?
Can you teach me that trick?
Do you go to Munich often?
Do you often go to Munich?
Do you travel to Munich often?
She's not ready to answer yet
You're basically right
Essentially, you're right
They've changed the lock
Don't trust him
Can I take three?
This is wrong.
You're wrong.
This is stupid.
No, you're stupid.
What floor are you going to?
You bought a new car?
What else could they do?
I'll buy both of them
I'm living in the town
Do you know who she was?
Did you enjoy the match?
I'd like to vote
Are you fishing?
It's high
Did I get robbed?
It's heavy
Who's that?
It's Tom.
Who is this?
It's Tom.
Did Tom say where he is?
I'll tell that to Tom
I believe it's true
I'm glad Tom was caught
I didn't do it!
I'm deathly afraid of reptiles
My bananas are melting!
Let's call each other tomorrow
It's not a lie
It's an alternative truth
There's a river near the house
It's obviously your fault
I'm designing a deck of cards
It's just some advice
What a beautiful landscape!
Such a beautiful picture!
He's a really good boy
I hate being stiff!
Who are we running away from?
Don't be stubborn
You know you're wrong
I'm ready for the adventure
Something is off.
The sun has finally come out!
How did I miss him?
How did I miss it?
How did I let him through?
I'll go to school tomorrow
When can I go to your house?
Someday, you'll be right
How do you mean?
He's too honest to lie
I don't know how it happened
Tom is a lost cause.
He's never going to change.
How dare you?
It's a palliative
You'll become accustomed to it
I wasn't sleeping in class
I think he doesn't care
Or is it?
Sing along!
He's an old buddy
Don't stoop down to his level
It's not worth it
Strike one!
Strike two!
Strike three!
Drink or drive?
You have COVID-19
Which one did you get?
Why doesn't my charger work?
My phone's dying
It's like you worship Tatoeba
Don't kill it!
It's a house centipede
It eats bugs.
Fear me!
Don't worry about anything
G'day, mate
Tom is dead, but life goes on
I'm not a big fan of exams
How do you like the new me?
Eww!
No, never ever!
We didn't take off our shoes
We know it's our own fault
I won't apologise to Tom
Which one did you get?
I got the blue one.
The more expensive pair.
Is the airport far from here?
That isn't something I'd do
How do you say it in Czech?
Tom's too special for that
Tom's too special for that.
Which town is most dangerous?
If you need help, say so
I'm convinced she's not guilty
I was Tom's understudy
You can't turn back time
I'm coughing up a storm
Stop creasing the pages!
It's the lying that gets me
That's against the point
I'm an English learner.
'Sup, dude?
Somebody, come help me
Why does that exist?
They followed the chicken.
You love your wife, don't you?
Where should I put my luggage?
What actually happened here?
I'm afraid of making a mistake
Don't forget that I love you
Don't forget I love you
Yeah, shut up
Who's Bill Gates?
It's too late to do anything
I can't do it anymore!
The '80s called
The '90s called
I don't even finish my..
That isn't very hard to do
Go and see who's there
Tom's off the booze
Hello!
How many of you are there?
He's pouting
Should we go left or right?
It's a draughty house
I buy, therefore I am

That's a false dilemma

Yanni's time will come
No TV for a month.
Fuck!
No TV for a month.

Mom is lying.
Mom is lying?
Don't hurry your words
I'd definitely say so
I didn't answer your question
Do you see the book?
Read the book!
The book's yours
Don't open the book
I'm giving you a book
Did you bring the books?
Here's his book
Read good books!
What color is the book?
Don't envy
May I try it on again?
We aren't young
Did you know that?
Look over there!
Is there any?
I'm of the same opinion as you
I want to be loved, that's all
You're young; you can't retire
I won't be home at nine
Hold on!
I haven't said anything yet
Please don't call me after ten
He didn't beat her
He didn't want to go
I'd like to be rich
He works from 9 to 5:30
Do you drink coffee with milk?
I'm talking to a friend
He doesn't resemble you at all
What did they discover?
And feminism?
Put it away or you'll lose it
Put it away, or you'll lose it
And I'm 16 years old
I'm Tom and she is Mary
Do you have some?
I think you're awesome
What's in a name?
Time to take a bath!
That's a lot of sentences
I got 30.
That's what I got too.
There's no rush
Tom doesn't believe in fate
A woman's weapon is her tongue
He shoots, he scores!
Do you get earaches often?
Do you often have earaches?
Don't you see you're wrong?
It's your civic duty
It won't help you anyway
This car is too expensive!
You haven't read this novel
Where did you buy olives?
Where did Nayla buy a burrito?
Yanni has Alzheimer's
Don't shitpost on Tatoeba

But I didn't do anything!
He's lying!
Is this really French?
Look at what you've done!
It’s not KYC compliant
Tell me, do you ever sleep?
I'd never want to go to Boston
If anyone asks, I wasn't here
You're very lazy
Is he Bhutanese?
Is she Bhutanese?
How could she be so callous?
We're all moved in
I hope you've never done that
Is he Nepalese?
Is she Nepalese?
Tom's car got towed
Are they Nepalese?
He is Sri Lankan, isn't he?
She is Sri Lankan, isn't she?
You can't do that
They're the neutral one
They don't have an army

I did it!
How do I add a sentence?

How hot does it get in Boston?
I'm not sure if I'll respond
Who'll take me to the airport?
I like playing cards.
Me, too.
You might be right there.
The dog's in its kennel
Has Tom got a car?
Has the library got that book?
Has the library got this book?
Do you have this book?
Have you got this book?
I don't mind!
Either one!
They're both fine
Is your name not Tom?
Aren't you called Tom?
No, my name's not Tom
How are you?
I'm fine
You?
I'm fine too.
He's probably your age

That's a bit much to ask
I don't care about you
Let's get this bread
You don't matter to me
I'm bi
I'm in agony!

It's gonna be expensive.
Meaning?
Why did Yanni lie to Skura?
Don't insult my son

Which is?
That's Yanni's problem

How's Yanni's novel coming?
Yanni hurt Skura's feelings
What's your name?
Yanni.
Yanni fixed Skura's seat
Yanni's dad can handle this
Yanni didn't have a chance
Then go and get some!
You know what you're doing
You're just too used to it
You've gotten too used to me
Don't say that you don't
You don't show much these days
Did you go to Rome yesterday?
It's her favorite movie
I don't really like movies
Please close the window!
I'm too tired to go shopping
Darling, please remember
I can't study anymore
I'm way too tired
I've cried so many tears

Great job!

Happy Thanksgiving, Yanni!
That's enough!
You've bitten me!
I'll see you in Japan
Do you have a Mason jar?
Phew, we made it in time
Because it is right there.
It'll be that way
It's going to be like that
And you?
I don't
Do you?

That way.
Tom didn't ask that question
Will you hold this for me?
Where's Tom?
He's over there.
Are you finished with these?
How on earth did you do that?
Would you hold this for me?
Koalas aren't bears
Clear them away, please
What?
You've lost your mobile again?
Ring me after nine o'clock
Phone me after nine o'clock
No, I won't be there
It's enough to drive you mad
Today is 24th May

Who's your best mate?
Could you wait for me a bit?
That's a hare
Here's Tom's book
What time did Tom leave work?
Is that him in the photo?
That's not what Tom wanted
Sounds good!
That's Tom Jackson's father
Am I romantic?
Don't chew gum in class
What was wrong with Yanni?
Yanni couldn't be treated
Yanni's story is inspirational
He was talking Algerian time.
My goodness.
Can you stop pestering me?
It's my own business
What should we do?
Look at you!
Just don't get hurt
I'm actually polyamorous
We're actually polyamorous
It wasn't really that bad
This man, what's his name?
They didn't want Mary to die
They're not together anymore?
They just don't understand
They simply don't understand
Did they say that to her?
Are they far away?
They're my patients
Did you see her fall?
Do you think he'll forgive me?
I told him that I wouldn't go
Would you live on Mars?
That's completely ahistoric

I'll help you
Do you have a day off?
I can't hear well

We're not ready to leave yet
He's at least sixty
I'm glad that Tom was caught
I'm Tom, and she's Mary
She's nearby
She's changed
She's disappointed
I'll never visit Tom again
Is something burning?
It's finally October
Something's making noise
I'm finally home!
Is Mary hiding something?
How's your health?
What's his last name?
What's her last name?
So, how'd it go?
What about today?
How about today?

Close the stadium!
Don't jump over the fence!
Is that fair in your opinion?
She's very rich
One can't always be lucky
I hate glass doors!
I'm jealous of your height.
Really?
That's secondary
Go to sleep, buddy!
You lose!
Good day sir!
Time's up!
Do you like reading?

No, she's not in at the moment
He's out somewhere
She's out somewhere
Tom didn't see anyone
Did you go to Venice?
Have you been to Boston yet?
One more step and you're dead
I'm not Mary's type
I'm coming by bicycle
I'll be coming by bicycle
Do you doubt it?
We've caught Tom
Can you take Monday off?
I can't help feeling jealous
I don't know any Tajik homonym
Which way is the library?
It's that way.
Why is Tom sick?
You don't believe that, right?
Tom doesn't break his promises
Tom doesn't break promises
I've arrived back in Japan
I saw Tom's name on the roster
Let's do a quick recap
Really?
When did that happen?
Ah, I get it
Do you like pineapple pizza?
Do you like Hawaiian pizza?
I don't blame Tom for anything
That was me.
How's our business going?
I want your life blood!
Is Mexico really unsafe?
Tom's popularity has decreased
I've never been to Sapporo
I've been to Sapporo

Surprise, I'm back on Tatoeba!
Why?
Just because.

Is this a pigeon?
I'm dying of curiosity.
Not just curiosity.
Say "welcome" to new users
Do you wish to exit?
That way, you wouldn't exist
Now I'm in Boston
No wonder you're so mad
No wonder you're so angry
Are you leading a double life?
How did you make it?
What's in it?
What's in it?
How did you make it?
No, my name isn't Tom
She doesn't even have one!
A letter can't be a sentence

Don't make such a racket, Tom!
I can't sleep.
I'm washing up.
We've lost our keys
Tom went there, too
We've kept our promises
We're cleaning out our garage
Why does Tom want to see Mary?
That's not my experience
Yanni shouldn't focus on that
Yanni can't share that message
Yanni's hands are sweating
Yanni can't make anything work
Yanni, too, has days like that
Yanni has a low self-esteem
Yanni is overly self-critical
Chaos is Yanni's normal
Yanni doesn't reach to others
Yanni's thoughts are normal
A right to exist doesn't exist

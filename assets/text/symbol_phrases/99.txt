I don't want to get a suntan
I couldn't speak Japanese
I'm never at home on Sundays
I don't go to school on Sunday
I'm leaving on Sunday
I'm not always free on Sundays
I'm only a customer
I don't have a box
I'm a salesperson
I've often seen him bullied
I don't know when he will come
I'm sure of his success
I don't know if he knows it
I don't care what he says
I owe him 100 yen
I don't know if he is a doctor
I don't care for him
I don't like what he said
I didn't notice him go out
I'm thinking he was a kind man
I don't think that he's right
I don't consider him honest
I don't know who he is
I don't know why he was late
I'm sure he will come
I don't enjoy his society
I can't get by without him
I offered him odds of 3 to 1
I don't want him to touch me
I couldn't put up with him
I'll give him a pen
I'll buy a pen for him
I'm attracted to him
I owe him 50,000 yen
I don't want to see him at all
I owe him $100
I can't forget his kindness
He doesn't believe me at all
I don't like the way he speaks
I can't trust such a man as he
I'm looking over his report
Did I hurt his feelings?
I didn't catch what he said
I don't support his ideas
I'm working on his car
I couldn't shake off his hand
I can't answer for his honesty
I haven't met both of his sons
I don't like his rude manner
I don't remember his name
I don't know his name
I don't like the way he talks
I don't trust his story
I'm younger than he is
I don't know either of them
I don't know all of them
I couldn't help admiring him
I don't know him at all
I can't make him out at all
I can't bend him to my will
I can't find fault with him
I'm waiting for him
I can't bear to see her cry
I don't like her
I didn't know that she was ill
I can't make her out
I'd like to go skiing with her
I didn't get along with her
I've known her for a long time
I owe her 100,000 yen
I advised her to come by 9:00
I'll give her some flowers
I'd like to see her
I hope that I'll see her
I said to her, "You look pale
Are you all right?
I'm not acquainted with her
I can't stand her jealousy
I'm immediately behind her
I'm fed up with her complaints
I'm anxious about her health
I'm sick of her excuses
I can't make out what she said
I can't remember her address
I don't know his address
I can't do without her help
I'm tired of her complaints
I'm fed up with her laziness
I don't like her manner
I guessed her to be 40
I don't love her
I can't help loving her
I don't like sad movies
I was tired, so I didn't go
I am not tired.
Neither am I.
I'm really unhappy about this
I don't like traveling by air
I couldn't restrain a smile
I've been on sick leave
I'm poor
I'm all thumbs
I can't help but complain
I'm not satisfied
I've climbed Mt
I've climbed Mt
I've climbed Mt
I've never climbed Mt
I normally get up at 6 o'clock
I'm as tall as my father
I don't take after my father
I took over my father's job
I asked for my father's help
I visited my father's grave
I'm proud of my father
I'm very proud of my father

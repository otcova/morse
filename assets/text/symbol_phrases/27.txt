Tom, is that okay?
That's perfect!
Thanks.
It's because of you!
I can't help blaming you
Is it OK if I go outside?
Do you like children?

Where are you?
Up here in the tree.
That's delicious
Thanks, Mary

We had a cat, not a dog
Good morning, America!
You'll forget about it someday
Is the door open or closed?
He's smarter than she is

That's the school I was at
Wasn't it cold in winter?
At the time, I had no choice
Don't come unless I ask you
It's hard for me to imagine
I don't feel like coming
I don't fancy coming
It's an offer you can't refuse
It's hot
It's hot, so be careful
It's spicy, so be careful
Tom probably won't say yes

Money doesn't score goals
It's a wonderful picture
She doesn't know me nor you
I haven't won yet
Well, did you miss it?
Well, did you miss me?
Poor us!
We've already gone over that
Doesn't she go?
I'm sorry, I don't dance
He doesn't stop shouting at me
I'll visit him in a few weeks
No, I'm not Mary
So, how was that?
I'll follow his advice
You kidding?!
Did she go to bed already?
I don't want to go to jail!
Haven't seen that in a while
Clever sentence!
That's all I am going to say
Look at him!
It's not that obvious

That's too much for Tom
Gunners, prepare to fire
Tom didn't know how Mary felt
I'm not a total fool
Are you free this morning?
That was Tom's mistake
Garlic isn't fruit
Where do you live?
Do you like insects?

Did you fart?
We're all Earthlings
I drink green tea, not black
What color are the boots?
I'm not scared any more
Tom has a one-bedroom flat
Let's practise
She's learning to drive
I'm going to change it

As if you did it!
I don't believe you
Do animals eat oranges?
Say what are you crazy?
Look what you're doing!

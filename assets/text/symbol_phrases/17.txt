Why aren't you going?
I don't want to.
Is Tom with you at the moment?
Yeah, he is
Shall I pass him on to you?
Yes, please.
All right, wait a sec – Tom!
Mary wants to speak to you!
Ah, don't you worry about that
They'll be gone in no time!
I'll sleep on the floor.
Don't be daft!
You'll catch a cold!
If only I'd known
I'm at uni at the moment

Catch me if you can!
How quickly can you write?
Who can show me where Kiev is?

When are you visiting us?
Hello, gentlemen
It's fine if it works
I don't know
Why not?
Isn't it marginalized enough?
What kind of thing is this?
What sort of stuff is this?
There's nothing like Number 9!
It is about 04:20, morning
I don't care about any of this
I'd be happy to.

I've said that all along
Quite right, mate
I'd like to thank Tom
My mind's made up
It's time to go
I haven't the foggiest.
Are you from Timimoun?
I'm from Algiers.
Great!
I'm from Algiers too.

It's really not new
How am I to pay my debts?
How should I pay my debts?

Tom was grief-stricken
I'll use this money carefully
Did I pronounce that right?
I don't know how to act my age
Listen to what I'm saying
Probably it'll snow tomorrow
It'd be so liberating

Who would you say they are?
Are you sure you want to go?
Don't eat during class
Are you sure you want to come?
Are you sure you want to stay?
Are you sure you want to move?
It's up to her
Are you sure you want to help?
That's her decision
Well, that cleared it all up
Don't say anything to him
Is it too hot for you?
Is it too cold for you?
I've seen that somewhere
I'm in a great mood
I've been up for a while
I've been awake for a while
Who was the former prosecutor?
You're a real glutton

Hello Majk!
How intelligent!
Good morning, your excellence!
Everyone get down!
All lies!
Yes, corporal!

Who was Tom fighting?
I work at McDonald's
Don't call here anymore!
How much more is there?
I'll destroy you
Can you spell it out?
He wasn't mistaken
I'd like to call her
Do you have her phone number?
Could you elaborate a bit?
Could you maybe clarify that?
Thanks for coming early!
I'm going to need it again
Just tell him I'm here
He'll definitely be late
He didn't understand you
Did you buy a house?
I won't let you down again
I won't let you down anymore
Do you like solitude?
We're not expecting guests
The food's too cold
No, I don't need anything
Don't worry
She's not coming back
You've still got a chance
I didn't go back to Tazmalt
It's not good
Did she tell them the truth?
We've never had so much snow
Tom ate in his car, as usual
I'm stuck in a dead-end job
You've been asked to leave
So, how'd the date go?
I can't turn it up any louder
That's as loud as it goes
Sorry, I wasn't thinking
There's nowhere to park
Can I borrow some money?
I'll pay you back next week
We don't work on Saturdays
Will she return them?
They're going alone
Nobody's read the book
We haven't told them yet
That's not evidence
If this is a fight, I'm losing
It's not your fault
It's not anybody's fault
What's eating you up?
I don't care what others say
We would've made a good couple
There isn't anywhere to park
Go see what's going on
Go see what's happening
Is it warm enough for you?
I'd love to do more
Don't eat in the classroom
Don't eat in class
I hope Tom wasn't lying
She died at 94
Where did you put my jacket?
We're out of ideas
Is your refrigerator running?
I'm worried now
You won't be easy to forget
You should've got my message
It's so soft!
It's a quarter to eight
It's 7.45
It is 7.45
I've poured you some tea
Did you look in the cupboard?
Didn't he warn you?
Don't you like peppermint tea?
Don't lose sight of him
What do you want to see first?
It's cold and wet outside
Outside, it's cold and wet
Who hasn't got a ticket here?
Let's take another example
That's awfully generous of you
I don't know any Tom
Is that fog?
Are these Adam's children?
He doesn't have a shadow
Great work, Tom!
Did you find us easily?
Do you remember who you are?
Is that a kangaroo?
It probably wasn't her
We'll do without it
I don't feel it anymore
I don't even know where it is
What did you say his name was?
Tell me that I'm right
Want some fish?
Is the fish tasty?
Is the fish good?
Are fish also animals?
Are whales fish?
How's the fish?
Is it good?
This fish isn't fresh
Quiet!
You'll scare the fish away
The phone's dying
Turn off your cell phone!
Who lost their phone?
The phone didn't ring
Whose phone is buzzing?
Give me the phone, Tom
What happened in your dream?
What was in your dream?
Do you join me fishing?
Do you come with me to fish?
What did you hear about him?
What did you hear about her?
I'll try my hand at it
I'll hazard a guess
I'll take a guess
I'll venture a guess
Why in the world are we here?
Tom could've just texted me
I'll pass it along
I'm not an A student
Tom hasn't returned
No one can be 100% objective
When will you fix it?
Where did you eat breakfast?
Where did you eat dinner?
The play wasn't all that bad
I've been away a long time
Are these Tom's children?
It's getting light outside
She doesn't interrupt me
Everybody, clap your hands
I'm a big fan of her kitchen
I've wrapped the presents
Don't you want to answer it?
It's cold as ice!
Can you take me to the cinema?
Have you brought sandwiches?
Do you guys know my father?
Can you lend me your umbrella?
Don't be in a hurry!
Don't be in a hurry, guys!
Do you speak German?
Yes, a little.
Do you remember when we met?
I don't really blame you
I can't drink that much
What else can be true?
I'm a bit slow today
If I were you I'd help her
Don't play with the food
Can we stay just a bit longer?
It won't matter anyhow
Tom, give me the bread
When is the burial?
Does anyone want to try?
We don't care what you do
I'm fed up with your moods
Tom couldn't hear you
I know what you're up to, Tom
Why are you frustrated?
It's been a frustrating week
Could I have some bread?
Tom wasn't distracted
It's only human
Who took you to the hospital?
A five-year old boy can talk
For God's sake, don't call him
You cook too?
Do they know where we live?
The competition begins at 7 pm
Forgot your password?
Where did you find this quote?
So, how's it going with you?
Can I use the computer?
Where did you have breakfast?
That's my handbag
Are you trying to apologise?
Have you read everything?
Have you read it all?
I've never seen her wear jeans
Are you going to the shops?
Did you phone him yesterday?
What's in this room?
What is in this room?
I've got to be on my way now
It wasn't your brother
It's all been worthwhile
It's where things get done
Pretty please, can I have one?
I'm begging you to help me
You're going to be a mom soon
I hope you'll understand
Tom didn't have his glasses on
Tom hasn't said yes yet
Are you foreigners?
Are you foreign?
How can anything survive here?
Shall I show you the city?
Did it seem weird to you?
Did you find it strange?
We're open!
Open these doors!
Is the museum open every day?
It was my father's
Should I open the box?
Who opened the window?
This restaurant's open
They're his adoptive parents
I've got no one else to ask
I haven't taken a shower yet
I haven't showered yet
We'll leave you tomorrow
I'm not allowed to drink wine
I don't travel much
Open the gates!
Close the gates!
What do they want to know?
She's wearing a strange hat
He's wearing a strange hat
Was that truly necessary?
Tom could've hurt Mary
That's yet to be decided
Is this mushroom poisonous?
Can I eat this plant?
Ah, I get it
Small reptiles are so cute!
Whoa, weird!
Whoa, that's weird!
The whole world's going crazy
I've just found the problem
I believe you'll pass the exam
Promise me you'll do your best
I'm sure you'll pass the exam
I'll be there for three weeks
Do you cook, too?
Do you also cook?
Let's go steady
It's a knotty issue
It's a knotty problem
I haven't had a shower yet
We might need Tom's help
They're going to the concert
You're going to the concert
We're going to the concert
Mary's going to the concert
She's going to the concert
Tom's going to the concert
Is he here?
Of course he is.
I didn't want to assume.
I'm going to the concert
Tom doesn't have any patience
Tom's got no patience
Tom hasn't got any patience
That's a shadow
I've got his telephone number
Don't ask me, mate
I haven't got a clue
Where's Tom?
Don't ask me, mate
I haven't got a clue.
I'm watching a new film
Same again, please
What are you doing?" he asked
I don't want to talk now
I'm tired
He doesn't want to see me
Let's ring Tom and Mary
Let's phone Tom and Mary
It's about your future
I'm in the football team
Who do you think you are?
My wife?
Did you have a nice holiday?
Have you got any candles?
He's brimming with enthusiasm
He's bursting with enthusiasm
Will you do that for me now?
Just not today, okay?
I'm sitting in the third row
Why is it so expensive?
Why does it cost so much?
Why's it so expensive?
I'd like a replacement
How are you doing?
Not too shabby.
Please don't come here again
Do you celebrate Christmas?
I think Tom's on drugs
You're my family
Don't slam the door, please
Who is more popular?
What the hell is he doing?
Don't you know I love you?
We've got to get this fixed
Let's see how this plays out
Can I get advice?
Is it possible to get advice?
It's da bomb, yo!
I won't serve Tom anymore
I never would've imagined it
I'll have what she's having
Did you check the mailbox?
This isn't the only condition
I'm sick of Boston
Don't blame them for it
He hit me, but it didn't hurt
Who would forbid such a thing?
My husband passed away in 2017
Now I'm ready to go
I've got to rush
I've got to hurry
It's not making any noise
The light's too dim
Guess I'll never know
What movies did he direct?
I think it's in the basement
What do you keep in the attic?
I like home-style cooking
They're trying to get pregnant
They're trying to have a baby
Aww, you're too kind.
I like watching men's soccer
Mexico.
Mexico.
Our school was founded in 1951
Good thing you came!
Improve your Arabic in 30 days
Tell me, why are you here?
I haven't done much recently
I will wait 123 years for you
I'm prepared to defend myself
We're rooting for you
Resistance is futile!
Yes, I want to!
Yes, I want it!
Mary, be careful
I'll bring you some water
Try them on!
Don't you know what it means?
Mom, look what I can do!
I'll give you a bike
Can you behave yourself?
Did you count me?
It's a fictional place
I don't want to go to the cafe
Help!
It's too personal a question
Would you do a favor for me?
That'd never happen
You're leaving?
Was I supposed to know that?
You ran away?
Vegetables can't talk
Can you stop complaining?
What can I do here?
Is it always so hot here?
Is it always this hot here?
I'm pretty skint at the moment
How did you get into my flat?
A year later, Paul was born
As far as I know, he's single
Can you come and pick me up?
Today is Tuesday, 17 December
Have you replied to them?
Did you reply to them?
It's a weight off my mind
Why have you dragged us here?
I'd like to know that as well
Have you got a minute?
We're studying for the exams
We're revising for the exams
We're going to the station
We're going to the seaside
Shall we meet up on Saturday?
I'd like some bread and jam
What good does it do?
So, how did your date go?
What exactly do we need to do?
What exactly should we do?
Tom couldn't do otherwise
Please don't do anything today
What Tom did wasn't legal
I don't care what you've heard
I admit you're right
Now I'm seeing a friend
What does a plumber do?
They don't have children
No, that's not what I wanted!
Do you want to start over?
Where are my hands?
Where are my arms?
Do you eat at home?
Do you know her number?
I've made up my mind to stay
Are you parked far away?
Why should I not do this?
She's on the run
My wife's father has dark hair
Everything has to go!
My father-in-law has dark hair
That's not surprising, is it?
Die, insect!
Are you a doctor or something?
Do you have your flashlight?
Are you two not brothers?
It's a masonic conspiracy!
You're actually right
Did you get scratched?
Who will be the first to go?
Tom was upset, too
We won't tell Mom
What should I bring you?
It doesn't work well
It's a shame, though
How about a steam bath?
There is no time.
How can we help?
Hmm..
You're fucked.
Oah!
Link, save me!
I'll be rich someday
Don't you know how to do that?
There's an accident ahead
I don't know who to believe
What is it?
Get rid of it!
I'll put it outside.
Don't worry
It's not loaded
Oh, he's so cute!
Can I pet him?
That's bound to take a while
It's bound to take a while
Don't forget to ring
Don't forget to phone
It doesn't seem too difficult
For!" yelled Mary immediately
Tom's not in the library
Tom hasn't shown up
Nan's cooking is the best
Look out of the window!
Tom wouldn't let me finish
Tom didn't let me finish
Have you heard the rumour?
What's he doing here again?
I think he's about to tell us.
Where's Tom?
There he goes!
The coat is not bad, I like it
Where are you?
Here!
Listen to what she's saying
I won't stay for long
Tom couldn't bear the heat
That's the way it seemed
Tom has Mary's money
I know that it's true
Where are you going to go now?
I know you're not satisfied
You're a typical Westerner
It must've been raining
Tom couldn't speak at all
They're learning English
Who teaches Mary English?
Should I answer in English?
I don't know English well
Don't even think of that
We're not rich or anything
Is it a false impression?
Maybe, there are reasons
Tom could hear Mary's voice
I've only got you left
You're all I have left
Who am I to judge?
I can't say no to her
We're not all that different
I'm never home alone
Mary doesn't vote
Don't be blind
Wealth isn't just money
Money isn't everything
Should I wake you up tomorrow?
Who else is in favor?
Do you agree?
I won't be needing it anymore
Could you dumb it down a bit?
Could you speak up?
What you're saying is so true
What you're saying isn't true
What you're saying is untrue
What you're saying is wrong
Won't you help me?
Tom couldn't revive Mary
Let's see if we get approval
Tom couldn't have known that
I really think you're great
Tom couldn't bear the pain
How dare you call me a racist!
How dare you hit me!
Do you have anywhere to go?
Have you got anywhere to go?
Don't eat it while it's hot
This is my mother-in-law
About a fortnight.
When did you buy this yoghurt?
Why?
But you can still eat it.
Can I have it?
He's brilliant at maths
I'll take you to my place.
It's not in the dictionary
I've still got my vinyl
I've still got my records
He was really good-looking
What a beautiful vase!
Do you know how it's spelled?
Have you seen her new video?
Who can answer the question?

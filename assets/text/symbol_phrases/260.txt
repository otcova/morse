Will you sing?
Tom said Mary didn't win
We won't sing
Tom might've won
Tom knows Mary won't win
We don't sing
Tom knows Mary can't win
Should I sing?
Let's eat now
It wasn't big
Tom hopes Mary won't win
Tom hopes Mary won't cry
Is that paper?
I'd love that
Tom wasn't kind to Mary
Tom told Mary he'd wait
Tom doesn't swim
Tom doesn't sing
Tom didn't drive
Tom says Mary can't win
Tom wasn't well
Did you study?
Tom wasn't safe
Did you smile?
Tom wasn't rude
Tom wasn't neat
Tom wasn't mean
Today's cold
Tom wasn't lazy
Tom said Mary can't win
Tom wasn't fair
Tom wasn't done
Let's buy it
It isn't big
I've read it
I won't sing
Tom must've won
Tom didn't let Mary win
Tom wouldn't help Mary
Tom won't let Mary win
Tom isn't upset
Tom isn't tired
I didn't run
Tom wasn't mad at Mary
Tom wasn't Mary's type
Can you sing?
Tom told Mary he'd win
Who'll sing?
Tom won't wait
We'll leave
Tom wasn't wet
Tom wasn't shy
Tom wasn't mad
May I leave?
Tom wasn't bad
It's pretty
It's famous
Mary's eyes are pretty
Is it spicy?
Is it cheap?
Is it black?
I'd do that
Do you sing?
Did you run?
Can we swim?
Can we sing?
Can I leave?
Tom won't cry
May I swim?
Tom wasn't OK
May I sing?
Let's rest
I'll write
Tom isn't wet
Can I sing?
Let's ski
Tom died, not Mary
Is it big?
DNA doesn't lie
Sami swore he didn't do that
Let's bunk off class
Tom isn't a caretaker
Where's the tube station?
Where's the metro station?
Which do you care to use?
How much money have you?
Are you taking the piss?
Can't you even do that right?
Did you give Tom the key?
Can I kiss him goodbye?
Use your key.
My key doesn't work.
He's family
Sami's motorbike is brand new
Sami enjoyed Layla's company
Was Sami married to Layla?
Is your mother still in jail.
My mother is not in jail.
Oh, I'm glad she has got out.
Does this story hold water?
Is the boy worthy of praise?
I see your father's garden
But what about the dishes?
I'll take care of them later.
Sami's parents called it quits
Sami's world crumbled
Sami's parents weren't happy
Was it you who did it?
What is in the basin?
What did you say?
Latin is not as hard as Greek.
What did you say?
What animal do you see?
What is quantum cryptography?
What is the use of philosophy?
Does Maria not owe you?
Has somebody called me?
Reptiles are cold-blooded
Some things can't be rushed
Oh my God, you look good!
Tom's parents often fight
What is philosophy's point?
What's this strange music?
Sami is aware of Layla's past
Yes," he admitted
May I have your name, sir?
It fits perfectly..
Well, almost perfectly
When is the baby due?
What about the neighbors?
Mary is 9 months pregnant
Can't you forgive me?
No, Tom
Do you speak Lithuanian?
That's a challenging question
I got fired.
Are you serious?
I got fired.
Again?!
You're worthless.
How's everything, people?
Who is going to believe that?
Sami can't change that
She's a stripper, Sami
I'm not involved in this
I won't forgive you for this
Don't erase the board
It's just water
How is Sami doing over there?
Don't take that seriously
If something happens, call me
I'm not good at handling this
I dare you tell me that?
I don't need to explain this
You can't leave me here
I promise I won't let you down
I'll give it a try, at least
Do you like the gift?
What was in that box?
I left Sami's house at six
That's a strategy they use
Was the car stolen?
I didn't know it was a gift
It's all for you
I'll be outside to do my work
I'm just taking a shower
Where did you hide the box?
Can we be friends now?
Sami took the CD's and left
Why is that woman screaming?
I'll make the decision alone
Can you explain this to us?
I'm not available for anyone
May I offer you any help?
You'll never change, Sami
This soup is delicious.
I agree with you.
Why are you so cruel to Sami?
But she will find out anyway.
It's a long story.
Yeah, a long and boring story.
You'll pay for this
You're as honest as your mom
To me, my mom was wonderful
Don't be so sad
Sami is missing.
Don't tell me.
You're such a genius
I'll pay you.
I'm not doing this for money.
Don't talk about the past
It's just terrible
I can't even wash my face
I've had a bad day
Don't ask stupid questions
Tom's dead as a doornail
You can't reanimate the dead
Why did you get suspended?
I shouldn't mourn
I'm calling an ambulance
Don't even text me
Tomato, tomato
Layla's baby was due June, 6th
We're having an affair
Go ahead.
Sami didn't want that child
What is your salary?
Tom, don't fidget
Stop squirming, sit still!
Where are you from?
I'm from Paris.
Was it a biological weapon?
Never, never, never give up
Whoa, wait a second there
He's an old hand
He's a johnny-come-lately
I'm not that daft
That's a first
Tom looks half-cut
Have you already dressed?
Is she a demon?
No, a cow.
It's my first weekend home
Tom, my feet are freezing
Please get me my slippers!
Tom's back again.
Worse luck.
I don't know that girl's name
Sami's cancer was in remission
Sami didn't have cancer at all
What's your number again?
I can't stay longer
Why don't you stop smoking?
So, what's new?
Are we already going?
What's the best solution?
Tomorrow I'll be in Skopje
I know you're cheating on me
It's not that unusual
Does your husband beat you?
Come on, guys!
What's that black eye?
Did Sami beat you again?
What's that black eye?
It's nothing, really.
Did Sami beat you again?
We were stopping passers-by
He was stopping passers-by
She was stopping passers-by
I was stopping passers-by
They were stopping passers-by
Mary was stopping passers-by
Tom was stopping passers-by
Can I meet you?
You're going straight to hell
I'm a sinner, too
Will God forgive us?
I've sinned
Please don't shoot me
I've told you what I know
It's the truth
I'm not cheating on you
Layla stole Sami's attention
That's ridiculous.
Sami's alibi was pretty solid
Sami's alibi seemed airtight
What's on top of the mountain?
When did you learn to read?
It's too sunny
We can't climb that mountain
It's too high
This dress fits like a glove!
You've disappointed me a lot
Mary is very slim, almost lean
They don't need to wait
They don't need to hurry
They don't have to hurry
They don't need to worry
What's everyone talking about?
I can't wait until tomorrow
I'm so excited!
Can it wait until tomorrow?
Do you have jumper cables?
What did you do about it?
How quickly can we get there?
I'll bring you a towel
Did you see anything unusual?
I'm ready to pay for that
Are you OK with that?
I'm interested in you
Sami's wife is gonna find out
Can you learn to eat properly?
That's the truth
Who is going to clean this?
That's enough laughing
It didn't happen like that
I swear I'll make it right
I'll take a long warm bath
I'll wait for you in the room
I can't have dinner with you
Who ordered this pizza?
I've never met my mother
I must pretend what I'm not
That's the Sami I know
Is this what I ordered?
Why did Sami abandon me?
I'm not very hungry
Yes, I've realized that.
Is Layla ugly.
But she's a bit fat.
I didn't ask for ice cream
You order and I obey, baby
Who's knocking?
It's my husband!
I don't want to go to hell
Sami shot his wife's lover
I'm tired of this stupidity
I feel I can't breathe
What's Sami doing up there?
Don't be such a killjoy
We're home now
Sami was reading Layla's diary
Who's sleeping here?
Why is Layla here?
Think hard, Sami
Should I try to wake Sami up?
Why are you up there?
Why are you so noisy?
I'm just asking you
Are you not going to tell me?
You must be Sami's mother
Who will believe us now?
I can't believe it
We slept together?
We slept together?
Thank God you're awake now
Why did you do that?
Do you want to die?
You're just a spoilt brat
I think that won't help
Are you feeling depressed?
Let's go to a massage parlor
Don't touch me
Why don't you try this hat?
What kind of music is this?
Have you seen your sister?
Can I show you something?
Sure.
You haven't learned, have you?
Are you travelling together?
It's an action film
It's a Japanese film
How old is your little sister?
Sorry, but I don't understand
It was about time you arrived!
That's wishful thinking
That's a banana
Oh, look!
A shooting star!
That's Cassiopeia
That's Orion's sword
Was it all just a lie?
Why am I not losing weight?
How is it in Japan?
How is it done in Japan?
Don't be afraid
Your dad isn't here
You're on your way to hell
Sami couldn't think anymore
Sami is doing the Lord's work
Sami moved to Toronto, Ontario
We've got to stop this
We had Sami's agreement
Layla's husband was military
I didn't know who that was
What happened at the club?
What's the surprise?
It's not a madhouse
Is that gift for me?
Let me go or I'll scream
I'm tired of seeing your faces
You're crossing the line here!
Shall we dance?
Oh, no
I don't know how to dance.
I can't even count on you
I'm gonna break Sami's face
Does this make you feel good?
Here is your coffee.
I don't want it anymore.
Sami slept at Layla's house
Mr. Bakir is waiting for me
I'll take you to your house
I'm bringing you back here
Sami left Layla's room
You can't buy intelligence
Sami's house was a hell hole
Sami is Layla's sole heir
Sami claimed Layla's house
The pleasure is all mine.
I'll give you a massage
I'm doing Sami a favor
Sami's brother is gay
Someone stop the fight!
Where could Sami be?
I'll throw you in jail
Sami isn't joking
What happened to my computer?
What happened to my son?
Will Sami survive?
Sami.
Yes.
I love you, too.
How did you find out about it?
Who was driving?
Please don't press charges
You're my pretty sweetheart
I'd go nuts if we stay here
It's an old recipe
We're leaving
I think I'm gonna faint
I'll always be here with you
Sami had a nap in Layla's room
Don't dare cross me!
It's totally unfair
Those children are also Sami's
Sami hasn't left Layla's side
Sami sounds like a king's name
Sami, such a beautiful name
Sami doesn't love anyone
Is that true, love?
Don't you be so rude
Chess, that's my passion
Layla wanted to find Mr. Right
Sami's fortune improved
Layla wasn't my type
You can't ignore the obvious
Sami's death was no accident
Sami couldn't prove his alibi
I don't have sympathy for Sami
Was it a robbery gone wrong?
Layla's jewellery was missing
Sami's alibi was rock-solid
You're going to regret it
How sweet you are, darling
You're the best friend ever
I didn't see him anymore
We're living in Sami's house
Don't be foolish, sweetheart
Did Sami eat all the soup?
Imagine if that news gets out?
You're fired, insolent fool
This can't be my check
Leave this room now.
Excuse me?
I said leave this room.
Bring me a cup of coffee.
I beg your pardon?
I want a cup of coffee.
What time is it?
Pardon me?
Are you deaf?
What time is it?
I'll fire you both
You're suspended
You're like an addiction
Make me feel that I'm yours
I've loved you from day one
Leave my office right now.
Sami doesn't easily give up
Do you want some peaches?
Don't you walk out on me
Did you dry your hair?
Death is but a moment, too!
You've got a leaf in your hair
Don't ask me how it works
Tom likes "B" movies
I'm not a big fan
I'm not a big fan of Tom
I'm not a big fan of his
You're really brave
Please don't throw up here
Are you going to break my arm?
The one who's unfair is you
Hi tech, big wreck
Let's settle this like men
Sami was born in Waco, Texas
Sami's past quickly caught up
Sami earns a six-figure salary
Sami's grades dropped
Sami had a 16-year-old sister
Sami was Farid's new associate
The gang became Sami's family
I'm more confused than you
Don't you try to confuse me
Can Sami get a gun for us?
Sami can't lie very well
Sami set Layla's body on fire
Don't start with this again
Did you bite your tongue?
Sami's family has come to town
Sami doesn't know how to fight
Sami didn't divorce Layla
Don't you dare touch me
Let's have a drink.
I don't want a drink with you.
I'm sick of these arguments
It's over when I say it's over
Don't be too confident
Layla is a spoilt daddy's girl
How much does Sami owe you?
Sami had an iron-clad alibi
Sami's plan was his downfall
I can't act on TV again
That's what made Sami happy
I don't want Sami here
Finding Sami isn't hard
Please take me home.
You heard the man.
Please take me to my room.
You heard the lady.
Sami ruined Layla's reputation
Sami's mission was complete
Sami's reputation was ruined
That was Sami's view
Sami took Layla's virginity
Layla fell for Sami's charms
I'm tired of your stupidity
You can say that again, Sami.
Hail Caesar!
It's not hard for everybody
It's sad to see Tom so unhappy
It's getting dark
Justice doesn't always prevail
Sami drove to Layla's home
Sami took Layla's money
Lucky you!
'Of course!'
Remember, don't give up easily
The coffee-house is closed
The café is closed
The butcher's shop is open
The baker's is open
Who is in the living room?
Who is in the sitting room?
Who is in the lounge?
Tom eats out of Mary's hand
Tom eats from Mary's hand
We'll definitely invite Tom
Who's in the living room?
What's your favorite painting?
I'm afraid of needles
Are you happy with me?
Immensely happy.
I can't promise you
Don't ask me why I did it
I've got tired of your lies
Are you losing your head?
Police couldn't get any leads
I'm making a fruit salad
What's all the noise about?
I'll take a break tomorrow
This grave is your new home.
What do you mean?
What's written in the letter?
You're not obliged to do so
Sami's house is burning
You can't choose your parents
We're late.
I know.
I'm busy.
Busy doing what?
I was busy.
Busy doing what?
Everybody hide!
Tom, we'll be late!
Shut up, Tom
No one asked you!
Don't be so daft
I told you to knock!
You really don't know?
Why didn't he message me?
Choose Philippines!
What does the letter say?
Why is Sami at the hospital?
Sami trying to kill himself?
It's just nonsense
Was Layla your girlfriend?
Can you take me back home?
Not even to Granpa?
How on earth is this possible?
Is this what you all want?
You wanna know something?
How are my girls?
Are you staying for lunch?
What is it like to be in love?
Does it feel good?
I'm not prepared to forget it
I'll be going home soon
I don't like what's going on.
Neither do I.
This isn't the way home
Did you really think I forgot?
This doesn't look like Cairo
Why don't you just sit there?
Did you have an argument?
Did you two have an argument?
Shall I serve you?
Yes, please.
Who did you see there?
You're dressed like a whore
Can I help you for anything?
Are you in charge here?
No.
Who is in charge then?
It shouldn't take too long
We'll drop by later
I'd like to do it with you
I'm falling in love
Do you think I'm exaggerating?
You're already pregnant
Sami doesn't want me
What if Sami knows about that?
You don't even look at me
Did you go out with Sami?
What was it like?
This problem can't be ignored
Even when he steals cars?
Coud I have some water?
I can't even swallow
If you need me, just call me
Love isn't pity
I'm home, resting
You again?
Yeah, it's me again.
I'm at the reception
I didn't charge Sami a penny
Hold on, I'm coming!
Would you mind leaving?
I'd like to dress
Can I have the top bunk?
Ah, to be young again
Would you mind leaving us?
Would you mind leaving us?
Everyone, out of the water!
That's not what I wanted hear
It's not what I had in mind
You've ruined it!
You've ruined it!
You've ruined everything!
Can you show me around?
He told me that he loved me.
He told me the same thing!
Are you working tonight?
That's not what I wanted to do
I'm sorry, Sir
You were saying?
I don't have a handkerchief
Am I interrupting anything?
Oh no, come in, please.
Where are we going?
You're changing the subject.
What was the subject?
Can I talk to you?
Lily.
Pardon?
My friends call me Lily.
How come you're so late?
Are you reading a book?
Let's take a look at the book
Where did you meet such a guy?
Hallelujah!
You're not pregnant
You're just a bunch of cowards
Did Sami give you my message?
Why won't you trust me?
I'm your wife, aren't I?
You didn't tell me that
You'll need to go on a diet
Come on, you can't be serious
What's the time?
Hi, Sami
How's things?
What's the time, Sami?
We're here to help Sami
Sami won't appreciate it
Sami doesn't look too well
What did Sami say about me?
Is that Sami Bakir's office?
Is that Sami?
Who's calling, please?
Layla is Sami's private nurse
Layla gave Sami's flowers away
Here's your tea.
Thank you.
See you.
Yes, see you later.
Come on, eat some
Sami's check is ready
Sami can't do anything right
Sami's accounts are frozen
Can I do anything?
No, it's OK
I'll clean it up.
I don't follow
What are you talking about?
I'm so sorry
Forgive me.
What do I have to forgive?
Of course I don't think that
If you like, I'd listen to you
I'm listening
I can explain.
Well, explain then.
I'm listening
Bakir is Layla's maiden name
I didn't tell Sami any of this
Do you have the address?
How silly of me!
I don't mind this.
Well, I do mind!
I don't dispute the facts
Don't get me wrong here
Do you believe in God?
Of course I do.
First of all, stop screaming
Is that quite clear?
Pardon?
Does he move his head?
What do you want?
Two kilos of potatoes, please.
Safety first!
Let's wait!
Am I wrong?
You're absolutely right.
She's having a baby
How can Sami be so sure?
Sami will come when he's ready
Sami's company was in the red
Leave her alone.
Say that again, little fag?
I'm gonna break your face.
I didn't insult you, asshole
Something to drink?
No, thank you.
The baby is Sami's
What if the baby is mine?
Did I or did I not help you?
That's two of us, Layla.
I'm gonna stay where I belong
Who's the other woman?
Does she have a name?
They're not whores
Let me explain.
You were dating that whore?
She's not a whore
Please, Layla, let me explain.
I'm leaving!
Shut up, you moron!
Why did you let me sleep?
I know I'm not a child anymore
Where is Sami?
Are you all deaf?
It's really late
Breakfast before you go?
No, I'm already late.
How about coffee?
OK.
Sami won't talk
Sami doesn't want to talk now
Sami doesn't remember much
Sami didn't touch Layla
Sami beat me.
That little asshole.
Sami didn't let me talk
Sami took Layla's suitcase
Sami's life is over
Sami won't stay long
Sami didn't want Layla
Sami found Layla's necklace
Sami needed Layla's help
Sami can't tell Layla anything
Sami didn't even know Layla
Sami didn't hurt Layla
Sami didn't tell the police
Sami hasn't even started
Sami can't let Layla do this
Sami's store was closed
Sami isn't leaving today
Sami is Layla's only love
Sami won't show up here again
Sami shouldn't do it that way
Sami will like Layla's soup
He's in room six
I'm sorry, Sami
Ah!
Don't say you agree with me
Tom has a 3D TV
Why didn't you buy coffee?
Sami can't sell his shares
Sami doesn't get much rest
Sami doesn't want to argue
Sami and Layla don't go along
Sami won't forget that
Sami doesn't have any family
There's a stain on my T-shirt
He doesn't love us
I've got a stain on my T-shirt
Tom doesn't want one
One day you'll get there
Do you eat rice?
Do you like orchids?
Tom doesn't have a rice cooker
Do you like quinoa?
Didn't you hear?
Sami doesn't care anymore
Sami won't find out
Are you coming tomorrow?
I've traveled all over Russia
What's your new friend called?
He's read the book
Isn't it against the rules?
He didn't like going to school
You're famous!
Sami is Layla's only brother
Sami is Layla's second husband
Sami isn't worth it
Sami didn't flaunt any subject
I'm losing my teeth
I'm dying by bits
I'm drinking sage tea
Did you put sage in the pasta?
Is sage medicinal?
There's no need to insist
Has anyone guessed?
Don't get cocky
Tom's mother cried a little
Where's Malta?
Sami's a waiter at a gay bar
What time do we meet up there?
Tom's goldfish is depressed
I have 3 girlfriends
We've had a lot of rain
May I go out for a minute?
Don't trust Sami too much
Behave yourself, will you?
Show a little courtesy!
I'd like you to go away
OK, you're free to go home
I can't fix the engine
Have you got any free time?
The party's in full swing
She's always crying
Tell me why she's crying
I don't wanna lose you
Hello, I'm talking to you.
Sorry?
Won't you give me a chance?
I'm expecting a baby
Be careful!
My dog bites!
Yes, but it's so hot!
Would you like a drink?
Oh yes, that's a great idea.
Tell me, how old are you?
It's not too late
When are we stopping?
When does your train arrive?
Thank you so much!
You're so nice.
It's no problem.
There's no train this morning
Your schedule, is it too full?
Where has Will gone?
I'd rather sit on the floor
Did you want to buy that book?
Mary stopped working at 5 pm
What is the best solution?
Are you polyamorous?
I have 3 boyfriends
We can't talk here
Could I talk to you alone?
We're barely getting by
You OK, Pete?
He's totally into you too
What are you doing?
Don't call him over here!
What are you doing?
Don't call her over here
Mary massaged Tom's temples
I'm not arrogant
He's fun to hang out with
He's fun to hang out with
She's fun to hang out with
You're an idiot.
I know.
Two tickets, please
I like fast-paced movies
I'm sorry... for everything
What was that again?
I don't want to talk to you
He's too weak to talk
She's too weak to talk
I know you're intelligent
I don't want arguments here
It's shaking again
Did he get home at six?
Kilimanjaro?
Is that red or white?
You still love me, Layla
Don't lie to me..
This baby is Sami's
Let's go far.
How far away?
Feel my kisses, darling
Do you have a happy marriage?
You're having a child
You're having a baby
I'll make them pay
Are you still mad about Sami?
Are you insulting me?
Where is the prophet's tomb?
What is tomorrow's date?
I can't do it!
I cannot do it!
It is a Finno-Ugric language
What he's saying is true
I don't know the secret code
Do you want some mulled wine?
What a coincidence!
We're wearing the same tie
What a coincidence!
Did you find her address?
What are you cooking for us?
Now we're expecting a child
Why don't you move in here?
Don't close the gate
That's it, you jerk, leave!
Is this your baby?
Shut up and listen to me!
I'll move in
When I touch you, you tremble
You're blameless
That's funny," said Tom
You have your mother's eyes
I can't find my mobile
I can't find my phone
I don't have time for chitchat
This isn't about you
Tom's father was a drunkard
What is that on your t-shirt?
There's a spot on your shirt
Tom's strategy paid off
I promise you won't regret it
Tom hasn't beaten us yet
She hasn't beaten us yet
Tom was a one-hit wonder
Then why did you run?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Then why did you run?
What the fuck is this shit?
I can see that you're all here
I'm extremely mad right now
You're pregnant
I'm not asking that of you
Oh yeah?
I hate you!
And I hate you more!
I'm starting to dislike this
Should I tell Sami everything?
Sami's shift isn't over yet
Sami hasn't left yet
He's my everything
Sami didn't call in to explain
Sami won't be coming back
Sami wouldn't like that
Sami doesn't like it here
Sami shouldn't have come
Sami isn't from our school
Sami is Layla's new admirer
Sami can't come with us
Sami isn't allowed in here
Sami can't see you today
Sami can't see Layla today
Sami isn't that old
Sami didn't want to get fired
Sami can't doubt that
Sami didn't know the truth
Sami's father died in 2006
Sami can't hold Layla back
Sami won't be back today
Did she touch your breasts?
I'm anxious to see your stuff
I think that's just cruel
But hey, you be the judge
In love, who doubts accuses
I'm not a mind reader
This is yesterday's newspaper
Have your clothes dried?
Would you like some hot tea?

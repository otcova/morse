I'm sure Tom will help us
Oh, no matter
What's your preference?
Well, then, I'll drive
I understand why you're upset
I don't let my kids watch TV
By the way, where is Tom?
Tom wasn't there today
I love Fridays!
Who is Marika?
I don't produce their films
Let's sing that English song
What can I do for you, honey?
Where do you keep the booze?
She's really good
I have to do what's right
Tom, I know you're in there
Did she laugh at you?
Did he laugh at you?
We need to talk, honey
I find that hard to believe.
Look at what he's wearing!
Look at what she's wearing!
No, my love
Yes, my love
Did anyone see you?
No.
Why is this so expensive?
Do you have any secrets?
It's a privilege, not a right
This isn't a place for kids
Guess what?
I'll sleep on the futon
It is a multi-stage process
However, he is happy
I don't speak Portuguese
Are you sure?
Why not?
I haven't spoken to him since
We must consume less!
Are you a supermodel?
You don't accept gifts
Can I take a picture of you?
Can I take your picture?
We're sharpening the knives
That's an old wives' tale
A blind man can't play cards
You won't regret this
Have you lost your ticket?
I don't want a big wedding
Writing doesn't interest me
I want to read, not write
Do you think it will fit?
Are all of them your friends?
She's not his girlfriend?
He's not your boyfriend?
Let's make love
Do I know you?
Mom, Tom won't share with me!
Work isn't shameful
It's an old picture
Tom, tell me the truth
Let's let the boy try
Don't stay here
I think you're in my seat
What time are you coming?
Where do we go after we die?
I've lost hope
It doesn't sound natural to me
Hail and farewell, brother
It's dangerous by the rocks
That's just what I said
We've been robbed
These aren't real
Tom yanked Mary's ponytail
Tom thinks he's figured it out
I'll take Tom with me, OK?
We've got everything we need
Tom wasn't here this morning
Tom wouldn't take the money
Tom wouldn't change his mind
I'm watching television
I'd like a glass of milk
Too good to be true, eh?
Perhaps you'd better leave
Have you found the leak?
Tom showed up 30 minutes late
I'm butthurt
I didn't say you took it
Let's find out who he is
Tom wasn't here when I came in
Are you really a princess?
That's just your imagination
Somebody's going to get hurt
Why were you in such a hurry?
I'm not stealing it
I'm just taking it back
Come on, Tom
Let's go home
Tom was here, wasn't he?
Tom was right, wasn't he?
We're the only guys here
I didn't expect you to be here
I'd like a glass of whole milk
Waitress!
Wait, what the fuck?
I'm talking to her on Facebook
Tom, I'm bored
I'm bored
Let's do something
I'm so bored right now
Let's do something
Don't ask questions
Tom, I'm bored
Let's do something fun
Want to do something fun?
Want to do something boring?
Tom used to be good-looking
I'm not as smart as you
You're not as smart as me
Don't worry
I'm good at this
Look what I've found
I didn't decorate it
Not all that glitters, is gold
If the cap fits, wear it
I will not give up!
I am a giant!
Nobody wants to drink?
What would Brian Boitano do?
We've looked everywhere
Calm down, Tom
Don't get ahead of yourself
Even my parents don't like me
Mary doesn't understand that
Perhaps you'd better drive
Tom sweats when he's stressed
I can't get the lid off
I didn't unlock that door
Let's find out what Tom did
I'm younger than I look
Excuse me, but this is my seat
This is self-explanatory
I'll leave you tomorrow
The woman's name is Sue
The lady's name is Sue
Pretty good.
Thanks for rubbing it in.
Why did Tom change?
He's all by himself
I was hoping you'd come back
Tom still hasn't come back
That is my mom's computer
Happy Independence Day!
Tom won't trouble us again
Don't smoke
Perhaps it's just about sex
Tom waited for Mary until 2:30
Tom won't be back till 2:30
Tom will arrive at around 2:30
Has Tom ever kissed you?
I've got a message for you
Have they found Tom yet?
Has Tom figured it out yet?
Has Tom found his keys yet?
Have you tried it yet?
I'm not boycotting you
Long live Farsi!

Have you ever heard Tom sing?
That's broken
Is Tom stupid?
Is this Tom's?
I wonder if that's Tom
Has Tom returned?
It's a joke
She's a fox
Face it, Tom, Mary was right
Everything'll be all right
Is everybody all right?
That's a complex question
I'm very scared
Face it, Tom, it's over
Do you love each other?
Look, Tom, it's going to be OK
How do you feel about Tom now?
Don't try to be a hero now

You're on the home page
She's over her head

It's a huge mistake

Can you spare a few minutes?
Can we see you a minute?

What kind of job did Tom get?
Tom's a crack shot

It is on the table.

I'd like to go riding
It's none of his business
You can't get both

Do you do any volunteer work?
Is your watch working?
Are you breaking up with Tom?

Tom, will you stop that?
Even Tom wouldn't do that

I'm wearing Tom's old pajamas
What are the options?
OK, Tom, let's shove off
How was dinner last night?
I don't want sugar
OK, Tom, let's get moving
Is Tom related to Mary?
It's way past Tom's bedtime
It's not Tom's decision
She's Argentinian
We are people, not gods
It's great to see you
It's nice to see you
It's really good to see you
It's no concern of yours
It isn't too late for you
It's getting worse
It's still not working
It's a family trait
It's not as bad as you think
It's not as hard as you think
It isn't the same thing
It's more than just that
It's not as simple as all that
It's a risk we must take
It's an old stereotype
It's a figure of speech
It's an ugly situation
It isn't quite that simple
It's not for me to say
It's a good policy
It's all going to work out
It's a bad time right now
It's just you and me now
It's out of my hands now
It's not real money
It's too good a chance to miss
It's not really up to me
It's really bothering me
It's been too long
It's a bad investment
It's not so bad here
It's for your own good
It isn't much further
It's going to work out fine
It's entirely my fault
It's all coming to an end
It's more than you deserve
It's been three days
It's fun to watch you dance
It's a reasonable conclusion
It's none of your concern
It's never been clearer
It's not funny anymore
And yours?
I've already slept this week
No one's arguing with you
That's entirely up to you
No one's stopping you
That's really nice of you
That's very nice of you
That's why I like you
So what can I do for you?
That's why I called you
Nobody's blaming you
Now, get on with your work
That's what we all want
Why does Tom look so upset?
I'm going to go with you
It's good seeing you
I've got good news for you
I'm sorry to disappoint you
We haven't done anything wrong
There's no way you can win
It's been quite a week
They're waiting for us
Now it's your turn
They're afraid of Tom
They've still got Tom
They couldn't kill Tom
They haven't found Tom
They're looking for Tom
They're going to kill Tom
They're going to hang Tom
They're going to find Tom
They're going to shoot Tom
They'll be looking for Tom
They haven't heard from Tom
They're all grinning at Tom
You pig!
Fucking traitor!" yells Tom
I'm not going to call Tom
They're going to torture Tom
Why were you looking for Tom?
They'll come looking for Tom
They're not going to stop Tom
They aren't going to help Tom
You said we'd never catch Tom
We lost, but we had fun
He's a brilliant economist
She's a brilliant economist
We've got one hour to find Tom
That's OK, Tom, it happens
Getting visuals, all good
Don't fall off your chair
I know you're quite busy
I shouldn't have written that
We shouldn't have written that
He shouldn't have written that
Have I slept a long time?
Nothing's wrong with Tom
Do you want me to go with Tom?
Did you understand Tom?
Do you really trust Tom?
Why are you lying to Tom?
Who listens to Tom?
Have you written to Tom?
Did you apologize to Tom?
Where did you send Tom?
Don’t fear
Not exactly.
Not exactly.
I'm not sure I agree with Tom
What was the matter with Tom?
Do you have classes with Tom?
Why are you so upset with Tom?
Why didn't you stay with Tom?
Are you still angry with Tom?
I'm still in love with Tom
Don't play poker with Tom
And you?
I'm sorry that I was born!
When does the next bus leave?
Automobile" is a hybrid word
Have you seen the news?
Word up, breda
Whatchu been up to?
I'll buy a boat soon
No one's going to find Tom
The alarm didn't wake Tom
I'm made from recycled plastic
Please reuse or recycle me!
Alright.
Attention!
I'm not jealous of Tom
If I were you, I would buy it
I'll put sugar in my coffee
It's my job to protect Tom
It's an evidently bad example
It's evidently a bad example
Who wrote this on me?
Imagine that I'm out of here
We can't do this without Tom
Did they ever find Tom?
Why can't we go and see Tom?
Why did they fire Tom?
Who's going to believe Tom?
Were you jealous of Tom?
Why are you calling Tom?
Are you going to ask Tom?
Why can't you just call Tom?
So what are birds actually?
Today, I have no free time
It's an obviously bad example
It's obviously a bad example
Have any of you seen Tom?
Did you say anything to Tom?
Shouldn't we help Tom?
What can we do to help Tom?
How would you help Tom?
Why are you mad at Tom?
When do I get to meet Tom?
Did you get to meet Tom?
What would we do without Tom?
Knit your eyebrows!
If you go, I'll go, too
Come home before 10 pm
Do we know who you are?
How can you see into my eyes?
Never mind, she will be fine
They're taking us for fools
How long is a piece of string?
Don't attach it to your head
Listen to my advice!
I think she's over forty
Don't play innocent
I hope I haven't woken you up
Just call me "Your Majesty
I'm sure she's right
I don't want to talk to anyone
It's not bothering anyone
I'll go if Tom goes
Police!
Nobody move!
She's a great girl
Eat, or else it will go cold
Don't lose heart
How's your old man doing?
I'm nothing like Mary
Why should I even care?
I don't believe this is true
Why did you break up with Tom?
I'll do that for sure
Is there a hospital nearby?
I've decided to trust Tom
I don't completely trust Tom
Talent is God-given; be humble
Fame is man-given; be thankful
Did you actually talk to Tom?
Today is mom's birthday
He's a reliable man
Whence came you?
Whence come babies?
I can't go anywhere else
Are you still at work?
Mary is Tom's youngest sister
You don't want to know!
You're lucky you're a boy
You're lucky you're a girl
Is that all that you can say?
He's so arrogant!
Don't play Tom at poker
Tom has found Mary's diary
It's so yummy
Mike, is this book yours?
Mike, is this your book?
Get out while you still can!
That's how they learnt English
See you tomorrow morning!
See you on the morrow!
Are all the bars shut?
He likes what I've done
She likes what I've done
Have you got any milk?
Do you have any milk?
Is it hard to be a vegetarian?
The phone keeps ringing today!
That's not what I asked you
Can you do a headstand?
What about me do you like?
Everything.
What were you supposed to do?
That's good advice
You can't do this anymore
You're about to go, right?
Don't invite him to the party
That makes you happy, right?
Don't call him for the party
Have you got a headache?
I'm drenched
That's hard to believe
I'm being blackmailed
We couldn't picnic
Don't call your father
I've been crying
Don't wake me up before 10
No, it's the only way
What makes you cry like that?
That's not good for business
I'm going to be too busy
Now we've got a chance
There's always a choice
Do you ever think about death?
That's what you deserve
That's a minor detail
What is God after all?
That's all I can do
That's what we're trying to do
That's what you have to do
What did you feed the dog?
I knew it wouldn't be easy
That's not quite big enough
That's not really enough
You can't have everything
You don't have all the facts
Inhale, and God approaches you
Exhale, and you approach God
Some things can't be fixed
That's what I'm fighting for
That's not very friendly
I knew it wouldn't be fun
They're willing to let you go
Well, I guess we should go
The answer is Yes, She is
I've spent a week in Istanbul
I've become friends with Jane
Let's play word associations
Hello, my friend!
How are you?
Now let's not be greedy
I'm a busy guy
That's all I do here
Please don't leave us here
That's why we're here
There's no way out of here
We don't belong here
We don't belong in here
It's self-explanatory
What is there to be afraid of?
Where the hell were you?
Why didn't you call me?
What's there to be afraid of?
I thought you liked him.
I do.
I can't talk right now
Sometimes, you think too much
Sometimes, I think too much
I'm always losing things
Tom's dog swims quite well
One learns by one's mistakes
John's gone to the shop
There's no one home
No one's going to be hurt
This isn't a good idea
You don't seem very impressed
I'm reading
She's waiting
It's such a daft idea
I'd like some information
They're doing a great job
Is she free this evening?
Is he free this evening?
I don't want to die yet
She's a born artist
Am I a coward or a tactician?
Tactician.
Tactician, surely.
You're the one
Mustafa, look at the horse
I'm praying
Whom are you waiting for?
Do you have any red pencils?
Your answer is important!
Can I borrow your computer?
Did you sleep well?
I slept like a log.
There's nobody in the kitchen
Tom didn't notice Mary leave
There's no one else left
Are you certain about this?
Absolutely certain?
Tom didn't like my suggestion
Did Tom really kill Mary?
We don't think Tom killed Mary
Are you bored?
I do.
Looks aren't important to me
There's no need to thank me
So what's on your mind?
Say what's on your mind
We've missed you so much
They'll negotiate
There's no need to be nervous
That wasn't very nice
I don't mind doing it
I've got to make supper now
That's what I was afraid of
I'm unable to say
That's not even an option
That's a direct order
That's a great outfit
That's a great plan
That's not the question
Would you please be quiet?
That's an unusual request
Well, I guess you were right
There's nobody in your room
You don't follow the rules
There's nowhere to run
That's what I said
That's very kind of you to say
Oh come on, don't be scared
There's no need to be sorry
They're all special
When did I realize I was God?
I'm spoken for, I apologize
How far do you live from here?
What's your GPA?
I didn't steal Tom's wallet
We're just friends," said Tom
I didn't steal it
That's a nice story
You don't seem very surprised
We're all sure of that
I didn't take it
I'm not impoverishing you
Tom read Mary's secret diary
I'd like to go to college
Tom found Mary's secret diary
Anything's possible
Where do you stay in Boston?
Kiss me!
What, really?
Didn't you say no kissing?
I said no kissing!
Sorry, I couldn't resist.
There's no need for threats
Now's not really the time
I'd like to see this film
Tom, what are you doing here?
Has she got a phone?
Look!
A four-leafed clover!
That's classified
He respected Mr. Hayakawa
Today is my aunt's birthday
I thought I'd surprise Tom
I've always respected Tom
Where will you stay in Boston?
How are you going to stop Tom?
What else did you say to Tom?
How intuitive!
Was that all you said to Tom?
Why won't you let me see Tom?
They are not cheap, though
Thank you for your help.
No worries.
Oh my God, I'm so ashamed
If you need anything, just ask
This doesn't make sense to me
Mary, hurry up
We're already late.
I'm not ready
Leave me alone!
It could've been worse
You could've died
It's a local legend
You don't want to go there.
Don't use your real name
I don't need a boyfriend
Aren't you scared, Tom?
The less you know, the better
Why do you live alone?
What can I do?
What are his true intentions?
What are her true intentions?
What are your true intentions?
He's going to drive me crazy!
She's going to drive me crazy!
I don't wash my hair every day
It's a fixer-upper
He's a brilliant artist
Does Tom have a tattoo?
What time are you meeting Tom?
How soon can I meet Tom?
Maybe you'd like to meet Tom
That's why I need to meet Tom
I'm a bird!
Enough!
Isn't it beautiful?
You're talking fast
If you need it, just take it
The weather is really great!
You're really a great person
Your house is really great!
I don't know what they know
I don't know what he knows
I don't know what she knows
I don't know what Tom knows
I shouldn't tell you
I really shouldn't tell you
Where is Tom?
Have you lost your tongue?
Why don't you answer?
Have you lost your tongue?
What's a jungle?
I think he's a bad person
I've read the first page
That's weird, isn't it?
There's hardly any wind today
We're not progressing
I'm an animal
That's weird, isn't it?
Yeah, it's a little weird.
That's so ironic
He's got style
Tom doesn't think about others
Tom has a six-figure salary
You're being too honest
Why did you keep it a secret?
Does that make me weird?
I don't know how, but I did it
Don't you just love it here?
I think I'd better go with Tom
May I show you something?
I swear, nothing happened
I've decided to fire Tom
Thanks God, you are fine
(Obey God to be a king)
He's a waste of space
It's as simple as that
Were you able to find Tom?
It's a blood orange
That's a blood orange
It's doing my head in
Do you know where to find Tom?
I'll help you fight Tom
This cannot be!
But it is!
Yeah?
Why couldn't you do that?
Don't go after her, man
It's just not worth it
Witches don't cry
What does "oncology" mean?
I've filled the glass
I've filled a glass
It isn't nearly enough
I'd like to learn
Is it really such a big deal?
It's wrong
Better don't venture here
Sure I do!
Who does want change?
That's incredibly boring
That's all I have to know
Where words fail, music speaks
Mary, I'm serious
Tom, I'm serious
Think global, act local
Think globally, act locally
He's a good bloke
I will get you sorted out, sir
Hold up there, sergeant
Live your passion!
He's my cousin
I don't feel so lucky
Maybe she has other plans?
Taste cold steel!
I don't know who knows
Come tomorrow at the latest!
What kind of crapola is this?
It's a proper interesting book
It's not essential to wait
I was at the baker's
I used to go to the baker's
I went to the baker's
Is he taller than his brother?
Today's show is a rerun
Am I ready to die?
While I work, I reflect
Is Tom still at school?
He's crazy
You and I, we are friends
Show me what you're made of!
It's time to buckle down
Excuse me, where's the exit?
Come on, admit it
Come on, hurry up
Come on, let's go
Come on, touch it
Come on, trust me
Do you have a menu in English?
Do you have an English menu?
How hungry are you, Tom?
How hungry are you?
What exactly did you ask Tom?
Do you still love Tom?
Have you ever studied abroad?
We didn't see him
We didn't see her
It's quarter past one
It's half past one
He isn't very happy today
It's such a shame
It's a great little car
Are we on the air?
Do I look like an idiot?
Do I look like an idiot?
No, not at all.
It's obvious that you like him
It's obvious that you like her
Let's turn over a new leaf
I have taken out a life-policy
Good afternoon!
How are you finding the party?
Why do you believe Tom?
Why don't you help Tom?
Why should I worry about Tom?
Why shouldn't I do that?
There, a squirrel" "What?
Where?
Do you see it?
Yes, I see it!
Do you know much about Boston?
Do you know much about that?
Do you know much about Tom?
Yes!
I will kill her!
You'll see, I will kill her!
I'm buttering the bread
What has changed since then?
What are we debating now?
Has the climate changed?
Don't fret too much
Can that be right?
Enough, stop this fight!
Come on, make a move!
Do not criticize anybody!
It's time to get up
Why is everyone so tense?
Why are you all still awake?
Why is everybody laughing?
Why are you all laughing?
I really, really want this
Hey, slow down!
Tom's last name is Mary
I don't want this doll
Do you want to trade?
Where do you buy bus tickets?
Haven't you lost some weight?
Are you eating properly?
We'll make it.
Ouch!
I bit my tongue!
They can't both be right
Are you ready for the truth?
Yes, I understand
Shall we take a picture here?
Mum!
Tom ate my cookie!
Let's play football today
He's writing a letter
Don't lean against the doors
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
Why are boys so stupid?
Why are boys so dumb?
No, I'm not crazy
He's dead
I'm sick of lying
Did you do that?
No, Mom, I didn't.
I'll come back
We'll see you off

Tom, unlike Mary, can run fast
We've got this in the bag
Stop screaming!
He's as good as his word
She's not to blame
Was it you who did this?
Can we consider that settled?
Why announce such a measure?

Everything's just crap.
I feel like that, too.
Cheer up!

He's Danish.
We're going down the pub
Do you fancy coming?
What can I do to help today?
Do you buy bottled water?
It's fascinating, isn't?
Is French your mother tongue?
Something isn't adding up here
Machines are taking over!
Some details aren't known yet
What are you doing at home?
Here's something to consider
A can-opener is technology
It's up to the court to decide
Will you tell us the truth?
You aren't a child anymore
What's the good of doing it?
Tell him that for me.
It's not so bad
I mean, she's cute.
No, she's not
And looks don't matter.
That's different.
It's the same thing!
You even deserve better!
It's not for me to decide
One mustn't be too trusting
So we have a problem..
I've long wished to do that
Yes, I'll take some ham too
I'm on the streets
Has he finished his call?
Don't go to Tom now
Don't obey him!
Tom's a strange guy, isn't he?
Well, it takes all kinds.
Well, when in Rome.
Would it be okay to buy this?
It isn't very expensive..
Let's lose our minds together
Let's lose our souls together
It's not that expensive
I wish I'd been born a man
It's Aramaic

Don't take any notice of Tom
Tom tried his father's suit on
Don't play dumb
Tom's face went pale
I've lost one of my gloves
The soldier won't fight
This soldier won't fight
It's not easy to learn
Tom said that he'd try to help
He's always late
Who needs all this junk?
This is my great-grandfather
We don't have enough to eat
Tom, is this yours?
Tom was wide-awake
Mary was wide-awake
It'll kill the pain
He's due to arrive tomorrow
He's above suspicion
He's thirsty for fame
She's a good English speaker
She's the messenger
She's a second year student
Please tell us what you think?
In fact, he's a nice fellow

Good luck or disaster?

危うく
This concerns you, idiot!
You're a journalist
They don't have a bicycle
I don't remember my height
I can't go there alone
You're not worried, are you?
Don't try to cover for Tom
That's an assumption
That can't be proven
Did you say your prayers?
You're not in trouble
You don't have a bicycle
How could they have known?
Why did Tom want to stay home?
The water's getting higher
They didn't agree with Mary
That's for Tom to decide
Tom always gets home at 2:30
How does that water taste?
You are NOT normal!
I'll completely defeat you!
Why don't you decide?
He'll come here by car
Tom won't answer that question
You don't have time?
When are your final exams?
I'm so not ready for this test
I'll definitely be there
Look around!

But I still don't like it.
What don't you like?
Never mind.
Don't use that pen
I couldn't put up with Tom
Help them!

Do you care about quality?
Leave us!
Mother tongue: Swabian!
Wait here!
Here, please
Don't learn

I'd rather not run into Tom
He's a very smart boy
She's a total stranger to me
He's a really good worker
She's not very well off
He's fond of adventure
He's no good as a lawyer
She's certain to be surprised
Tom won't call you anymore
I love you, my darling!
We'd better act fast
Have you ever eaten frog legs?
He's a very intelligent boy
Make sure Tom doesn't go
I don't intend to kill you
Tom won't come tonight
You're my friend, right?
That's mildly disturbing
Mary's eyes shone
I'm always with my nose open
Don't keep company with Tom
I know I'm a clown
Have you ever ridden a camel?
What about visiting Tom?
Joe, dude, you're a weirdo!
It's not like you're a dog!
Why do you hate Tom so much?
He's a pretty good guy.
Look!
They're selling Warabi
I think it's okay to talk
The water was 30 meters deep
You'll get a licking
Tom isn't going to laugh
First class or economy?
I don't swim as well as you
Tom is 30 going on 10
Why can't we live together?
Tom won't let me go
In Spanish, a primo is a primo
The water's thirty degrees
We're in deep trouble
Have you ever visited London?
Aren't you worried about Tom?
Why should I be?
No – why should I have?
My wife's name is Mary
Are you angry with me?
I'm just popping to the loo
I'll just nip to the loo
I'm playing football tomorrow
It only gets half full.
They're not that dear.
At the back, by the toilets.
Tom, say 'I love you'.
Er, what?
Say 'I love you'.
Why?
Just because!
I love you.
Ta!
What's that all about?
Oh, nothing!
Think nothing of it.
We can't go anywhere
Tom can't take a hint
I've got hardly any books
I've got next to no books
I don't know
We've never spoken about it
I don't know
Do you want to answer or not?
We'll run out of petrol soon
We'll soon be out of petrol
My watch says it's ten o'clock
Don't drink ice water
Can you keep it a secret?
OK.
I will, too.
Tom won't find Mary there
Isn't it overly superficial?
What about sincerity?
We'd better act quickly
It's our turn to do that
It's our turn with the boys
It isn't much of a change
The concert wasn't a big deal
Our group has 5 people
I'm sorry
Arguing about it won't help
I've come to ask for a favor
You've no future
I don't want to change this
He's got the upper hand
I don't believe a word he says
If he catches us, we're done
Did you pass the test?
Good for you!
It's a question of character
Don't want to change me
I'll put the pasta in
Don't overdo the wine
Tom's dog is voracious
Mom, I have to poop
Where is the grocery store?
How many unicorns did you see?
We met at the notary's office
Which one do you prefer?
He's always sulking
Does he have the book?
We've got a lot of water
For heaven's sake!
It didn't suit me
He's angry with his boss
What do you do all day?
I eat.
You don't miss a thing!
Nothing escapes you, does it!
It's two hours there by bus
What are you up to here?
We weren't afraid
Mary's got enough time
Mary didn't have enough money
To me, it's mackerel pike
We're not ill
We weren't ill
You idiot!
What were you thinking?
He didn't give in
You don't need to thank me
You're hiding something!
You haven't done anything
You've done nothing
Wait until 6 p.m
Wait until six o'clock
Don't stare like that
Where are their newspapers?
Where are her newspapers?
Do you like their songs?
I'll consider your proposal
What are you doing up?
It's three in the morning
I'm going to the train station
How are you spending New Year?
Mom, I need some new shoes
Nothing escapes you, does it?
I'm not mad at you
I'm mad at myself
The water's 38 degrees
Tom has a guitar-shaped pool
You're the only girl for me
You're the only woman for me
Do you ever read tabloids?
Tom types 70 words a minute
What do you like to cook?
How often do you cook?
Are these books interesting?
The pain's gotten much worse
My watch says it's 2:30
What's it like working there?
Do you like working with Tom?
How do you like working here?
Do you enjoy doing this?
It's nasty weather
He's usually pretty meek
Do you miss the beach?
Can you give me your number?
Who sent you all these emails?
It's been three hours
Will he be a good president?
Is this course good?
How many siblings do you have?
How about you?
I have one.
How about we take a break?
What was your decision?
And why don't you tell him?
I'm completely teetotal
I'll sit in the other one
You're too normal
Do you have a cigarette?
Sir, please put on your mask
Earth?
It's time you knew the truth
You're always late for school
Don't forget, all right?
You're just a blowhard
Tom's hands were all dirty
Where does your father live?
Which bus should I get?
Which bus do I have to get?
Which bus do I need to get?
What bus do I need to get?
Was the doctor here today?
I'm thirsty!" complained Mary
I'd lend you money if I had it
She's known better days
Of course, you had a choice
Tom didn't do this willingly
You aren't tall like I am
I'll go if Tom goes, too
You aren't as tall as I am
What is on your face?

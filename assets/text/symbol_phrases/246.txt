I've been very busy all week
I wish that I wasn't married
Why haven't you done that?
Who forced you to do that?
Tom said he wasn't from Boston
I think that I'll do that
Can we get you to do that?
I think I'll like being here
You did that, didn't you?
I think I must've dreamed it
Who did you do that with?
We hope that doesn't happen
Would you like to go with Tom?
Tom wouldn't allow Mary to go
I'll start my diet tomorrow
Let's do that once again
Tom thought Mary wasn't happy
Could you do that for us?
Tom thought Mary wasn't funny
Who did you do that for?
I think that's pretty clear
I'm investigating the crimes
Like Sherlock Holmes?
Enough!
I want more!
I'm going to take up knitting
I don't hold a candle to him
It's a magic potion
He's a nobody
She's a nobody
They're thugs
Pray!
It's quite an easy language
I'm uninterested in sex
What's wrong with eating dogs?
Why is that?
I think it'll be a busy week
Tom didn't expect to get paid
Would you like to hang out?
We're going out for a walk
Yesterday was Tom's birthday
I don't plan to do that
What's Tom going to do today?
Could we try to do that?
I've been busy all morning
I wish that I weren't here
I was hoping you'd be here
Can you do that for us?
Who does that anymore?
Which of you did that?
Is that really your fault?
Tom needs to be here by 2:30
I've done that before
I wish that I wasn't here
I wish that I hadn't hit Tom
I think we've been polite
Tom wouldn't let Mary drive
Who did that for you?
Can we do that later?
Where should we go first?
Can we do that again?
Where can I study French?
May I do that later?
Where can I learn French?
Let's do that later
What should we eat first?
Tom's father is a smuggler
Can we do that here?
Tom wasn't easy to talk to
That won't be hard to do
Don't you do that
That won't be easy to do
When I woke up, I had lost it
How could Tom be so cruel?
How could Tom be so heartless?
How could Tom be so mean?
I moved here in 2013
I'm going go get some help
Aren't you sad?
How can Tom help?
Are you retired?
Is Tom on a diet?
Aren't you done?
Aren't you rich?
Aren't you sure?
Aren't you a cop?
Tom left at 2:30
Aren't you loyal?
Will Tom do that?
Aren't you lucky?
French isn't easy
Tom didn't scream
Aren't you all mad?
Aren't you anxious?
Tom does that, too
Aren't you doctors?
Aren't you furious?
Tom went to Mary's
Aren't you in pain?
Aren't you insured?
Aren't you jealous?
Aren't you over 18?
This is Tom's house
Aren't you psyched?
Aren't you psychic?

Don't you want soup?
Did Tom do that today?
Don't you want that?
Has Tom done that yet?
Don't you want this?
Is Tom in the kitchen?
Aren't you a student?
That's all Tom can do
Aren't you a teacher?
Aren't you all alone?
Aren't you all ready?
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
I don't want to hear you again
The woman is talking non-stop
He wasn't listening to her
They're bad people
They eat dogs.
So?
I don't see the problem.
He wasn't at all satisfied
Aren't you alone now?
Aren't you bored yet?

Tom's wallet was empty
Could you sing for us?
Where does Tom do that?
Don't you want to eat?

I can't give you this

Are all languages related?
Clap!
See?
We haven't found the girl
We haven't found the boy
She's a dictator
He's a dictator
You should be more open-minded
He's a picky eater
She's a picky eater
Why are there so many Indians?
Sit!
Live!
Breathe!
Were you guys serious?
Were you all serious?
We'll find you another lawyer
Aren't you kids hungry?
Did Tom do that for you?
Aren't you on the list?
Did Tom do that himself?
Aren't you on the team?
Don't you trust Tom now?
Aren't you on vacation?

Don't you want anything?
This isn't Tom's problem
Don't you want children?
Don't you want me there?

Layla didn't have a good job
Layla's husband was gone
I'm not asking you
I'm telling you
I'm not asking you
I'm ordering you to do that
Layla wasn't about to give up
Layla didn't attract attention
It was all Layla's idea
Layla didn't have a job
Layla wasn't at school
Who will save us?
I can't stand his hypocrisy
I can't stand her hypocrisy
I can't stand your hypocrisy
Am I hypocritical?
What does your shirt say?
The phone's stopped working
The laptop's stopped working
The TV's stopped working
Was that too much to ask?
Do not drink too much brandy!
Try it!
That bitch cheated on me.
That shit's fucked up, man.
Who is funding the project?
Who's funding the project?
Layla graduated in 2002
Layla tasted Sami's blood
Sami broke Layla's jaw
Layla didn't come home
What was her name again?
Layla is Sami's stepdaughter
Layla's honeymoon was over
Layla's body was in the trunk
Layla can't remember his name
I don't know what's that
Layla was Sami's type
Layla couldn't resist
Layla didn't feel well
Layla's body was put in a bag
Layla wasn't hit by gunfire
Layla was Sami's first crush
Can you help Layla?
I'm pregnant
What about a slice of pizza?
Layla and Sami weren't alone
Layla noticed Sami's presence
Yes, the baby is yours
Layla's whole demeanor changed
Layla didn't even notice
Is my baby OK?
There's no doubt in my mind
Layla's baby is her everything
He's her heart and soul
Sami is Layla's hero
Will you be my valentine?
Did you eat the last cookie?
Tom's parents are wealthy
It's midnight
How was a trip?
Could you repeat?
When is it?
I don't have job
I don;t have a job
I don't have a job
I've only got a part-time job
Can you work weekends?
I did not ask to be born!
You want to see?
Can I take a shower?
I think I'll be busy this week
Which books should I read?
What books do you recommend?
Can you prove I'm wrong?
It's a depressing prospect
You're really dirty
You're filthy
You're very dirty
Don't fuck with me
The gang's all here
Escape!
Flee!
They're breeding like rabbits
What's money?
It's fake news
We're going to build a wall
I'll drop you on my way.
If you insist.
Shut your mouth, Layla
Where is Layla?
Isn't she with you?
It's a warning from nature
I don't wanna talk to anyone
I don't wanna talk to anyone.
Not even your sweetheart?
I couldn't say a word
How to explain this?
I'm feeling just fine
What happened to Layla?
It's all your fault
I hate everyone.
Everyone?
Yes, everyone except you.
You wanna know something?
I'll teach you good manners
Are these books yours?
Are these condoms yours?
If you want me, I'm in my room
If you need me, I'm in my room
Why didn't you explain to me?
He's the one
You know I couldn't do that
Is Layla in the clinic?
This is a clinic, not a gym
It's much worse than that
It's all your fault, Layla
I knew you'd come, my darling
This isn't the time for that
You musn't talk now
I beg you, my darling..
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me
I'm so afraid
Do you still enjoy doing that?
No Internet after nine o'clock
Layla was daddy's little girl
The flowers are beautiful.
You're beautiful.
I've got to go
It's my dad again
It's decision night for Layla
I don't like this hat.
How about this one?
Is something wrong, darling?
Sorry, I didn't see the sign
I'm leaving this town
I'm leaving this town tonight
I can't believe it
Just don't shoot
It's not safe
Layla didn't dare get involved
Hurry up!
Layla isn't with Sami
Layla wasn't with Sami
I don't feel very lucky
That didn't change anything
Dad.
Yes, darling.
I think that Mom..
I've spoken to your teachers
It's all thanks to Sami
Why isn't Sami coming?
Why isn't Sami coming tonight?
Where have you been, Sami?
Sami just couldn't resist
Sami carried a 9mm pistol
Sami endangered Layla's life
Sami was a soulless ex-con
Is Sami a threat to society?
Sami didn't get very far
Sami didn't have family there
Sami's request was granted
Sami used Layla's credit card
Sami didn't get far
Layla's dog found a dead body
Sami cared for Layla's dog
We don't need any more horses
Sami's hair fell out
Is there a security problem?
That's a barbaric practice
I can't concentrate
The jokes weren't funny
Do you know whose it is?
Whose region, his religion
I'm reading a biography
I'm reading an autobiography

Layla shouldn't be here today
Layla met Sami's friends
Layla isn't so bad
Layla gained Sami's affection
Layla didn't worry about it
Layla wasn't impressed
Can I see your phone?
What's inappropriate about it?
I find this very emasculating.
Layla's neighbor called 911
Layla didn't remember anything

Layla's head was shaved
Layla's shotgun was missing
Layla befriended Sami's sister
Layla isn't crazy
Layla's body was on the couch
Layla's body was on the floor
Layla couldn't be found at all
Layla's story was unbelievable
What a time to be alive!
Layla betrayed Sami's trust
No, I'm not hungry
Layla's car is really nice
Layla was at Sami's mercy
Layla's demeanor changed
Layla's daring plan worked
No, I'm not thirsty
Layla went to bed at 9 PM
That's a beautiful horse
It's a dragon!
How can a person be so stupid?
Do you have kidney stones?
Do you have hepatitis?
Do you have the flu?
Do you have syphilis?
She's not lying
He's not lying
They're not lying
She wasn't lying
He wasn't lying
You weren't lying
They weren't lying
You're not lying
How could he do such a thing?
How could she do such a thing?
He didn't believe me
She didn't believe me
You didn't believe me
I'm glad to hear Tom did that
Do both Tom and Mary do that?
Can both Tom and Mary do that?
I'd like to stay longer
I'd like to leave soon
Can Tom and Mary both do that?
Do Tom and Mary both do that?
I'd like to do that someday
I'd like to do that soon
Why would he do such a thing?
Why would she do such a thing?
You monster!
You're dead to me
He's dead to me
She's dead to me
They're dead to me
May I do that now?
Can we do that now?
Let's change seats
How could we do that?
Let's switch seats
When could I do that?
Who broke the dish?
Can I do that for you?
Tom's car is cool
Do you like carrots?
Will Tom be there?
When could we do that?
When could you do that?
Tom thinks so, too
Where could we do that?
We're still confused
Tom's hair is wavy
Tom's hair is brown
When could Tom do that?
Tom's hair is curly
Tom didn't dare do that
We're still in danger
What's in your closet?
Where could you do that?
Where should we do that?
Let's have some coffee
I won't help you do that
Where could Tom do that?
Who's going to help us?
I know you didn't do that
I won't help Tom do that
I don't want to do that here
All this stuff is Tom's
Aren't you going to vote?
All these pens are Tom's
Who could we do that with?
Tom didn't want any help
Why can't we do that, too?
Tom didn't want our help
Haven't you ever done that?
I'm going to quit trying

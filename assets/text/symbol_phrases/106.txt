Perhaps it's even me
I'll come on May 23rd
I've got a headache
I'm making house repairs
We demand actions, not words
He's afraid of making mistakes
Has Lucy called already?
She's not penniless
Where's my watch?
Apparently, the bus is late
I've gone to Kyoto twice
Let's see each other again
Just not now, however
Let's have our picture taken
Is that thing yours?
It's bedtime
So this is for you!
May I have some more coffee?
What does this sign mean?
When are you coming home?
When are you leaving?
He's mumbling something
It's not mine.
If you want to be loved, love!
I'm in love with you
It's a page short
I'd like a little bit of cake
I'm just looking
That's mostly right
You eat in the classroom?
My period hasn't come
Do you have something to say?

Clean your teeth!
Are you involved in politics?
I don't like him either
The world's your studio
I'm dead tired
There's no class today
Don't kick the dog!
Can I take a day off?

Let's call it a day
What's the width of this road?
Whom did you give it to?
Let's meet up somewhere
It's exactly half-past eight
You're always singing
It's going nicely!
I don't even have time to read
We've run enough for one day
I am an eternal PC-newbie
I haven't slept for days
Aah!" she sighed
Why don't people hibernate?
I'm a starved spider
I've forgotten
Today, I went to the doctor's
I haven't studied that much!
He's digging his own grave
She's digging her own grave
Ah!
I forgot again!
I can't find my glasses
How are you, darling?
Hello, how are you doing?
And no one helped you?
And nobody helped you?
I'll reach to the moon
And that's how you'll set out.
I couldn't believe my ears!
It's just a dream
It's only a dream
Really?
Why?
It's late
I'm more positive now
He's a chain smoker
You're weird
She's rather clueless
Hi, are you OK?
You're a daring man!
OK, now lie still on your back
This is impossible!
Don't worry
I don't understand this
I don't believe in God
What is your sister doing now?
I've always hated biology
It's fine," Dima laughed
I'm still growing, after all
I'll grow into it.
I've given up smoking
How did you come to hear that?
Do you smoke?
Get ready!
There's not a cloud in the sky
You've started warming up
I want eternal life!
It's raining again!
What more do you want, blood?
I'm angry
That'll be 3,000,000.99, then.
I'm too old for this world
Be quiet and listen!
Don't take it so seriously
I'll do it if they pay me
You've gotten hitched?
Stop it this minute!
He didn't find what I hid
She'll never speak of it
He's smarter than her
Who's paying for the food?
This pilaf tastes great!
And the people?
What will they say?
Time for action!
Don't pay it any heed
Where's the bank?
Thanks for the help.
Don't mention it.
Did the baby wake up?
We'll start with page 30
He'll be here soon
Someday you'll regret this
It's good if you can sing
I've got two brothers
Do you have work experience?
I don't know a thing about her
She's muttering something
He wasn't expecting to see you
I don't have time right now
I'm in a hurry
You're the love of my life
She doesn't like sushi
I was afraid I'd be late
I'm too busy to go
I'll call you back
She is poor, but she is happy
When did you get married?
How long did you live there?
Sorry, I couldn't help it
She almost said "I don't know
That's crazy
At what hour was she born?
I'll meet him tomorrow
It's mine, not hers
It's mine, not its
What time was she born?
Important!

Man proposes, but God disposes
Everyone out, please
A little smile won't hurt
Tom loves fly-fishing
Wow, that's amazing!
What is your ideal man?
What is your ideal woman?
Did she tell the truth?
Turn my headphones up!
I think I'm being watched
What do you mean with this?
I'm an Arabic teacher
Sami doesn't like the teacher
Sami's teacher overheard him
Sami's teachers hated him
I am a house-husband
The teacher called me "fat.
The teacher body-shamed me
The gym teacher calls me "fat.
You're done yelling at me?
My teacher's name is Mrs Bakir
Do you understand my Arabic?
It's almost impossible to find
She's a sweet teacher
How do we know this?
The teacher just doesn't care
This wasn't my teacher
She's not even a teacher
She's very strict as a teacher
She's a teacher that I have
I'm a substitute teacher
Tom doesn't like frog legs
Tom doesn't like snails
I mustn't forget my passport
I'm going to leave the country
I don't like this teacher
She wasn't a good teacher
The teacher didn't believe us
Teachers don't get paid enough
It's my former teacher
Is this teacher asking me out?
The teacher can't control us
I was in the teacher's room
I'm about to go on vacation
I don't have much to do
Is it cold?
I have to lose weight!
Put your socks on first!
I don't know Japanese
You are already my wife!
How much salt do you need?
How much water do you have?
How much is the room?
Don't get too fat!
How clever she is!
You don't seem to get it
It's made of steel
He called me "fag.
I can't deny this
It's already typhoon season
Are you wearing gloves?
The teacher didn't choose me
I was a teacher, too
I had that teacher in 2006
I don't talk about my teachers
Is this woman my swim teacher?
He's our math teacher
She kissed the teacher's ass
It can't be done alone
How are you, Dylan?
How are you, Dragon?
What is your vocation?
How far did we walk yesterday?
I promise it isn't poison
Mary's dog isn't well-read
In fact, it can't read at all
Can you visit?
Where are you traveling to?
Are you still sore?
How are your blisters?
You need anti-blister socks
It's simple, really
He's a master liar
Mary spoiled, rich and snobby
Tom is clean-shaven
Mary stole Alice's boyfriend
Tom stole John's girlfriend
Let's go
I haven't broken any law
Tom wore well-tailored clothes
I'd love to, but I'm busy.
Snails are slow; Tom is slower
Can I play with you?
Who caught this fish?
Where do we go now?
I'm not anorexic
Do dead people watch us?
Nature doesn't belong to us
Nature doesn't belong to us
It's already too late for that
When are you visiting?
Twenty percent fluent?
What does that mean?
Can you flip over the record?
When did you buy a phonograph?
When do you leave for Boston?
It's too hot to exercise today
I'm super tired
Why are you barely moving?
It's winter in Australia
Have you ever been to Asia?
How do you see your future?
Why is math so hard?
Who's the letter addressed to?
Can you write down the chords?
What did you get on the test?
There isn't much more to add
I'll never be able to retire
What do you want answers to?
Did you paint this yourself?
Did you get another raise?
What will the trip cost?
It'll certainly be fun
Have you had lunch yet?
Are these flowers real?
What did Tom say then?
When will you retire?
I ate ice cream, too
That's unreasonable
The sign says "no smoking
Don't be a shit
I don’t like this new upgrade
Does he like beer?
I think he'll stay
She is really very beautiful!
Is Tom still inside?
It's just talk
Alas! what lot is thine?
She's a marvel
I'd like to speak with you
We don't need his permission
We don't need her permission
We don't need their permission
We don't need Tom's permission
You don't need her permission
You don't need his permission
I didn't know I could do this
I didn't know I could do that
Too much talk, no work
I finally got the job!
You're wrong, though
What are you doing tonight?
I'm not sure.
So what is Tom doing tonight?
What are you doing tonight?
I'll let you know.
Nothing in particular.
He's no liar
Now he doesn't need money
You don't see well
What about yours?
Mine, too.
What about yours?
Mine are too.
He didn't like me
Do you know what I mean?
Actually, Tom, I don't.
I'm leaving without him
I'll leave without him
I'm leaving without it
I'll leave without it
Are you fine?
Down with the police!
Down with autocracy!
What do you want blind one?
It's light!
Who took my computer?
Can he write at least?
Enough of your lies!
I've already lived in Coimbra
Tom's just trying to save face
Your story wasn't interesting
Have you been busy recently?
That's something he can't do
It’s a beautiful, windy day
What a day for a dog’s nose!
Is it possible to talk now?
Don't order anything for me
She's busy
You're sending a letter
You're mixing things up
You're conflating things
That's really fortunate
Aren't you a Canadian?
What's your WiFi password?
I don't want you to stay here
Who can address this issue?
Everything's well
“It basically cleaned itself.”
There's only one solution
Most people don't know this
Did you say "thirty euros"?
Is Tom going to walk again?
Will Tom ever walk again?
Do you like speaking French?
Are you feeling adventurous?
How adventurous are you?
What did you talk about?
Nothing.
“At 2 o’clock [a.m.]
“I felt very scared
We are getting married!
Now everyone's happy
Do you like fish curry?
It might be hot!
Do they sell rose quartz?
Do you want to become a witch?
You're rude and disrespectful
It's not worth mentioning
It would be overkill, Tom
It's autumn again
Where are you, my darling?
Where are you, darling?
Am I so naive and innocent?
A lamb to the slaughter?
A lamb at the butcher's?
Who wants independence?
No, he can't
No, he won't be able
Yes, he can
I believe we’ve already met
In reality, you're not here
You're a foreigner?
Where are you from?
When was this song released?
It's not an urgent matter
Was the concert well attended?
Do you know Tom's password?
Did Oprah really say that?
What did Oprah say?
Tom's boss yelled at him
The fuck is this shit?
The fuck?
The fuck is wrong with you?
Is he swimming?
Is she swimming?
Come on, we have work to do
Why don't you obey me?
Tom's jaw dropped
I'm going to look ridiculous
Where did your friend go?
I'm not pouting
Don't pout
By the way, I have a boyfriend
I've got a better solution
Do you have a healing potion?
You'd better change
Tom didn't want to live alone
Tom didn't want to be lonely
You could've been mistaken
You should've written it down
That'll take too much time
Thanks, but no thanks!
We've overslept again!
My friends won't talk to me
Everyone goes for his song!
Everyone plays his game!
Don't go near the dogs
Don't try to catch the dog
It's dangerous
I heard some dogs barking.
They were wolves.
It's nothing
It's just a dog
Sami didn't have a dog
Sami didn't even have a dog
Sami didn't hear the dog growl
Sami didn't see the dog
Sami didn't want to have a dog
Sami's dog died
Sami's dogs were starving
Sami killed Layla's dogs
Sami killed Layla's dog, too
Sami lost Layla's dog

Sami's dog was full of energy
Sami's dog was very strong
Sami's dog was growling
Sami's dog was his best friend
Sami's dog was in the basement
Sami's dog was lying in bed
Sami's dog was still there
Sami's dogs were badly behaved
Sami's dog was in his car
Sami's dogs were acting crazy
Sami's dogs weren't barking
There's a wild dog around here
I'm taking the dog to the vet
Are you a dog person?
Does Sami like dogs?
It's my neighbor's dog
That's my dog snoring
I'm not a dog
I'm not a dog
I'm not your dog
My neighbor's dog was barking
Why are the dogs barking?
I didn't call him "dog.
Why is this dog following me?
Are these your dogs?
Are those your dogs?
Is this your dog, Sir?
Is this Layla's dog?
Is your dog alright?
Does this dog bite?
It's a stupid dog
Is this a cat or a dog?
The teacher didn't see me
She's not even a math teacher
You're a math teacher
My teacher called me "slut.
He's just a cool teacher
We've got a new teacher
Why do you hate your teacher?
You're a horrible teacher
Teachers don't know everything
That teacher can't fail me
I can't have him as my teacher
Excuse me!
Who are you?
It seems like she's ill
She lacks self-confidence
You're trying to pray
I don't want your advice
I'm trying to do something
It's a high liquidity market
I'll just run some diagnostics
Do you buy it?
Here's my luggage
Try the penne all'arrabbiata
Tom's favorite dish is lasagna
Do you like this backpack?
Do you like this purse?
Do you like that shirt?
Do you like that blouse?
Do you like this wallet?
It's nothing to be afraid of
Mary, what are you reading?
Tom, what are you reading?
Don't be so quiet!
I'm happy, but he's tired
I hope they're OK
He won't let anything past!
It's as if no one voted
While eating, we chew slowly
Are you human?
You don't miss me
Tom is the one responsible!
Does someone else want to eat?
There's how I raised the tent
Tom, get up!
Tom, wake up!
It's late!
I don't remember what I wanted
Have fun in Italy!
I'm eating sausages
We’re all huge nerds
He's just a bluffing charlatan
I'm expecting a full refund
The dog's food is expensive
I adore Sino-Tibetan languages
No pictures or video, please
It isn't as easy as it sounds
It's not as easy as it sounds
It's not as hard as it sounds
It isn't as hard as it sounds
Where is the Greek consulate?
Does Mary hate me?
I did it just for you!
Hope you're well
By then, it was far too late
You're well, I imagine!
I hope you're doing well!
Shall we try it?
She's a writer
She's a journalist
Is he healthy?
Peter's wife is a brunette
I don't like football
Everybody's a critic
Tom stroked the horse's neck
Mary stroked the horse's neck
Tom stroked the horse's head
Tom stroked the horse's muzzle
The meeting was moved to 11:15
Do you speak German?
No, I'm French.
You have it all backwards!
Why punch Nazis?
Because I love peace.
Because he's an asshole.
I won't tell anyone, I promise
Have you ever lied to me?
Please, where are you from?
Please, who are you?
She's dead
Whom are you describing?
What is an auto-da-fé?
Why do you have so many pets?
How can I make amends?
Cat-eared characters are cute!
Who's a good kitty?
You're a good kitty
You're a very good kitty
Wow, tough crowd
Promise me you'll come back
Who wants apple pie?
It's raining since two days
He's running
Educate your children!
Who went with him?
We've overslept again
Why do you hate dogs so much?
That's my neighbor's dog
That's one of my dogs
There's a dog following us
You'd better go get dressed
I hope you're doing well
That's a beautiful sword
Why do we need hope?
He's a nice person
She's a nice person
He's really cool
She's really cool
He's learning Arabic
What time tomorrow?
I’ll just slick my hair back
Do you have any hair gel?
Where the hell is this?
Where the hell is that?
Do we have enough milk?
Have we got enough milk?
I don't have a crocodile
Cats have a nice, soft fur
Where do you buy your clothes?
How many times?
I’m number one in the world
Bad weather won't last forever
That's it!
Where will your friends sleep?
Where is my pen?
Is that problematic for you?
Dinner!
Breakfast!
Writing paper, please!
More work?
He lies!
He's lying!
She lies!
She's lying!
Attention, danger to life!
Forget that!
Mary's voice trembled slightly
Tom's voice trembled slightly
I don't like that part of town
You are unbeatable!
You are unstoppable!
They are unstoppable!
We are unstoppable!
She is unstoppable!
He is unstoppable!
I am unstoppable!
Close!
I hope so!
It's status quo
I'm looking for postcards
Where are they, please?
I'm looking for T-shirts
I have temporal-lobe epilepsy
What confusion!
Such a confusion!
Tom's a dead man
He just doesn't know it yet
This suit is fire-resistant
We're university students
We're college students
He's fighting a losing battle
Where's his sentence?
Do you like suits?
The girl saw her, too
The girl saw them, too
The girl saw him, too
Its name's Tom
It didn't take much
Is she hiding something?
How much sugar is healthy?
Stay calm, please
It's better that way
Take the honey and butter!
It seems we're in trouble
I'm feeling a bit better
I will leave next week!
I can't find my braces
Do I have any other choice?
Is that a shitpost?
Let's face it
Are we sure about this?
Are we sure about that?
Now get cracking!
“Are you hungry?”
“Not yet.”
That’s pretty sick
Did you like this book?
You've taken out the trash
Where will they be?
We're living a beautiful time
Ah, him?
He's only a braggart!
I must've drifted off
I don't like this part of town
It's started snowing
I suppose you know it, too
I don't think I know her
Tom knew I'd be prudent
Tom knew that I'd be prudent
Tom knew Mary wouldn't lie
Tom knew I wouldn't laugh
Tom knew that I wouldn't laugh
Tom isn't as efficient as Mary
I'm not trying to scare anyone
I'm glad Tom is going to be OK
I think you're weird
I think that you're weird
I think you're very smart
I think that you're very smart
I think you're ugly

I think you're dying
I think that you're dying
I think you're delusional
I think that you're delusional

I think you're cool
I think that you're cool
I think you're conceited
I think that you're conceited
I think you're brilliant
I think that you're brilliant
I think you're bossy
I think that you're bossy
I think you're a terrific kid
I think you're a likable guy
I think we'll find it
I think that we'll find it
I think we'll be competitive
I think Tom won't get bored
I think Tom won't be drunk
I think Tom won't be confused
I think it's kind of crazy
I think they've been great
I think that's a misconception
I think it's too soon to judge
I think it's fantastic
I think that it's fantastic
I think it's a healthy debate
I think it's a challenge
I think that it's a challenge
I think it'll be good for Tom
I think it'll haunt me forever
I think I'm interesting
I think that I'm interesting
I think I'll cry
I think that I'll cry
I think I'd rather not sing
I sure hope Tom doesn't sing
I said I'd try
I said that I'd try
I knew I shouldn't waste time
I promise I'll laugh
I promise that I'll laugh
I knew you'd laugh
I knew that you'd laugh
I hope Tom isn't timid
I hope that Tom isn't timid
I hope Tom isn't stoned
I hope that Tom isn't stoned

I hope that Tom isn't sloshed
I hope Tom isn't overwhelmed

I hope that Tom isn't bossy
I hope Tom isn't absent
I hope that Tom isn't absent
I hope it's well received
I hope that it's well received
I hope it doesn't come to that
I hope I didn't botch the job
I haven't killed anyone yet
I haven't killed anybody yet
I don't work as much as Tom
Was that a surprise to anyone?
Tom doesn't love anyone
Tom doesn't love anybody
Just don't tell anyone
I don't trust what anyone says
I don't let anyone touch me
I don't let anybody touch me
I didn't know I'd hurt anyone
I didn't know I'd hurt anybody
I didn't dare tell anyone
I didn't dare tell anybody
I don't think you're old
I don't think that you're old
I don't think you're cute
I don't think that you're cute
I don't think Tom is stoned
I don't think Tom is helpless
I don't think Tom is gone
I don't think that Tom is gone
I don't think Tom is deranged
I don't think Tom is deaf
I don't think that Tom is deaf
I don't think Tom is athletic
I don't think it hurts Tom
I don't think I'm very lucky
I don't think I'm unlucky
I don't think that I'm unlucky
I don't think I'm ugly
I don't think that I'm ugly
I don't think I'm adopted
I don't think that I'm adopted
I don't think I'll kiss Tom
I don't think I should sing
I didn't think you'd be crying
I didn't think Tom was annoyed
I didn't think Tom could win
I didn't know Tom was crying
I didn't know I should drive
I can't believe you confessed
I bet Tom won't laugh
I bet that Tom won't laugh
I assure you I won't be late
I assumed Tom wouldn't win
I guess that's not true
I guess that isn't true
I'm glad Tom is coming back
Next week I'll be in Boston
That's not what I really want
That isn't what I really want
Tom didn't use to do that
It'll be hard to replace Tom
The pay's not bad
The pay isn't bad
You'll have no problems
Tom didn't seem to be bothered
I thought Tom wouldn't sing
I don't work as hard as Tom
I don't think Tom will sing
I don't believe I know you
We're not too concerned
We aren't too concerned
Tom is a good-hearted guy
Tom doesn't deny laughing
Tom doesn't believe I won
Tom didn't worry about it
Tom didn't know who cried
Tom's mother is now dead
Tom wouldn't let us down
Tom won't likely be last
Tom won't likely be fair
I won't call Tom
Tom won't be pessimistic
Tom won't be disobedient
Tom won't be discouraged
I forgive you, Tom
I hope you can forgive me, too
Tom wasn't very troubled
Tom wasn't very ticklish
Tom wasn't very thrilled
Tom wasn't very offended
Tom wasn't very confused
Tom wasn't alone at home
Tom was Mary's last hope
Tom swore he'd never cry
Tom swore he'd kill Mary
Tom swears he didn't cry
I've read Tom's poems
Have you read them, too?
Tom still hasn't laughed
Tom should've been tired
Tom should've been early
Tom should've been angry
I won't do that again
Tom must've been serious
Tom must've been psyched
Tom must've been frantic
Tom looks like he's well
Tom looks like he's lost
Tom looks like he's glad
Tom knows Mary won't cry
I'd die if that happened to me
Tom knows I wouldn't cry
Tom isn't needed anymore
Tom is on duty, isn't he?
Tom is my first-born son
You're usually quite observant
You're a real pain in the neck
You're a pretty amazing person
You look like you're skeptical
You look like you're impatient
You look like you're dedicated
You look like you're concerned
You look like you're committed
Tom is an Asian-American
We didn't know how it would go
Let's go out and have some fun
I've never been given anything
I've already been fooled twice
I'm one step closer to my goal
I'm happy because you're happy
Tom is a part-time actor
I'm determined to go to Boston
I'd like to see you more often
I wasn't the one giving orders
I wasn't hurt in the explosion
I wasn't happy with what I saw
I don't want any of your money
I don't understand your French
I don't like to work by myself
I don't know the answer myself
I don't intend to go to Boston
I don't have to be asked twice
I don't have time to get bored
I don't have friends in Boston
I don't deserve to be punished
I didn't want the party to end
Tom didn't try to escape
I didn't understand the reason
I didn't think about it at all
Tom's kidneys shut down
I didn't mean to freak you out
I didn't know a thing about it
Tom's chest was crushed
I didn't hesitate for a moment
I didn't ask a single question
Tom's appeal was denied
I can't take all of the credit
I can't say I enjoyed the meal
Tom wouldn't forgive me
I can't picture you in a dress
I can't picture you doing that
Tom won't tolerate this
I can't help but be suspicious
I can't have any more children
Tom won't likely be out
Tom won't be supportive
You're the team's best scorer
You're a remarkable young man
Tom won't be displeased
You look like you're troubled
You know what I'd like to see?
You can't be sure it's not me
Would you rather speak French?
Will it ever become a reality?
Will I have to change doctors?
Will I be able to keep my job?
Which university do you go to?
Which job did you like better?
When will the report be ready?
What do you predict this year?
What do you do if you see one?
You can do that, Tom
We'll see each other tomorrow
We can't go to Boston anymore
Was it interesting doing that?
I'm really worried about that
I'm not making any guarantees
I'm here to fight for justice
I'm here to apply for the job
I'm going to be different now
I'm going back to look for it
I'm busy talking on the phone
I'm about to leave for Boston
I'll pretend it didn't happen
I'll go with you if necessary
I'd like to become a musician
I wonder if I'm hallucinating
Tom wasn't well-behaved
Tom wasn't very sincere
I tried, but couldn't do that
Tom wasn't very prudent
Tom wasn't sure of that
I don't want to become famous
I don't want the party to end
I don't want any part of this
I don't see it getting better
I don't normally go to Boston
I don't like to feel left out
I don't have any credit cards
I don't dare to open my mouth
I didn't want you at my party
I didn't listen to my parents
I can't wait to work with you
I can't pick you up at school
I can't leave you by yourself
I can't come to Boston either
You're well paid, aren't you?
You look like you're relaxed
You look like you're anxious
You got your way, didn't you?
Would you go along with that?
Will you do something for me?
Why is this allowed to go on?
Who gave you this assignment?
Tom swore he didn't cry
Who do you think hugged Mary?
What kind of place is Boston?
Tom swears he won't cry
What do you deduce from that?
Was the train going too fast?
Was that part of the problem?
Tom should've never won
I've put off going to Boston
Tom should've been fine
I'm puzzled about what to do
I'm not going to lie for you
I'm not going to change that
I'm about to lose everything
I'll protect you from danger
I'll be there, rain or shine
I'd like to see that changed
I wish you wouldn't sing now
I wasn't fooled for a second
I just think it's disgusting
I don't need to study French
I don't need to prove myself
I don't like to stay at home
I don't like to share things
I don't care about my grades
I didn't want to be a snitch
Tom must've been insane
I didn't want to appear weak
I didn't wait another second
Tom must've already won
I didn't really see anything
I didn't go out last weekend
I didn't deserve to be fired
I didn't buy those arguments
I can't remember ever crying
I can't do that in this heat
You're involved, aren't you?
You're a snotty little brat
You're a shrewd businessman
You got creamed, didn't you?
Will you be able to make it?
Tom isn't right for you
Will my signature be enough?
Will it matter if I do that?
Why are you so irresistible?
Why are you so disorganized?
Who's the company president?
Who are the real terrorists?
What's that a photograph of?
What were you in Boston for?
What might happen this year?
What is a recession exactly?
What good is that to us now?
What does that matter to us?
Well, shall we do that, too?
We're starting from scratch
We're short of three chairs
We're part of the community
We're getting tired of them
I've already figured it out
I'm working on another book
I'm waiting for you at home
I'm usually quite observant
I'm trying not to freak out
I'm quite happy to stay put
I'm not getting in your car
I'm here to fight for peace
I'm aware of the challenges
I'm a taxi driver in Boston
I'll set this aside for you
I'll grant you three wishes
I'd never study French here
I'd like to know the answer
Tom is Mary's sole heir
I wasn't hurt in the attack
I know where you're staying
I just don't feel safe here
I had a run-in with my boss
I don't want to pay in cash
I don't want to be a snitch
I don't want to appear weak
I don't like people who lie
I don't know what awaits me
I didn't vote on the motion
I didn't try to do anything
I didn't make it any better
I didn't know you'd tell me
Tom doesn't look normal
I didn't go to the hospital
I didn't do enough research
I didn't dare open my mouth
I can't picture you dancing
Tom, too, will do that
I can't help but be jealous
I can't afford to be choosy
Tom's trial isn't over
Tom wouldn't be afraid
Do you have any last wishes?
Tom won't likely be OK
You're very well respected
You're very impressionable
Tom won't be suspended
You're always disappointed
You'd be bad at doing that
Tom won't be skeptical
Tom won't be depressed
You look like you're tough
Tom won't be concerned
Will this strategy succeed?
Why are you so unambitious?
Why are you so thickheaded?
Why are you so influential?
Why are you being so nosey?
Who's going to sing for us?
Who shall I say is calling?
What can you say in French?
We've proven that it works
We just couldn't finish it
We don't need more studies
I've had a change of heart
I'm well aware of the odds
I'm under extreme pressure
I'm the only one who knows
I'm standing on the bridge
I'm sorry I went to Boston
I'm sorry I came to Boston
I'm really bad at swimming
I'm ready to defend myself
I'm out of my element here
I'm not where I want to be
I'm not really into sports
I'm not quite myself today
I'm a stranger around here
I'll never ever sing again
I'll be eternally grateful

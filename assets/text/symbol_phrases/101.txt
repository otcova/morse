I believe that he'll do fine
He's sure to help you
What did he do yesterday?
Is he any better today?
He's gonna get axed
He doesn't let Kate drink wine
He doesn't like coffee
He's just an ordinary student
He isn't here, is he?
How did he come by this money?
Does he live near here?
He's a student at this college
He's a member of the golf club
He's smoking more than ever
He doesn't eat this, does he?
He can't walk any more
He likes jazz, and so do I
He is really a queer fellow!
He'll soon catch up with Tom
He'll be back in a minute
Will he come home soon?
Will he get well soon?
He doesn't mince words
He's all excited
He's keeping a straight face
He will pay 20 dollars at most
He has at most 100 dollars
He isn't happy at all
He didn't go there
Didn't he go there?
He went there, never to return
He didn't go there
Did he go there?
We'd better leave him alone
Did he not laugh then?
He wouldn't mention the plan
Is he in favor of the plan?
He didn't give up the plan
What has become of him?
He paid $20 for the lipstick
He didn't go for the idea
He didn't catch the signal
Is he aware of the difficulty?
He doesn't turn to that work
Did he mention the accident?
He wasn't watching TV then
He looked into the boy's eyes
How did he take the news?
He's living from hand to mouth
He hasn't read the book yet
Did he undertake the mission?
I'm afraid that he can't do it
He doesn't know any better
He didn't say a word about it
He asked $5 for it
He isn't as honest as all that
He did it, and in her presence

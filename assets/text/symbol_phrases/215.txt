Is it simple enough?
Tom is a singer-songwriter
What was Tom singing?
This is a no-win situation
It's a volatile situation
It's a unique situation
Where will everybody sleep?
Why are they sleeping?
What's that awful smell?
It sounds easy, but it's not
What sparked the idea?
Strictly speaking, that's true
Can you really speak French?
It'll be special
You've spoiled everything
Who spread those rumors?
Why are they stalling?
Can you stand the pain?
Tom's trial starts tomorrow
Dinner starts at 6:00 p.m
Who started all this?
Should we start now?
We've just started
We started in 2013
Why not start now?
Who should start?
Tom will stay, but Mary won't
Should Tom have stayed?
Tom should've stayed
Why are you staying?
Are you stuck?
Why can't they be stopped?
Can anybody stop them?
Can anyone stop Tom?
Why should we stop?
You'll be stopped
We have 13 retail stores
It's been a struggle
How successful were they?
How can you succeed?
What are they suggesting?
Would that be suitable?
Who was Tom's supervisor?
We support Tom's decision
Was anyone really surprised?
You shouldn't be surprised
Why were you so surprised?
Why is anybody surprised?
Well, this is a surprise
It wasn't a big surprise
Why is anyone surprised?
Are we really surprised?
It's hardly surprising
What a happy surprise!
You'll be surprised
Fortunately, Tom survived
There were 30 survivors
How will you survive?
Would you take that away?
Are you taking pictures?
Take your time, folks
Who will teach our children?
Tom was Mary's teacher
It's just a phone
They're terrified of you
Thanks for everything, Tom
Thank you again, Tom
Here's some food for thought
We think that's wrong
What a great thought!
Where is your tie?
You'll have a marvelous time
There's still plenty of time
We're wasting a lot of time
Is now an appropriate time?
Tom was stabbed 13 times
Is time travel possible?
Tom was 13 at the time
It's a full-time job
Tom was, of course, very tired
We're all tired
Who trained the trainers?
How would you translate this?
How would you translate it?
We're being treated fairly
Are they treated fairly?
Everyone's in trouble
Should we really trust them?
Can Australia be trusted?
We trust Tom's opinion
Would you trust them?
Can we trust anyone?
Who can we trust?
We should've tried harder
Have you tried sushi?
Now it's Tom's turn
It was Tom's turn
You're not Tom's type
It's a massive undertaking
Why was Tom so upset?
Why aren't you upset?
Was Tom upset, too?
Why is Tom upset?
Why not use robots?
Who else uses it?
We'll visit Boston tomorrow
We'll visit you soon
Have you voted yet?
This can't wait until tomorrow
Are we still waiting for Tom?
Is someone waiting for you?
Why wait until Monday?
Why is Tom waiting?
It was heart-warming
You've been warned twice
It's such a waste
Are we being watched?
Were they wearing seatbelts?
Tom wasn't wearing anything
Tom wasn't wearing a helmet
What were they wearing?
Welcome to Boston, everybody
Welcome to Boston, Tom
We won't tolerate any looting
Bullying won't be tolerated
That still won't be enough
Everyone can't be a winner
Now, this won't be easy
You've won the lottery
We won't be silenced
They haven't won yet
Winning wasn't easy
Who was the winner?
We won't be silent
Of course, Tom won
Tom should've won
We'd better win
There were 30 witnesses
Who are the witnesses?
No wonder you're worried
No wonder you're frantic
The elevators aren't working
We should've worked harder
Are the elevators working?
We're still working hard
It's great working here
We've worked hard
No one's working
Maybe it'll work
It'll work fine
Why aren't they worried?
What are your worries?
Should Tom be worried?
Should we be worried?
Why worry about Tom?
Why worry about it?
This is a well-written article
Who wrote these stories?
I noticed her, too
I'm a regular at this gym
Do you need help moving?
He's left-handed
He's not discontented
He's just tired
They won't accept the gifts
I've forgotten the name
I love you, Mama
Who is worried about Tom?
He swept to power in 1929
A man's penis controls him
I said, "that's enough!
I've said enough
Where is the gas station?
Where is the petrol station?
She's scratching her hand
Mary doesn't love Tom
Are you single?
What city do you live in?
OK, I'll order them
I didn't order them
I've already ordered them
Can you order them for me?
I'm sanding the shed today
I don't believe in you
I can't
I'm still eating
I'm boiling with anger
OK, I'll bite
I'm sorry
We're no longer children
That black bag is yours?
I'm leaving tonight.
Don't give me that!
Tom's voice is so sexy!
It's rubbish!
You are religious, right?
I think that's your car
It's started raining
Now set my heart on fire!
Do you guys like horses?
They won't have arrived yet
He wouldn't give you anything
What's wrong with that woman?
She's seeing someone else
What does that girl look like?
She was very fun-loving
I'm worried something is amiss
She frantically dialled 911
She couldn't handle it anymore
She can't make that decision
There's nothing I fear more
I'm not waiting for you
I can't wear that.
Why not?
It looks great on you.
You want me to cook for you?
Mice don't have grandchildren
A day has 86,400 seconds
Who was she hanging out with?
She didn't feel well
For her, the honeymoon is over
She was a gorgeous girl of 22
She wasn't badly hurt
We're splitting the bill
I don't believe that story
Mary is Tom's step-sister
Tom doesn't seem like a boy
Sorry I didn't reply
I'm jealous of your height.
Really?
It's alright if you can't sing
Tom's eyes are powerful
There is power in Tom's eyes
It must be great to be tall.
Do you think so?
It's not really that great
Is my software up-to-date?
Your software is up-to-date
Can you update our software?
Can you update the software?
Can you update my software?
Would you update my software?
Was my software updated?
Has my software been updated?
She is not animal-loving
What is a planetary year?
The pilot is 30 years old
The pilot is 30 years of age
Where are my sentences?
Where are her sentences?
Where are your sentences?
She wasn't looking for love
Why can't you just be normal?
Do we really have to go back?
Hi!
I'd like to eat something
Do you want to play something?
What planet do you live on?
We're one player short
Neko mimi characters are cute!
So, you giving up?
She wasn't ready for marriage
She didn't press him
Look, he's approaching
Have you ever seen a swift?
Tom high-fived his friend
It's you I'm worried about
Where are they swimming?
My tail hurts!
What's your favorite food?
What did you have for lunch?
What did you have for dinner?
I'm a friend of Roberto's
You don't know the whole story
Can you empty the dishwasher?
It's supposed to be fun
I can't believe he's single
Are you going home now?
What is this red food called?
If you get sleepy, tell me
If you get sleepy, let me know
What happened?
Are you saying I'm impolite?
Why do it this way?
I'll see her tomorrow
Can I come in now?
Keep your dirty hands off me!
I can't stand violence
Go on, Tom, I'm listening
Go on, Tom, we're listening
You like cats, don't you?
Water freezes at 0Â° C
Where is my food?
Would you like some?
I'll eat some too
How interesting is that!
How cool is that!
How awesome is that!
I love sports, too
Tom, what sports do you like?
After work, I went to exercise
Six squared is thirty-six
Come back soon!
It seems I've offended you
You've been amazingly tolerant
You should follow Tom's advice
We're proud of our achievement
Tom's acceptance speech was OK
Tom would've heartily agreed
Tom says that isn't acceptable
This wasn't an easy assignment
That's quite an accomplishment
That's a pretty big assumption
Surprisingly, I agree with Tom
It's actually kind of annoying
It's a very serious allegation
I've already apologized to Tom
I'm sure they'll appreciate it
I didn't ask Tom that question
I can't afford to go to school
About 300 people were arrested
Would that be more acceptable?
We're not asking for anything
Tom's parents are out of town
Tom's answer was very evasive
Tom's answer may surprise you
Tom might know Mary's address
Tom is Mary's adopted brother
Tom doesn't want to apologize
Tom didn't sign the agreement
Tom assured us he'd cooperate
Tom acknowledges it's not fun
Today, you might get arrested
There's a lot of anticipation
That's no reason to apologize
Over 300 people were arrested
OK, let's assume you're right
Mr. Jackson teaches us French
Most people won't be affected
Look, I'm trying to apologize
It's fun to hang out with Tom
I've known Tom for many years
I don't think they allow that
I assume that's what you want
How will that be accomplished?
How can we afford all of this?
Don't ask me to do that again
Does that answer the question?
Do you keep in touch with Tom?
Did that answer your question?
You've done an admirable job
Would you accept those terms?
Will I receive financial aid?
Why do you hang out with Tom?
What's that going to achieve?
What has Tom been accused of?
We're not abusing the system
We weren't allowed backstage
We do everything we're asked
We can't afford that anymore
Tom wouldn't agree with this
Tom should've told the truth
Tom hasn't yet been arrested
Tom doesn't need your advice
Tom didn't hesitate to agree
Tom can't afford that luxury
They're trained in first aid
The police didn't arrest Tom
The experts were amazed, too
The answer to that's obvious
That's an abuse of authority
That's a huge accomplishment
That'll be a big achievement
That isn't acceptable to Tom
Mr. Jackson is our principal
Let me answer Tom's question
It's difficult to please Tom
It's been an amazing journey
It's amazing I'm still alive
I thought you'd never arrive
I don't think that's allowed
How does one achieve success?
How can we achieve that goal?
How can this be accomplished?
Did you anticipate that, too?
I don't know," admitted Tom
Who cares who appointed Tom?
Who can afford this anymore?
Who can afford these prices?
What part do you agree with?
We've already achieved that
We're still as busy as ever
We can't afford another war
Tom is now Mary's assistant
Tom didn't ask for anything
Tom didn't answer his phone
They're going to arrest you
That's quite an achievement
That strategy hasn't worked
It's not easy to please Tom
It's an amazing opportunity
It doesn't really affect me
I'm not asking for anything
I think that's unacceptable
I shouldn't have asked that
I didn't ask you to do this
I can't accept your apology
I agree with Tom's comments
How many firemen were there?
How did you accomplish that?
How did Tom accomplish that?
You like Boston, don't you?
Won't Tom be busy tomorrow?
Who does Tom hang out with?
When will Tom go to Boston?
What action should we take?
We weren't allowed to talk
We simply can't allow that
Was that a fair assessment?
Was Tom at home last night?
Tom thinks he's a big shot
Tom didn't approve of that
Tom could be affected, too
Those numbers don't add up
The answer isn't yet clear
That's what I'm asking you
It really didn't affect us
Is that what you're asking?
I'm sure Tom can afford it
I'm not apologizing to you
I won't accept these gifts
I think it's quite amusing
I don't know those answers
I don't apologize for that
I couldn't afford a lawyer
I agree with Tom's opinion
How can we accomplish that?
Does that affect the price?
It was boring," Tom added
You're allowed to do that
Would you agree with that?
Who could argue with that?
We can't abandon them now
Tom admits he wasn't sure
There's a car approaching
That's the correct answer
That's not annoying to me
It's been an amazing year
It's an absurd allegation
I guess I'm well adjusted
I guess I'm easily amused
I don't have your address
I don't disagree with Tom
I couldn't help but agree
Clearly, the answer is no
Can we afford to buy that?
We didn't get an apology
Was it acceptable to you?
Tom, I disagree with you
Tom was arrested in 2013
Tom didn't enjoy his job
Tom didn't argue with me
Tom couldn't answer Mary
There's no simple answer
That's no longer allowed
Pets aren't allowed here
Other than that, I agree
Let's not argue about it
It simply doesn't add up
It didn't just affect me
I've arranged everything
I'm not an actor anymore
I wouldn't agree to that
I won't argue that point
I disagree with you, Tom
I didn't agree with that
How will this affect you?
How does this affect you?
How can this be achieved?
Can we afford to do that?
Ask Tom how he's feeling
Anyway, I agree with Tom
Would Tom agree to this?
Why wasn't Tom arrested?
Why did they arrest Tom?
Who else agrees with me?
What was Tom accused of?
What sort of man is Tom?
What else would you add?
Tom won't agree to that
Tom shouldn't have lied
Tom doesn't like onions
That's a bad assumption
It's too heavy to carry
I'm not allowed to talk
I'm not advocating that
I'm amazed I'm not dead
I don't know the answer
I don't agree with them
I didn't argue with Tom
I can't afford the fees
How will this affect us?
How does this affect me?
How did that affect you?
Don't ask me that again
Are you annoyed by this?
Who asked you for help?
We don't approve of it
Was Tom asked to leave?
Tom isn't a good actor
Tom agrees that's true
It's too heavy to move
It's an abuse of power
It's a big achievement
It just doesn't add up
Is this really allowed?
I've come to apologize
I'm glad we agree, Tom
I don't enjoy swimming
How often do you shave?
Do you shave every day?
Do you have the answer?
Do you agree with this?
Who asked you to help?
That's not the answer
I'll see Tom tomorrow
I don't approve of it
I don't agree with it
I agree with you, Tom
I agree with Tom, too
I agree it's not easy
How many of you agree?
Your plan won't work
Won't Tom be annoyed?
We're really touched
It's time to act now
It's now time to act
Is it an action movie?
I don't enjoy skiing
I don't enjoy acting
You're all adorable
Tom wasn't arrested
That's pretty brave
That's a lot to ask
I can't add that up
It's very exciting
Has Tom called yet?
Tom wasn't amused
Tom didn't appear
It's just amazing
It's going fine
I'm very lazy
Huh?
What secret?
I'm contemplating this option
Eat while it's warm
We'll share our food with them
Whose lunch box is this?
I don't know any martial arts
Today's Tom's birthday
Did you do it by yourselves?
He's a screenwriter
When did you come to China?
Did you dye your hair?
Does Tom dye his hair?
Why do people dye their hair?
May I come again?
Did you put on sunscreen?
Have you put on sunscreen?
I'm sorry I'm so stupid
I'd like a shot of tequila
How long do butterflies live?
What is a chord progression?
So far I've written five songs
Get out of my room, Tom!
Get out of my room!
Get out now!
Why are you standing there?
Am I that transparent?
Tom read a self-help book
Tom, you're a liar
That's not exactly what I said
You were just acting?
Will you be much longer?
I'm busy, so I can't help
How I miss you!
Those who know and can, do
Then what does it mean?
What are they drinking?
Is he feeling better today?
I want to greet him, too
I'll come see you
Sad!
Tomorrow's payday
I'd like to hug you naked
Were you home yesterday?
Good, as always
He's closing everything
She's closing everything
You should have come see us!
Come say "hi" to me!
Don't listen to this man
But isn't he above the law?
It was a great pleasure!
How was I dressed then?
Do you remember?
MadrileÃ±os are crazy
Let's put it like that!
In the same way?
How many soldiers fought?
It's impolite to point
Attention doesn't hurt
What did he reply to them?
I'm not setting them any traps
Man, he's a good liar
Don't talk while you're eating
Did he tell you why he did it?
Tom makes a shit-ton of dough
He's the cause of all this
Have pity on me!
He's read a lot of books
Prove you're brave
Show me you're brave
I'm gonna fuck Tom up
I've just arrived
This proves everything!
How do computers work?
She ran to her room, crying
My sister is in love with you.
What?
That's what my mom said
What a large town!
You know what I hate?
That's my favorite excuse
Dan didn't even feel ashamed
What's the chord progression?
We've had enough of that
I'm going home
I've had enough of Tom
I'm going back to Boston
I've had enough of Chicago
I've had enough of your lying
Today, I will dine with you
How I hate him!
God, please send us the sun!
I'll go there by plane
I'm going in the museum
You're not paying attention!
Such is life!
Have pity on us!
I didn't hear any sounds
It was time he did it!
I know more than 100 words
Yes, she was a shy girl
Where is the bread?
She didn't like being poor
It's true that you're wrong
They're joking
It's as American as apple pie
I'll never see Tom ever again
God doesn't make mistakes
Oops!
My finger slipped!
Is Mother going to the store?
My father-in-law is sitting
Can usernames be changed?
Do you know where Holly is?
I'm sorry!
Is there water there?
Who broke the bottle?
Today, I'm in a bad mood
It's really dark here
I can't see anything
We're closed today
I don't know where he is!
Who is your father?
Choose the right word!
May it grow!
I'm a total loser
Let's ask her
I'd like to renovate the house
Eyes front, please
Faster, Tom
Don't play the ape!
She didn't write me back
He didn't write me back
I'm not into Asian guys
Have you tried online dating?
Tatoeba Day starts now!
I can't permit this
Is there a metro station here?
It's the same here
She's my chief assistant
Are you looking at a crown?
What do you do after dinner?
We don't have any bread left
He's the enemy
Don't you understand?
We'll topple this dictatorship
Why was my father so mean?
Make sure you're there by 2:30
It's all downhill from here
Do you have a point card?
The boss doesn't know it yet
Could you prepare the salad?
I acted like I didn't know her
I acted like I didn't know him
It's a shame to be Russian
Tom's a big, fat slob
It's just a cover
We couldn't hide our tracks
I'm not a robot
What an idiot you are!
It's not a beauty contest
You're new, aren't you?
I think Tom still hasn't left
You won't disobey me
Have you called me?
They're building a new plaza
I don't know at all
I don't understand at all
I don't have any money at all
He can't add sentences
Do we need anything else?
Are we missing anything else?
What are you calling me for?
What are you calling me for?
Mom doesn't like to exercise
Tom doesn't like to exercise
Don't celebrate too soon!
I'm glad you're over your cold
I'm not good at lying
We're just friends
Can I open my eyes?
Come on, what's her name?
Come on, what's his name?
This was your idea, wasn't it?
I don't want to miss the party
Well, what are you singing?
Did Tom die in that accident?
Where did you go last weekend?
That was Tom's idea, not mine
Don't blame me
Are you Choctaw?
Does he want to see it?
That's what I asked
She hates it?
Yes.
I hate it, too.
What do you suggest I do then?
Would you like to stay longer?
She isn't what you think
It isn't what you're thinking
What in the world is that?
Free Palestine!
I'm not arguing with that
Is it a son or a daughter?
It's still bright outside
I'm too busy to go there
I can't go because I am busy
When are you going to call?
Can you pass me the towel?
Do you need a bag?
It's suspicious
It is Jack's apple
Which ones are Tom's?
I'm not much of a cook
I'm not much of a drinker
He's losing too much blood
If you're a man, you take it
I'm very fearful of death
Tom's fingers are greasy
Tom's hands are greasy
Can you pull me out of here?
Do you like noodles with beef?
You're a unicorn
That's why I'm smiling
Don't say that behind my back
Excuse me, where is the metro?
Let's go by taxi
How can I return home?
Remain there and don't move
This dog runs very fast!
You're just making stuff up
This bridge won't last long
I knocked him down by $20
It's turtles all the way down
Good grief!
He didn't even look at me
She didn't even look at me
What is it?
Don't worry
Let's party forever
You're watching Tatoeba TV
I'll play tennis this evening
Don't sic a dog
Don't get a dog riled up
He is sick, it seems
Double or nothing?
Tom is very good-hearted
Tom is good-hearted
Where are we going now?
To the theatre or the cinema?
I didn't cry out
I didn't yell
This bus doesn't stop here
Is there an elevator here?
Do you have an elevator?
I wanted to go, but I forgot
I was bored, so I fell asleep
I'd rather Tom do it
The man isn't made for this
Can I talk to Mike?
Why don't we go to see a film?
Whose daughter is Julia?
Tom couldn't talk to Mary
I can't hear what she's saying
Could you wake me up at seven?
She's not confident
I saw Marcus' house
I don't like how he laughs
Tom respected Mary's chastity
Tom stayed in Mary's house
Tom wasn't used to failure
Tom used Mary's credit cards
For Tom, life was perfect
Tom remained in Mary's radar
How many wives have you had?
But I'm a toon
Please tell me it's not true
That's too much information
We can't just leave him here
We can't just leave her here
It won't happen again, I swear
How do helicopters fly?
How do birds fly?
This is Tom's notebook
Are you an adult or a child?
It's dark in my imagination
Tom's only got eyes for Mary
He's responsible for that
The girls don't like that song
They canât dance
Who else knew about it?
Who else knows about it?
How did that get in there?
Are you here on holiday?
Tom's given to fits of rage
What happened to your dog?
Where did everyone else go?
I'm going to go get dressed
I'm going to go take a shower
Don't cry because it's over
Do you know who you are?
She's demanding too much
I'm not trying to be sarcastic
Oh!
Why me?!
Honestly, that wasn't my aim
Wow!", I thought!
I need eyes here!
Tom double-crossed me
It's funny you should say so
She's pretty, isn't she?
She was pretty, wasn't she?
Why do you say that he's liar?
Because she is.
What?
It's time to call it quits
Don't give away all my secrets
What a fool I am!
You will let her stay?
Everyone's in position
I don't make excuses
I'm heading to bed now
It's sarcasm at its finest!
Good night and sleep tight!
What am I?
OK, I'll buy a car tomorrow!
What if I don't buy that car?
They won't help us..
Oh, fine!
I'll give it one more go!
But that's it!
Is Gibraltar a country?
Guys, we need to talk
Do not come back, OK?
Yes, it's over there
I can't do it, sorry
Is he a magician?
She's not even really pretty
If you don't sleep, you'll die
C'mon, let's eat something!
Don't work too much, OK?
She's Mary's sister-in-law
That's right, easy does it
I'm nothing more than myself
Holy mackerel!
Is that a shark?
Hahaha!
It's music to my ears
Tom, will you get up?
There's lots of work involved
I'm going to take a break now
Ha!
I love your sense of humour.
'Where do you come from?'
Our king has come back!
What the fuck did he just do?!
Get out of here, now!
Are they real or fake?
Are the pearls real or fake?
Are her boobs real or fake?
Is this diamond real or fake?
Of course, I'm serious!
Is it not written on my face?
She's an airhead
Tom, I'm shot real bad
Do not weep, child
Are you off for your date?
Listen to me, my ball, my ball
'Now we are safe,' cried she
What a horrible dream!
How bad do I look?
Will you pay?
Could you dust the table?
You're not that scary
It wouldn't make sense
What did he do?
That's worth a lot to me
Let's go out on the balcony
Are you free tomorrow night?
He is nearly 40
Take this, honey
You have to trust me, honey!
I can't do it, bro
I'm really sorry
He's at the next corner
I don't ever try to be sloppy
I'm telling you for certain!
I'm late again
I'm not following you at all
Can you break it down for me?
I don't know how Tom found out
I don't know how she found out
Don't make a show of yourself
Seriously, go jump in a lake!
I'm opening the door
He's not just useless either
He's lost his mind!
Zip it Tom!
Zip it!
Lock it!
And put it in your pocket!
I just had a flash of genius!
We need to round up a crew!
You betcha!
Yeppers!
I'll work hard
He's trying hard
They're sheeple
But in practice, they're messy
I'll show you who's in charge!
I've just been robbed
Can you do that for me?
I guess so.
Or is it a fear of flying?
I'll be awake the whole night
Yippee!
The feeling's mutual
No, I just can't remember
You're pathetic
Why did you do it, Tom?
Hi there!
Where?
Goodbye everyone!
Stop acting like this Tom!
I'm tired of this nonsense!
No!
I'm not a charity!
Go on, but in Finnish
No wonder he couldn't sleep.
It's been a terrible day
We don't care what they say
I can help, if you want
What was I gonna say?
What was I going to say?
Set me free!
How did you find Egypt?
Hot.
It's not like the 1940's
Why was I not informed?
Does it hurt here?
Where does it hurt?
Everywhere.
You're hard-headed!
I was hungry, so I ate
I was hungry, so I ate it
I should've gone home
I think it'll be OK

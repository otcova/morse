I'm certain of it
You've gotta be strong.
They melt in your mouth!
They don't wanna let me go
The video isn't available
I'll join y'all later
I do the dragon's voice
There's a pond in the park
Stop kowtowing to China!
Have you ever kissed your dog?
To whom are you talking?
I don't find that necessary
Don't call me ever again
And now, I'm free
Yes, it's that easy
Nice suit.
My mom made it for me.
Did she now?
Let's buy her one
He's driving to the hospital
I can't understand Maths
What's his face?
See you later, Mary!
They're all delicious!
I sit at the pew, centre right
It is $14
She's a seamstress
May I escort you?
In reality, it was a mirage
Why is Tom shouting at them?
They're tacky
It's pouring down!
Well, not always
Do you intend to dance today?
Who are the men?
The US can't protect Taiwan
The US won't protect Taiwan
Taiwan will be China's
China isn't scared of the US
China isn't afraid of war
Welcome to the Internet!
Who arrived last?
Is water available there?
He's in hospital in ICU
I took the A58
He's totally smitten with you
Why did you two split up?
You're needed here in hospital
Jog on!
He's already packed his bags
She's already packed her bags
Was she there?
Was he there?
We haven't got enough beds
We don't have enough beds
After Thursday, it's Friday
You're dumber than I thought
Death to the invader!
I'd go crazy if you left me
You're scared?
He'll be surprised
You got everything?
He staggered left, then right
That's all he said
Let there be peace!
War?
Nuclear war?
Don't tell me you're scared?
Don't tell me you're afraid?
How much rejoicing there was!
Won't he be surprised?
How surprised he'll be!
I don't feel hungry right now
I don't feel tired right now
I don't feel sleepy
I'm nothing like my father
We'll help you for free
Do you have family here?
I'll get you something to eat
Where can I take a shower?
I'd like to take a shower
When do I have to come back?
When do I need to come back?
When should I come back?
What do you mean?
Do you understand Polish?
What faith are you?
I don't have a mobile phone
Don't give money to anyone
Where can I pray?
You'll get a hot meal there
I don't know where my dad is
I don't know where my mom is
What is your child's name?
What's your child's name?
Can these people be trusted?
Don't separate from each other
I'll get back to you shortly
I'll be right back with you
Congratulations!
Do you have food?
Can you give me a sandwich?
Wait 'til we see..
I'm atoning for my sins
Coincidence?
I don't think so
I hope I'm dead wrong
I've got toothache
We'll help you for nothing
I've got tuberculosis
Wait in the queue, please
Are you taking any medicine?
Are you on medication?
I don't know where my mum is
I haven't got any money
I haven't got a mobile
I don't have a mobile
I haven't got a mobile phone
I've got diabetes
I've got asthma
It's a cinch
Don't lose sight of each other
Is Tom's lawyer good?
Let's help Tom, OK?
Tom won't believe us, will he?
I don't have to go yet
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow
I have to admit that's true
What exactly did I get wrong?
What exactly did I do wrong?
Our proposal wasn't accepted
It's the bee's knees
Well, who's next?
Thereof, he is not so sure
I'm not jealous of his past
You've never lacked for women
By now, things have changed
I've always found Tom weird
Get the idea?
Don’t tease your brother
There is a children's playroom
Can you help me find Tom?
Nice cock!
I think I'm about to cum
Oh yeah, just like that
Don’t stop it now, Tang
Oh God, I'm coming!
Jesus, I'm exhausted
I've never voted for Putin
I'm waiting for a letter
I'm waiting for the letter
I'm expecting a letter
What do you need, old man?
Doctor, can this be treated?
Let's not today, OK?
How are you?
Is your head spinning?
How are you?
Are you dizzy?
Let's not do that today, OK?
Let's not do this anymore, OK?
Let's not throw this away
Let's not keep anyone waiting
Let's not tell anyone
Let's not tell Tom
Let's not tell Tom what we did
Let's not use that anymore
Let's not use these
Let's not panic, OK?
Let's not panic yet
Let's not panic just yet
Let's not say anything
Let's not say goodbye yet
Let's not think about that now
Let's not confuse ourselves
Let's not confuse the issue
It's bound to happen some day
Let's not forget anything
Let's not forget Tom
Let's not forget our umbrellas
Let's not get over-confident
Let's not get this wrong
Let's not get into that now
Let's not go home right away
Let's not go there again
Let's not go too fast
Let's not go any further
Let's not make this a big deal
Meow!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Let's not make a habit of it
France is the world champion!
Way to go, France!
Let's not make this any worse
Moo!

Let's not let Tom down
Let's not let that happen here
Let's not let this go to waste
Let's not let them hear us
Let's not let them see us
Let's not let Tom escape
This takes from 2 to 3 minutes
Let's not let it bother us
Let's not waste another second
Let's not waste another minute
Let's not waste any time
Let's not waste Tom's time
Let's not lose track of time
Let's not lose our focus
Let's not lose our heads

Let's not worry about Tom
Let's not start with that
Let's not start yet
Let's not give up
Let's not give up now
Let's not give up yet
Let's not give Tom anything
Let's not give up hope
Let's not worry about it, OK?
Let's not fight anymore
Let's not fight about it
Let's not take any chances
Let's not take that risk
Let's not take this personally
Let's not play this game today
Let's not play cards tonight
Let's not play the blame game
You're absolute selfishness
He's been all over the world
Can you fix our drain?
Hello.
Coffee.
What do you want?
Coffee.
Don't drown
Of course we didn't mean that
Quack quack!
Do you like my plates?

I'll be missing you
You won't be missed!
Imagine there's no heaven
Imagine there's no countries
I'll do anything to help you
I forgot your brother's name
What was it again?
Can it be phrased another way?
How long has she been ill?
I've got to go shopping
I've got to do some shopping
Can I trust those people?
I'll ring you beforehand
I'll phone you beforehand
I'll telephone you beforehand
Will you help me find my son?
Where can I charge my phone?
I'd like to charge my phone
Are you coming to Brazil?
I'll wait here with you

It's written in English
Whose lorry is this?
Who does this lorry belong to?
Does this shop sell bread?
How many children were born?
How many babies were born?
Do you sell bread here?
Do you sell bread?
When can I ring you?
When can I phone you?
When can I telephone you?
I've just found them
I've just found her
I've just found it
I've just found him
I've just moved here
I'm having a bath
Is everything all right, Tom?
I've just heard from Tom
Coward!
Lazy boy!
I know what you did, you bitch
Don't take it
May I please have a mask?
Where can we find food?
Do you need gloves?
I hear you're a tough guy
Is the garment in the closet?
I'm looking for my parents
I'm looking for my father
I'm looking for my mother
Do you often get snow here?
But when I do, I don't
The truth can't be concealed
Who told you this news?
And how are things in Boston?
He's in high spirits today
He's a good fellow at heart
Long live Russia!
Can Algeria green its desert?
You made a beautiful gesture!
I see you've quit smoking
Are you Algerian citizens?
Of course!
Ziri for president!
Did you bring the couscous?
Let's try the couscous
Maybe I'm a little jealous
I'm meant to be alone
I'd have given my life for you
We're both aware of this
No, that's not the case at all
How far away is the border?
How can I get to the border?
You're my flower
Is Zelensky a homosexual?
Don't ask!
Where can we sit down?
I'll give you twice the cost
Do you like my ring?
I saw what you're doing
It’s kind of a good luck charm
I'm 21 right now
It's a question of security
It's a matter of security
I'm sure he'll be very pleased
I'll be back at six o'clock
I'll carry your suitcases
We don't know where Mary lives
I'm seeking asylum
When is it going to stop?
I think I'll go to sleep
She didn't turn up
You mustn't eat too much
First, he went to the station
When should I ring back?
When should I phone back?
I'm fed up with surprises
We don't even have a hammer
Do you see a person?
Tom, come with me
C'mon man
This task is easy-peasy
Drop by anytime you're in town
I don't belive in atheists
You shouldn't read this book
Can someone teach me trumpet?
That's the best part!
Oh wow, you're so right!
Thank you!
Many people don't know this
It's 2 A.M. and I'm high
High on life, that is
I don't do drugs
The Japanese didn't lose WWII
I'll give you a reply tomorrow
You'll get an answer tomorrow
Who'll defend Tom?
We don't know where Tom lives
How should I help Tom?
Can I try these shoes on?
Can I try on these shoes?
I'm coming down
This isn't a gimmick
I'm the sole survivor
I'm the only survivor
Can you shut up for a minute?
There's no parking space
Being nice doesn't pay off
I've kept you as a gentleman
Tom's family fled the country
It hurts me!
Hop!
Stay there!
He's sleeping like a rabbit
I'm glad!
How's that?
I can't hear!
Have you made a choice?
I suspected it!
A pleasure!
I'm following a Swiss
Open your eyes!
I'm a Swiss
It's nice here
The exam is on Sunday!
In your dream!
Where are my felt boots?
Do you like croque-monsieurs?
Bonjour, monsieur, bonjour!
What did he say?
“Something about a lampshade.”
Are you crazy?!
In the desert, there are oases
He's tracking him down
He's stalking him
Want to sell the parrot?
I'm not going to argue further
And what about us, Ukrainians?
Don't you?
Thanks, Tom
Why?
Do you have Instagram?
Do you have Insta?
You got Insta?
It is the 5th of June of 2013
It is the 6th of July of 2013
Why do I never get mentioned?
Should we listen, or not?
Where do you usually swim?
When do I have to come back?
This isn't comforting
I promise I won't peek
Whose watch is this?
Let me talk to her!
Will this affect tourism?
I certainly didn't say that
I definitely didn't say that
I didn't get any feedback
That's great feedback
Why are people not honest?
Such people actually exist?
I hear voices when I'm alone
I feel like I'm being watched
I've been raped
Who wouldn't wanna be rich?
Also, its simplicity is better
Are you sure about that?
I'm sure that I'm not sure.
It's a sharp pain
It's a dull pain
I haven't said it to Tom yet
Don't piss me off!
He didn't get a degree
He’s still a human being
I can't eat anything cold
What will become of us?
I'm bleeding from my anus
I don't speak English
I kek'd
Sorry babe, no kissing
How's your mum?
I'll help you book a hotel
I've lost my phone charger
I can't contact my relatives
I've lost my virginity
It's the war of the alcoholics
I'm fucking drunk
I believe it'll change my life
I wish it would've been longer
When did this get broken?
She isn't hurt
Say it once again, please
That is rude!
Insolence!
Well, well!
He's a virgin
I'm jerking off
I'm jacking off
All-in
I can't urinate
I'm pregnant and I'm bleeding
I'm in labour
I last had sex 2 days ago
I'll kill your whole family
The COVID doesn't exist
Tom is a neo-Nazi
I'll need that yet
I can't flex my neck
I've had this pain before
There's blood in my vomit
There's blood in my faeces
I'm coughing up blood
I've been shaking
I'm coughing up sputum
You're in the car
You're so vague!
Christ rose from the dead!
I'm playing a song
I want lots of food!
Want a cup of tea?
Do not forget the suitcase!
Please don't assume my gender
Rush slowly!
When does the trip begin?
Turn 360 degrees and walk away
I don't have any lessons today
Did he stay long?
Did any escape?
Did the prince come?
I know Tom's voice
He's not the one singing
I know Tom's voice
It's not him singing
I know Tom's voice
He's not the one who's singing
I'm not ready for the exam
Let's get off
Do you always get up early?
What's your nan called?
What's your nan's name?
What's your granny's name?
I can't find her
I can't find them
Do you live far off?
I'm staying at home today
Do you masturbate often?
I'd like some water to drink
There's an aerial at the top
Do you like dark chocolate?
I'm better on my own
You're such a mug
Glory to Ukraine!
Glory to the heroes!
What now then?
Tatoeba is so hard to use!
They're lying
They're lying
I didn't feel like dancing
I'm not a troll
How can I claim asylum?
Tell me, why did you do it?
Could you slice the potatoes?
I'm waiting to speak with him
I've got an interview tomorrow
Do you like fishes?
I'm about to feed the cats
Is this a goose?
Whose are the books?
I'm byelingual
That's all for now, people
I don't speak Klingon
You've got a lot of books
Who's eaten all the biscuits?
Hello, it's me
Where is the orphanage?
Why are you in your pyjamas?
Let's see what you have to say
Quit whining, silly
Don't put me on a pedestal!
Yes, it was a sunny day
That is very nice!
She didn't call me back
Tom hasn't yet called me back
We're waiting for Tom's call
Tom!
Come down, breakfast is ready
I love you, and you love me
Tom might've come here by car
There's no one left at home
If I hurt you, I'm sorry
What have I done wrong?
Or, you can find sewers
It's the bomb dot com
It's da bomb
It's top-notch
Ain't that a bitch?
This is my cat, Cookie.
Are you coming?
Yes.
Are you guys coming?
We are.
Why don't we ask her advice?
Do you know what the OSCE is?
What's in Segovia?
What does Tom eat?
What is democracy?
Have I truly become a monster?
I didn't mean to make you cry
Look what's going on
You've got everything I need
Haven't I been good to you?
What is Tom doing now?
I don't like being blindsided
What's the use in trying?
Come on, let me help
I won't walk kilometers
Why is Tom in a castle?
What's your favourite yoghurt?
Four.
That'll be hard to do
He's a bit of a scholar
I can't find Tom.
Try phoning him.
It's stopped raining
Let's go for a walk
Where did he buy this stuff?
Where did he buy these things?
Yes, please.
My flat isn't far away
Bedtime!" said Mum
Toys away and off to bed.
Neither am I!" said Mary
Which bus have I got to get?
It's not far from Paris
That's not far from Paris
He's probably forgotten
What are you doing over there?
I'm back!
I brought some takeout.
What'd you get?
Some tonkotsu ramen.
Whoa, you know me so well!
Well, let's eat already!
Nice!
I'm jealous.
Want to see them?
Yeah!
Ohh, they look so good.
There's nothing he can't do
Tell me you'll stay
Tom doesn't seem to be healthy
Now it's done with rifles
I mean, Soviet?
No, Russian.
What!?
What shall we bet?
At last you've figured it out!
His mother's hair is brown
Her mother's hair is brown
I've lost the spare key
Europe has always been racist.
Please don't stop loving me
How to stop Israel?
Tom's manners are disgusting
I won't pay anything for Tom
Is Tom feeling better now?
Why did you make Tom cry?
Tom won't fight against them
We aren't Tom's enemies
No to war!
I've never been to Hungary
I'm dead on my feet
How's that expressed verbally?
It's my partner
Did you do it all by yourself?
I've finished writing
It's now half past one
Let's have a tea break
Let's stop for a cuppa
It's a wet day
I'll do it straight away
I'll do it immediately
We're no longer together
We're not together any more
She's one of our regulars
What happened, Tom?
I've found a fledgling sparrow
What should I do?
She doesn't understand that
He doesn't understand that
Did you go to London?
I can't get you off my mind
Tetra" means four
Thank you for this message!
Thank you for your generosity!
It is the 2nd of March of 2015
It is the 3rd of March of 2015
Is life like a movie?
I'd be lost without you
How many kilos can you lift?
Where are you?
I'm still at work, darling.
Let's let them do their job
When will you tell him?
Have you ever tried a gondola?
I'm afraid of losing her
Tom doesn't want us to be here
What do you want to buy here?
It seems like I'm not well
Is Tom's cat grey?
I'm also from Berlin
It's very hard to quit smoking
I know they think I'm stupid
They're not anxious
Whom does the moon belong to?
Would you like to eat here?
When will your father come?
I really can't remember
Lock him up in the dungeon!
He's a real Siberian
Tom knows hunters' jargon
What is prison slang?
Is it a sour or sweet cherry?
It is the 8th of June of 2013
What do you think?
It is the 4th of March of 2015
It is the 4th of March of 2015
It's a coup
It is the 2nd of July of 2015
He likes drama movies, too
I said, "He has a nice body!
Call me, and I'll be there
Tom likes skiing, but I don't
Let's do this in anger!
Mary has long, beautiful hair
It's a hot day today
Who called Ann?
Can your sister drive?
At what time will he arrive?
They've elected her mayor
Have you got time tomorrow?
It's Friday at last
There's a fly on the ceiling
Are my socks dry yet?
Have you got a boyfriend?
It's quarter to eight
How was Australia?
Tom's erudition astonishes me
Tears rolled down Tom's cheeks
What are you doing?
Eating.
I've got petrol
I've got some petrol
They're always wrong, anyway
It's kind of a mixed bag
Psych!
Sike!
Fooled you!
That's so radical
I never thought we'd find Tom
What's Tom holding?
I think, therefore I'm here
I'll teach Tom how to ski
I'll keep it to myself
Just say you'll stay
Tom doesn't look scared
Tom didn't look scared
Did Tom look scared?
That's what I'm waiting for
I don't care what the cost is
I hope everything's OK?
Tom won't be all alone
Isn't that me you expected?
I'm the last one on the list
Today is "Pi Day
You're always on my mind
I think I'm going to be there
It's already August
We're already in August
Yours, affectionately
Is that girl over there yours?
Is that your girl over there?
What is this passage about?
You thought I was joking?
Did she find out at last?
First think, then speak
Why are you eating alone?
Guess my riddle!
Solve my riddle!
He is at most 20 years old
Is the station far?
Have we met earlier?
Do you want to grab a beer?
You didn't flush the toilet
Do you see the rain cloud?
Tell Tom I'll be there
Honey, I'm coming!
Do you like going to museums?
It is the 1st of June of 2013
It is the 27th of May of 2013
It is the 9th of June of 2013
It is the 8th of June of 2013
It is the 28th of June of 2013
I can't do it on my own
We're running out of petrol
Have you seen my suitcase?
Where are we meeting tomorrow?
Where shall we meet tomorrow?
Is there no cheese left?
Isn't there any cheese left?
Isn't there any more cheese?
Is there no more cheese?
When are you ringing Tom?
When will you ring Tom?
When are you phoning Tom?
When will you phone Tom?
I didn't recognise Tom's voice
Oh, I didn't know that!
Are those Tom's glasses?
Yes, they're his.
That's not her phone
This isn't her phone
Did she leave without you?
Did she go without you?
Is there an entrance fee here?
What did you ask her about?
Why is this town called that?
We haven't spoken about it
We didn't talk about it
May I see the photos again?
Did you notice the difference?
It's not over till it's over
Are you and Mary sisters?
Anything interesting on telly?
As you sow, so you shall reap
I can't find them anywhere
You'll like it here
The lift isn't working again
What did the thief look like?
Excuse me, please!
I've read his book
I'll never ever leave you
I'm on the sixth floor
We're going into town
We're driving into town
We've always lived here
When does summer begin?
The bigger, the better
Don't get mad
Another day, another dollar
There's honor among thieves
Are those Tom's glasses?
Yes, they are.
It is the 28th of June of 2013
It is the 28th of June of 2013
It is the 27th of June of 2013
When do we need to be there?
Tom can do that, too
Don't tell Tom I'm in jail
I'm not a refugee
Tom isn't a good magician
Why would you have children?
What'll become of us?
Who doesn't want to be rich?
Do you know the way home?
I'm dating somebody else now
“Long live the shadow!
I don't like you.
It's super-duper
Are you still a Covirgin?
I'll get even with Tom
Oh, that's good
I've never heard him do that
I'll probably keep listening
It's a bot
How could you say that?
It's a bot
Who won and who lost?
He's also busy
I'll buy and eat that
Tell Tom that I'll be there
I'm struggling to survive
Suddenly, it got dark outside
You know I love you, right?
Do you speak Ojibwe?
Yes, I speak a little Ojibwe
I've done all I could
When will the time come?
Come inside!
He doesn't like English
When should we leave?
Get out!
Don't come back!
Just don't go there
Don't kill the mouse!
Don't come here!
Run!
When can we go to the store?
Don't play for too long
How much for twenty tomatoes?
Why did you go?
She didn't tell us everything
I've got to be going
He's the goalkeeper
I've moved into a new flat
I think it'd be fun to do that
I've forgotten my purse
I've left my purse behind
That looks really delicious!
It's ten past three
I'll visit him soon
I'm afraid of lifts
Why is he talking so slowly?
Why does he speak so slowly?
Did he go to your school?
Was he at your school?
When are you going abroad?
Don't remind me of him!
He's almost always hungry
It's a fascinating story
Are you taking her home?
Are you taking them home?
She's asking you to wait
Aren't you together any more?
Are you no longer together?
Here is my book.
I know you aren't satisfied
Will I see you there tonight?
Tom didn't deny that
May I use this stapler?
Tom couldn't go outside
She's listened to lofi all day
I just can't wait any longer
It was rustic and believable!
Birds aren't real
Put on your high-heel shoes
Tom couldn't defend Mary
Who says it?
From where does it come?
I guess we'll never know why
Xmas is pagan, too
What was the boss's decision?
We had an argument last night?
Something's dreadfully wrong
I'm no longer alone
Tom could've hurt Mary today
Tell me you'll try to do that
Tom won't remember that
How much is a kilo of beans?
Won't you please help me?
Someday we'll meet again
Tom couldn't find his house
Did Tom anticipate his demise?
Why don't you open the door?
I'm under your spell
Do you have a blowtorch?
9/11 was an inside job
Tom couldn't stay
She's a blonde-haired girl
She's a blonde
Tom couldn't find his wallet
Tom couldn't hear anybody
Tom's room was spotless
We can't quit now
Which path did you choose?
Which option did you choose?

Tom wasn't even upset
Let's try this once again
Don't stop thinking of me
Let's get to work, comrades!
Tom couldn't be bought
It's a robot

It's epic!

Tom wasn't exercising
I've milked the cows
I've read another fifty pages
When did they get home?
Let's go back to Unit 3
Let's return to Lesson 3
Turn the telly on, please
(My nickname is Nonong.)
I've cleaned the bath
Tom's a trader
My phone charger isn't working
He's at least sixty years old
She's at least sixty years old

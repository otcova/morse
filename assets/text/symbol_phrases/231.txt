Tom can't afford to do that
Tom can't speak French well
I'll do anything I can for Tom
Tom can't tell you anything
I'll find Tom and let him know
I'm better-looking than Tom is
I know what it's about
I'm sure Tom will be impressed
I think I'll go to bed
I'm sure Tom wouldn't disagree
11 to Nov
30
You're being very unfair to me
Tom didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sure that Tom will do that
Tom didn't want to seem shy
I was very, very lucky
It's amazing that Tom survived
Tom doesn't have many books
It's been a tough year for Tom
I'll stay home instead
Tom doesn't often come here
I'm angry at everybody
Tom can't swim as fast as Mary
I'm going to leave you
I'm going to work here
Mary wouldn't let Tom kiss her
I'm not afraid of work
I've got to keep going
My hair isn't as long as Tom's
I believe it's finished
I don't have a solution
There was blood on Tom's shirt
We're waiting to hear from Tom
When does Tom's bus arrive?
I think it's intriguing
You aren't college material
I'd kill you if I could
Which floor is it on?
What floor is it on?
What did you say his name was?
What did you say her name was?
Is that your roommate?
Is it five already?
Find out about what?
I love this book!
No, not yet
I think you're bluffing
You shouldn't have invited Tom
I'd like to go sledding
I'm happy it's over now
I'm here to help people
I'm in a safe place now
I'm in a state of shock
I'm just really blessed
I'm ready for the fight
I'm really stressed out
I'm very happy about it
I've worked all my life
Tom is John's older brother
Tom is a hen-pecked husband
I did what's best for me
Tom is a straight-A student
I don't really want that
I don't think you're fat
I imagine that'll change
I just didn't believe it
Are you deaf?
I really thought I'd win
I think that's a problem
I think that's offensive
Tom is thirsty, and so am I
I'll probably be fishing
Tom isn't likely to do that
I'm fairly old-fashioned
I'm following my passion
Tom isn't much of a swimmer
I'm in really good shape
I'm not confident at all
Tom isn't much of a teacher
I'm not really religious
I'm sick and tired of it
Tom isn't such a bad person
I'm so grateful for that
I've got a lot of talent
Tom isn't very good at math
I've had lots of chances
I've heard no complaints
Tom isn't very good company
I've seen pictures of it
I've thought of it a lot
Tom isn't wearing any shoes
I can't believe it worked
I haven't heard any complaints
I hope she doesn't notice
I hope he doesn't notice
I hope Tom doesn't notice
Tom, are you okay?
I can't go without my dog
I can't really explain it
I didn't know if you knew
I don't know who did that
I don't like getting hurt
I don't regret doing that
I don't remember too much
I don't think I'd like it
I don't think I'll change
Tom can't swim as well as me
Tom didn't see what happened
Tom didn't sign the contract
I know our team won't win
We'll make sure we do that
Tom doesn't have a ticket yet
I can't complain about that
I can't emphasize it enough
I can't wait to get started
I didn't like those choices
I didn't think I'd be first
I don't feel like a pioneer
I don't have an ax to grind
I don't know if I trust you
I don't make a lot of money
I don't need any more money
Tom has three sons, I believe
I don't plan to change that
I don't see any resemblance
I don't think about it much
I had to be self-sufficient
I haven't had my coffee yet
I know I've been very lucky
I know that's not the truth
Tom didn't wear a suit today
I really didn't like that
Tom died in Autralia in 2013
I should've run away then
I think most of it's true
Tom doesn't look that strong
I think that's a big deal
I think we're progressing
I wasn't expecting to win
I wasn't sure what it was
I'll be right back, folks
I'll go whenever you like
I'll have to wait and see
I'll put $300 in the bank
I'm a little paranoid now
I'm enjoying my time here
I'm looking at my options
I'm pretty short-tempered
I'm really ready for this
I'm sure I can find a job
I've learned so much here
I don't have a job anymore
I don't want to leave here
Tom hasn't been to Australia
I don't want to wear a wig
Tom is Canadian, and so am I
I figured it couldn't hurt
I haven't slept in a while
I hear you're good at golf
I knew that wasn't correct
I know that wasn't correct
Tom isn't as tall as Mary is
I think this isn't correct
I'd be happy to discuss it
I'd like to do what you do
I'd like to fire my lawyer
I'd like to know the truth
I'd like to see the budget
I'd never say those things
I'd really rather not know
I'll do what I can for you
I'm considering my options
Tom claims that he's unbiased
I'm excited to get started
I'm not that good a writer
Tom couldn't catch the rabbit
I'm not very happy, either
I'm the world champion now
I'm very excited and happy
I've always been on my own
Tom didn't break up with Mary
I've been patient all week
I've got a wedding to plan
Tom didn't drink all the milk
I've heard that a lot, too
I've seen a lot of changes
Tom didn't take many pictures
Everyone's laughing at us
My car is not as big as Tom's
Tom's is just as new as Mary's
I should've gotten a ticket
I still couldn't believe it
I suppose it's a good thing
Tom is a teacher, and so am I
I think it's really special
I think it's very deceptive
I went to Australia in 2013
I'm going to enjoy the game
I'm hoping to make the team
I'm just going out a minute
I'm pretty happy to be here
I've always been a salesman
I've always wanted to do it
I've decided to lose weight
I've got a lot of questions
I've got nothing else to do
I've never met those people
I've never seen anybody die
I didn't know what they were
I didn't see the need for it
Tom is the one who called 911
I don't know what that meant
I don't like what's going on
I don't really feel that way
I don't see you as a teacher
I don't think that's correct
I don't want a full-time job
Tom isn't able to do that yet
I feel like I've been reborn
Tom isn't answering his calls
Tom isn't very good at French
I haven't been feeling great
I haven't been told anything
Tom isn't wearing his glasses
I hear you're good at French
I hear you're good at tennis
I hope you'll be comfortable
I know I've been very stupid
I know it'll be a great game
I never know what I'm eating
I should've asked you before
I should've done this sooner
I should've seen this coming
I still can't believe we won
Tom and Mary dated for 3 years
I think it's an awesome deal
I think it's much better now
I think that's fairly unique
I wasn't supposed to survive
I won't be able to afford it
I would've bet my life on it
I'd give you more if I could
I'm as fit as I've ever been
I'm being as honest as I can
I'm going to change all that
I'm going to miss being here
I'm not in the best of shape
I'm not sure if I'll do that
I'm taking it slow right now
I've been around for a while
I've been here my whole life
I've certainly learned a lot
I've cut down on my expenses
How is the bill paid?
She's a drag king
I've felt this way for years
I've got quite a lot of hats
I've had a great life so far
I've had a lot of fun so far
I've had good luck with this
Is French difficult to learn?
I didn't know where they were
I didn't make any adjustments
I didn't want to get grounded
Tom couldn't find a babysitter
I didn't want to let you down
I don't care how we get there
Tom couldn't get the door open
I don't recommend that at all
I don't think that's accurate
Tom didn't do anything to Mary
I don't understand that logic
I don't want my kids to smoke
Tom didn't feel safe in Boston
I don't want to hold you back
I feel I could've done better
Tom didn't give us any details
I feel like I'm just starting
Tom didn't leave his apartment
I haven't done you any favors
I hope everything's all right
Tom didn't take Mary seriously
I hope we don't do this again
She's indifferent to me
You know so many words!
Boy is this tasty!
Tom didn't want Mary to suffer
Tom didn't want anyone to know
I know what's wrong and right
Tom didn't want to participate
I should've known that sooner
Tom doesn't drink enough water
I wasn't entirely sure myself
Tom doesn't sleep much anymore
I won't interrupt you anymore
I won't live there ever again
Tom drove back to Mary's house
I'll do this as long as I can
I'm a very independent person
I'm disappointed to hear that
I'm fed up with the food here
I'm glad I never gave up hope
I'm going to get you that job
I'm just not going to do that
I'm not going to stop working
I'm not in charge of anything
I'm not really very religious
I'm turning thirty in October
I'm very sorry for what I did
There's a police officer
I've been through this before
I've been waiting long enough
I've never been a betting man
I've thought a lot about this
I've thought about this a lot
I could've played a lot better
I couldn't do anything to help
I didn't mean to offend anyone
I don't apologize for anything
I don't find it that difficult
I don't have to go any further
I don't know everything you do
I don't know how I'll get home
I don't know just what I'll do
I don't know what was going on
I don't know why we're so busy
I don't know yet what we'll do
I don't like the taste of this
I don't make the policies here
I don't mind a little pressure
I don't mind doing this at all
What is it that you wish?
What is your ideal job?
I don't see any need for a gun
I don't see how it can hurt us
I don't see that ever changing
I don't think I understand you
I don't think I'll ever retire
I don't think I'm overreacting
I don't think anything changes
I don't think everyone gave up
I don't think it was a mistake
I don't think it's a bad thing
I don't think that that's fair
I don't think we need to do it
I don't try to please everyone
I don't very often read novels
I don't walk by myself anymore
Tom isn't Mary's husband
Tom has a driver's license
I don't like sweet drinks
I don't want a gun in my house
Tom is Mary's business partner
I don't want any more problems
I don't want to live like that
I don't want to mess with that
I don't want to waste my money
I don't want you to feel alone
I don't worry about that stuff
Tom is a cold-hearted murderer
I feel it's something I can do
He didn't ask any question
She's a witch
Look who's there
I feel like I'm going to be OK
I feel like I'm ready for that
I felt I didn't need the money
Tom is a thirteen-year-old boy
I guarantee I'll get you a job
Tom is a very good-looking guy
Don't tell anyone I was here
Is there someone else?
I shouldn't have come here
I'm sorry
You still love him, don't you?
I'm no one's girlfriend
I'm sorry
Let's go eat
I'm starving
The joke's on us
Why are you so angry with me?
I'm married now
Did you have fun?
Not really, it was boring.
I'm a married woman now
I'm a married man now
I'm in way over my head
I'm an actress, not a model
Who would do this?
And why?
Why are you freaking out?
He's with me
She's with me
I haven't been home in a while
I honestly don't get it at all
I wasn't dizzy
What have we accomplished?
Have we accomplished anything?
Who is qualified to do this?
Traffic's crazy today
That's an odd question
Tell me why you're upset
I'd rather watch paint dry
I'd rather watch grass grow
I love you, Raphael!
I hope you won't leave me here
I hope you'll be able to sleep
I just didn't want to be there
I just don't really understand
I just don't want to overdo it
I just knew I couldn't do that
I just want to win, that's all
People don't smoke here
Tom is very independent-minded
Tom isn't in a good mood today
I knew you weren't really dead
Tom isn't ready to go anywhere
I know it's a hard thing to do
I know that won't happen again
I know what I did wasn't right
Tom is a hunt-and-peck typist
Just look!
I know you're happy about that
How did we get to this point?
Are you really that ignorant?
What are you trying to imply?
He didn't take the bait
She didn't take the bait
I'm writing a novel
I'm writing an article
I'm writing an essay
Oh look, a caterpillar!
At the end of the day I'm sore
I like it, but I don't love it
I like to know what's going on
I made a mistake and I'm sorry
He's not faking it
She's not faking it
Tom is a real-estate developer
Could you loan them money?
It's better for both of you
I do think it's wrong of her
I just don't love my wife
I'm certainly not the only one
She's a top-level executive
Talk less, do more
Tom wasn't born rich
How hard can this be?
It ain't over 'til it's over
Were you shopping?
Was he shopping?
Were they shopping?
Was she shopping?
Do you still believe?
In God?
Of course!
I really can't comment on that
I really didn't have any money
I really don't think it's over
He's no friend of mine
I think I don't understand you
I think it's a good compromise
I think it's a good investment
I think it's a serious problem
I think it's a wonderful thing
I think it's an excellent idea
I'm contemplating divorce
I know it's not healthy
Is it time to move on?
It doesn't ease my mind
I know I'm going to run out
I'm still concerned
It's freezing outside
Ride slower—you'll get further
That's his opinion
Are you happy with your life?
I think that's the best answer
Where's Hachi?
How are mom and dad?
What is Tom talking about now?
Do you know whose car that is?
Tom's already here
Tom isn't married to Mary
Mary isn't Tom's woman
Tom doesn't have hair
Please, wash your hands
I don't like that at all
I don't like licorice
I don't have time for nonsense
Is that clear?
Crystal clear.
He's the head honcho
She's the head honcho
I want it by today!
I'll go by plane
Oh, a butterfly!
I think we're doing a good job
I think we're going to be fine
I think we're ready to do that
I think we've done a great job
It was my first time, too
You should've come yesterday
What are you so scared of?
Is that really what you want?
All right, fine
That's it; I give up
I'm leaving
I hope you're satisfied
I thought it'd be a lot of fun
I thought you wouldn't like it
Mary isn't Tom's wife
I thought you'd ask about that
You can't just not go to work
I'm going ashore
I've been misquoted
I think it's obvious
I'm very lonely here
I'm glad I left Boston
I'll take these with me
I'm happy I left Boston
I couldn't figure it out
I'm glad you're OK again
I'm not going to skate today
What should we do now?
How can we solve this?
I'm just as busy as ever
I'm not sure I like this
I'm too drunk to do that
I've been here all night
I'm being paid to do this
I suppose we're just lucky
I think we're going to win
When may I go home?
I wasn't going to go there
I'm so happy I left Boston
I've done that three times
I don't think it'll be easy
I don't want them to starve
You're a very lucky man
You're a very lucky woman
How late is too late?
How late may I call you?
I think we'd better do that
I'd like to visit Australia
Tom doesn't wash the dishes
I'd rather ride my own bike
I'd really like to sleep in
I'll have a nap after lunch
I'll take a nap after lunch
I can't remember my password
I couldn't afford to do that
I'm following the guidelines
I'm sorry to hear about this
I'm tired of keeping secrets
I didn't tell anyone about it
I don't know how to make stew
How old is your brother?
I have no idea what'll happen
I know what you could've done
I know you're smarter than me
I never would've allowed that
Fuck off, you stupid idiot!
I wouldn't do that to anybody
I'd like to build a new house
I'll tell you what's happened
Turn that frown upside down!
I've changed my daily routine
This is a very low-stress job
I don't know anybody else here
I wasn't going to buy anything
I wasn't sure where I belonged
I wasn't the only one to do so
I won't fight with you anymore
I won't run away like a coward
I wouldn't mind doing it again
I'd do anything for those kids
I'd just like to say I'm sorry
I'd like to know what you mean
I'd like to live in that house
I'd love to have more children
I'd rather not do that anymore
I'll be glad to get it for you
I don't think that'll work
I doubt that'll work
How can I make you understand?
I'll be waiting for the answer
I'll do my best, I promise you
I'll do what the boss tells me
I'll have to go there tomorrow
I'll look at it very carefully
I'll meet you there about 2:30
I'll tell you about it someday
I'll wait like the rest of you
I'm a lot more comfortable now
I'm calling from my cell phone
I'm disgusted and disappointed
I'm entitled to my own opinion
I'm extremely unhappy about it
I'm feeling so much better now
I'm friends with a lot of them
I'm giving you one more chance
I'm glad I was able to do this
I'm going to be ready for that
I'm going to do something else
I'm going to put it in my room
I'm happy for this opportunity
I'm having a big party tonight
I'm just here to help them out
I'm just hoping we can do that
I'm no better than anyone else
I'm not ashamed of that at all
I'm not even thinking about it
I'm not going to run for mayor
I'm not going to show any fear
I'm not ready to have kids yet
I'm not too concerned about it
I'm not too worried about that
I'm now working on Park Street
I'm one of the team's captains
I'm ready to go somewhere else
I'm really proud of these kids
I'm really proud of those guys
I'm sorry if I offended anyone
I'm sure I'll get over it soon
I'm sure you have many friends
I'm surprised and disappointed
I'm told you're a good teacher
I'm too scared to say anything
I'm training for the triathlon
I'm very happy to be back home
I swear it's true
I'm very interested in the job
I'm very much in favor of this
I'm very proud of our students
I'm very surprised to see that
I've always been a hard worker
I've been a little sick lately
I've been doing it all my life
I've been gone for a long time
I've been having some bad luck
I've been here for a long time
I can't imagine Tom doing that
I've been here for a while now
I've got a lot of good friends
I've got some stuff to do here
I've got to learn to slow down
I've had a wonderful time here
I've never made a lot of money
You don't know everything I do
Father, I am guilty
Father, I wish to confess
I didn't expect more bloodshed
Mary doesn't seem very warm
I'm going by myself
This isn't surprising at all
I'm very sexy
I'm so sexy
Yes, it's a shame
This isn't at all surprising
I'll come there
I'll get there
I'm in the classroom
She's on her way to Thailand
I don't even understand myself
He's constantly abroad
Let's get back to our topic!
Am I to cry or laugh?
Bye!
What kind?
Sorry, could you repeat that?
I'm dying of thirst
Give me water!
I'm dying of hunger!
She's my favorite singer
They'll find out
They'll soon find out
Where did you buy that hat?
I'm on a top secret mission
What time do you call this?
Where on earth are we?
I'm super happy
It's so beautiful out here
I'm Tom by the way
Who would like to go first?
He didn't say anything else
She didn't say anything else
Do you like lasagna?
Do you want to make a snowman?
Do you trust me?
No.
My battery's at ten percent
Go now before it's too late
Can you do me a favor?
What kind of favor?
I've never seen her so upset
I've never seen him so upset
I don't know.
We don't
Can virtue exist without sin?
Or you don't live long
Can you say much in Dutch?
I guess I should've known
Tom speaks Hiberno-English
Can you believe she said that?
What'd you decide?
Do you like comic books?
I think it's feasible
Should we try?
We can always dream...
I'm not a psychic
I've got tons of ideas
Good ones, not so much
How long were you in Japan?
Could it have been a murder?
Jesteś próżny
I was sick, but I'm fine now
Unfortunately, I have bad news
I knew that it wasn't true
Why are you all wet?
I'll be darned
I'll get the fire started
I'm sorry
I'm listening
Tom doesn't like German food
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?
It's getting late
Is it always hot like this?
Is it always cold like this?
I don't care who started it
It's an unrestricted database
Can you quantify happiness?
I'm never going to drink again
I'd love a cold drink
Shut up and dig!
That's what I hope for
That's what I hope will happen
That's what I hope Tom will do
Yes, I think I need to go
Hopefully he'll wait for me
Don't go in the kitchen!
Tom doesn't get dizzy
We won't die
You didn't draw your dog well
Don't feel insulted
Will you come with me?
I don't want to go there alone
I don't want to go there alone
You're a man
He's a boy
Don't go in the kitchen
I think it's a very good deal
I'll bet you a silver dollar
Tom's eyes got all watery
Tom cried over Mike's shoulder
We cried in each other's arms
What do you want?
I want one of each.
I've left my charger at home
Is Tom your boyfriend?
It's complicated.
Have a lovely Christmas!
Tom is Mary's fiancé
Mary is Tom's fiancée
I hope I didn't offend you
Tom wore a long-sleeved shirt
Tom wore a button-down shirt
Who has a better idea?
Can we talk now?
That's not my mistake
Does Mary drink tea?
Are you an angel?
Are you an angel?
Yes," the angel responded
They wouldn't give me a refund
They wouldn't believe me
Tom's parents were devastated
I won't cry anymore
Stop running!
Are you going to the open day?
You're Russian?
Does anyone live here?
Does anybody live here?
Can you frame this picture?
I'm enjoying this warm weather
I don't take them seriously
What do you fancy for dinner?
Let me fasten my seat belt!
Is this project even feasible?
Let's get a bite to eat
Who can field this question?
I'll find a way to get a raise
I've found my man!
It's almost done
She is a real firecracker!
First come, first served!
First stop, the laboratory
Then we'll see
What's its fiscal status?
Are you going fishing?
It fits you like a glove!
He's quite fit!
He's fit for the position
I can't fit you in my schedule
This water isn't fit to drink
Have you fixed the dates yet?
Mary, you're flattering me
I'm truly flattered!
Why don't we flip a coin?
We're going to flip it
Let's have foie gras to start
I'd like you to meet my folks
I'm footing the bill tonight
Whose footprints are these?
Don't touch it for a minute!
First of all, I'm not for sale
I'm in town for one night only
Do you foresee any changes?
You're such a freak
I can't see a freaking thing!
Tom is totally freaking nuts!
Has the freight arrived yet?
Don't fret too much, okay?
I wasn't flirting with him
Tom's parents were shocked
I wasn't flirting with Tom
I'd like to know where you are
I've finished eating
I'm going to eat
I'm not Chinese
I'm not German
Are you awake yet?
Surprise, surprise
Did that surprise you?
I just can't stand Tom
I will die without you.
I'll go to your funeral.
It's in the yard
He's in the yard
She's in the yard
Is it Seán that's working?
It's almost Christmas
Today's not Christmas
I'll be back for Christmas
Christmas isn't far off now
Are you celebrating Christmas?
Where do you go for Christmas?
She will turn 15 tomorrow
Today I'm tired
I can't drink more beer
It's so nice to meet you
Dude, why so cocky?
I don't like arrogant people
Oh! this made him so angry
Oh, how the Tree trembled!
Not believe in Santa Claus!
This, then, is Christmas, 1862
Does your wife know all this?
Does Tom know what you did?
I'm sorry
I won't do it again
I don't understand Christmas
Aren't you happy?
Ha!
Tom's feet sank in the snow
Can you play Jingle Bells?
You'll get pneumonia
I'll make some pasta
Have you learned your lines?
How can people be so blind?
How can you be so blind?
Could I borrow your shovel?
Do you have a snow shovel?
There's snow outside
I'd caught him red-handed
I will tell you right now,
Am I that predictable?
In one word: he's a coward
In one word: she's a coward
When were you in London?
I've simplified it a bit
It's already day
They won't succeed
I'm beside myself!
Doesn't matter
Don't care
I'm just lost for words
Let's try it
The CD isn't labelled
How's that possible?
Look into the future!
Tom doesn't read
He cheats them!
Can I take a selfie with you?
As I looked, it vanished
I'd prefer a window seat
We're being pulled over
Do you go by train or car?
What is this?
What is this?
What is this?
„How did you come?“ „By foot.“
It's a snowstorm
We're going to freeze to death
Tom's snowmobile is broken
I don't have the foggiest idea
Tom's boss is very demanding
You don't love him, do you?
You don't love her, do you?
Take "good", for instance
Two and two are four.
Sometimes, Winston
It is not easy to become sane.
You don't love Tom, do you?
You do love Tom, don't you?
I saw Tom today.
Who?!
I'd love to go, but I can't
He'll freeze to death out here
I don't think Tom is a bad boy
Can I bum a fag?
I don't know what Tom is doing
I'm sure Tom regrets that now
Can you please do my hair?
I'll certainly come tomorrow
I'm convinced Tom can succeed
She can't get about much
Which one is she?
Which one is Tom?
He is not the one; I am
Is Tom the one?
I'll support Tom any way I can
How could it only come so far?
How is your new girlfriend?
Sleep!
How important?
Discover the world!
Never stop dreaming!
Who told you such nonsense?
What kind of fruit is green?
Go and don't be afraid
We'll protect you
We'll see each other on Sunday
My salary doesn't suit me
Everyone out!
Singapore is a city-state
I should've tried to help Tom
I don't think Tom will change
I don't remember what Tom did
A bird shat on my aunt's car
If that happens again, call me
Don't be mad!
Where in Helsinki do you live?
I've actually never seen it
I didn't know that Tom smoked
3 plus 5 is 8
The sum of 5 and 2 is 7
10 take away 2 is 8
5 times 20 is 100
4 times 4 is 16
45 times 2 is 90
2 times 13 is 26
It is 7 o'clock
We live on the 7th floor
I live on the 6th floor
It's the end of the year
Dude, you got to come see this
I don't care where Tom goes
They're both awful
Don't ruffle my hair
Put your thinking cap on!
Hurry up, slowcoach!
It's genius!
Get away from it all!
I'll get even with him!
I'm trying to get fit
Should we get going?
Let's get hitched!
I'm getting kind of hungry
Get off me!
Get me out of this place!
Have you gotten paid yet?
Does she hate me?
Dance in the rain!
It's a little difficult for me
Do you think Tom hates me?
I didn't know where Tom was
I've got to cut Tom's hair
Tom's eyes are green
This is everyone's victory
Tom wasn't expecting anyone
I'd hate to disappoint Tom
I'm also an amateur
I'd hate to see Tom leave
I couldn't do that to Tom
I love you anyway!
It's a square, not a cube
I don't see a single way out!
I don't speak Russian

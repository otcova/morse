So practical!
It's his weak spot
Can you fly an airplane?
This isn't a competition
Did you hear what he said?
I tried again, but to no avail
They don't give presents
I'm here to pick up my package
I'm here to pick up my book
I'm from another planet
You're disturbing my reading
What did you do to my phone?
Can I ask him something?
Can I ask them something?
Can I ask her something?
Stop trying to do Tom's job
Tom doesn't appear to agree
I'm very surprised
Tom doesn't plan to do that
I didn't enjoy that
I said I'd be there
Tom said it'll be difficult
Tom says he won't come back
Tom says that he can't help
Tom shouldn't do that today
Don't taunt him
They've finally been reunited
What shelf is the book on?
What shelf is it on?
Which shelf is it on?
Where did the accident happen?
I'm no looker
I'm not talking to her
She doesn't speak much
Tom isn't speaking
Where did you dig that up?
Why do you like Tom so much?
Didn't you say you liked Tom?
How exactly did Tom get hurt?
I'm glad you did that
I'm a little skeptical
I'm glad I'm not a dog
I'll vote for Tom, of course
I can't talk about that
I'm not sure if Tom is ready
I'm sick of listening to Tom
I'd rather not eat that
I'm waiting for Tom to start
What else can we do now?
I've admired Tom for a while
You're an ignorant fool
I've been dreaming about Tom
Is Tom still engaged to Mary?
I don't enjoy doing that
Is Tom still married to Mary?
That's what Tom and Mary did
That's what Tom is known for
I thought I'd go fishing
I wasn't at that meeting
Tom claims he didn't do that
I'd like to believe that
How long ago was this?
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
You won a free cruise!
Congratulations!
Someone spiked Tom's drink
Tom's wife filed for divorce
Stop texting me!
I'm doing very well, thank you
And you?
I'll see you in class
I've been in love before
Tom didn't ask for any money
I've had a very busy day
Tom didn't have to say a lot
Tom doesn't seem to think so
Tom doesn't want this either
I wasn't going to do that
I've never done it before
How come you don't do that?
I don't get paid very much
I live at 337 August Road
Please don't leave it there
What is that suitable for?
What were you eating?
Is everything okay at home?
Is that cat grey?
Karin" is a German name
I don't look like I'm elderly
He can't do without you
I can't not work again
Who is essential for that?
Please, don't protest
Your name?
I'm Paulo
I'm taking a dance class
Is everything OK at home?
How can I turn off this light?
I've also become fond of you
I don't want a promotion
I don't think they like me
Tom has been here since 2013
I don't want anything more
Tom isn't in high school yet
I'm trying to take it easy
Tom knows what's best for us
I've got to get this fixed
I'm really scared of spiders
I'll eat after that
I could've done much better
I don't get paid to do this
Tom says that's not the plan
I think we're a strong team
We don't have any more food
I didn't have anything to do
I don't have any food to eat
I don't think it's that easy
Tom wouldn't let that happen
Tom wouldn't provide details
Tom's children are wonderful
Tom's grandmother raised him
Tom's mother lived to be 103
Tom's situation is different
Why does ice float?
She's a total recluse
We're understaffed right now
I'm working double shifts
Who is this?
I'll wash your apple
What's Tom been up to lately?
Who's Tom going to listen to?
Are we asking too much of Tom?
Do you feel sorry for Tom yet?
Do you know Tom's middle name?
Don't let Tom know about this
Has Tom been informed of this?
How do you think Tom survived?
So, do you like it?
I agree with Tom 100% on this
I couldn't tell Tom the truth
I didn't want to let Tom down
I don't care if Tom does that
I don't care who Tom talks to
I don't expect Tom to do that
I don't know what to tell Tom
I don't know why Tom did that
I don't understand Tom at all
I feel sorry for Tom's family
I wasn't sure what to expect
Where exactly are we?
How did you enter the tunnel?
I didn't expect help from Tom
Is it a hypothesis?
I didn't expect Tom to help
I'd have a problem with that
I'd like to see what happens
I think I hurt Tom's feelings
I'd rather not comment on it
I'll make sure it gets fixed
I'll return as soon as I can
I'll see how I feel tomorrow
I'll see you in a day or two
I'm 100% sure of my decision
I'm a little bit tired today
I'm actually paid to do this
I'm afraid it's too late now
I'm glad things went our way
I'd never tell Tom to do that
I'm glad you thought of that
I'll make sure Tom isn't late
I'm going to get out of town
I'm quite sure Tom wants that
I'm going to stay right here
I'm sure Tom is proud as well
I'm not 100% sure about that
I'm sure Tom knows what to do
I'm not going to go in there
I'm sure Tom wouldn't do that
There's a bottle in the fridge
Run, Tom
Get out of here!
He's funny and charming
I won't let you harm him
I won't let you harm her
Don't worry
France, I love you!
Could you hand me that wrench?
Could you pass me that wrench?
What big ears you have!
What big eyes you have!
Details, details.
Why don't you stab me?
I'm sure Tom wouldn't like it
I'm not too happy about that
I'm not very good at singing
I'm really happy that we won
That's what Tom did last year
I'm really proud of our team
That's what Tom wants to know
I'm sick of hearing about it
That's what Tom will be doing
I'm so glad that I was wrong
That's why Tom and I are here
I'm still not happy about it
That's why Tom is still there
I'm with my family right now
This isn't just Tom's problem
I've been bitten a few times
This isn't what Tom needs now
I've got a lot more to learn
I'm not sure I feel the same
Tom and I don't feel that way
I've got a wife and children
I've got no regrets about it
I've got nothing else to eat
I've got nothing else to say
I've got to get my car fixed
Would you be able to do that?
Tom and Mary didn't deny that
Do you want to learn to drive?
Hopefully, no one will object
I'm getting undressed
It disgusts me, too
It's time for me to leave
Aren't you asleep yet?
Have you tried this cake?
It's to die for
We won't go back there again
Can't you quit it?
How does Facebook make money?
How does Google make money?
I agree with you 100 percent
Tom can't really do much else
Tom can't really help us much
Tom can't win and he knows it
I can't see what the hurry is
I can't tell you about it now
I couldn't get more than that
Tom didn't ask for an apology
I couldn't have done it alone
Tom didn't even shake my hand
I couldn't hear what you said
Tom didn't even try to get up
I didn't have anything to eat
Tom doesn't act like a leader
I didn't have anything to say
Tom doesn't know when to quit
I didn't have to say anything
Tom doesn't look like a rebel
I didn't mind doing it at all
Tom doesn't often eat at home
I didn't play very well today
Tom doesn't seem to know Mary
I didn't read the whole thing
I didn't really have a choice
I didn't say it would be easy
I didn't want to believe that
I didn't want to deal with it
I don't agree with you at all
I don't care how bad it hurts
I don't care if I live or die
I don't do this for the money
I don't expect that to happen
I don't really think about it
I don't see a problem with it
I don't see any reason for it
You're drunk!
You're bleeding!
What are polymers?
Look, a butterfly!
I love butterflies!
What is a religious cult?
It's not a genuine religion
It's a cult
It's closed for good
It's been liquidated
It's good to know
I want chocolate!
I want to swim!
I don't recycle them
Take it out!
I'm eating roasted peanuts
I don't think I would do that
I don't think I'm the problem
I don't think it's a bad idea
I don't think of it like that
I don't think that's a factor
Tom hasn't always been shy
I don't think that's the plan
Tom hasn't figured it out yet
I don't think they dislike me
I don't think we can say that
Are you busy tomorrow morning?
That's where the bottles are
Ah!
Who will save me?
Help!
That man is one cunning devil!
I'm dying," says Pierrette
I must know what you're doing
Tom is a very, very lucky man
I gotta do what I've gotta do
I guess I should've done more
Hello, Lisa!
She's a very timid girl
It's the latest fashion
A lion's teeth are sharp
She's a hopeless romantic
I'm a hopeless romantic
How does Tatoeba make money?
How does Tatoeba make money?
I think you're going to be OK
I'm not much heavier than you
I'm very glad that I did that
I've already started to do so
I've always wanted to do that
I'm going to plant a shrub
Me, I'm skeptical
I'm an unrepentant shopper
I'm an incorrigible shopper
Can I?
May I have one of these?
May I have some water?
May I quote you?
May I borrow your pencil?
We haven't discussed that yet
Which bus goes to the airport?
I don't feel guilty about that
I don't know much about Boston
Tom said he'd almost given up
I don't really want to do that
Tom said he's doing just fine
Tom said that wasn't the case
Tom said that's fine with him
I really don't mind doing this
Tom says he isn't ready to go
I think I'd better do that now
Tom says he wasn't being paid
Tom says he's not ready to go
I'd rather not comment on that
Tom says it's hard to explain
I've been in Boston since 2013
Tom says you're a good artist
Why do mosquito bites itch?
My room's a mess
What's this fruit called?
I'm not scared of terrorists
She's not a virgin anymore
I'll be back soon
Who am I?
What do I do?
How do I live?
How often do you eat pork?
Do you eat meat every day?
You're a good-for-nothing
They're fighting for liberty
Look!
The train is there!
He's cooking
You messed up!
Tom was a plain, ordinary kid
Pick a book for yourself!
Can I go back to sleep now?
Did it help?
A little.
Let's go to my place
I'm sorry
What have you gotten me into?
What have you gotten us into?
Why do turtles have shells?
The tide has turned!
Good luck!
I'm your boss
Don't join the book burners
Tom wasn't entirely surprised
Tom wasn't hurt in the attack
Tom won't be around next year
Tom's father was a mean drunk
Tom's first wife died in 2013
Tom's going to be quite happy
There are new-born fanaticisms
Hi everyone, I'm Tom
Hi everyone, I'm Mary
I'm beyond happy
I'm beyond happy!
He missed the 8:30 train
I aced the test!
Tom is obsessed with Pokémon
I don't like okra
I don't like being single
Can you stay for dinner?
Tom rushed to Mary's aid
Why are you acting so jumpy?
Is that real blood?
I don't mind the attention
Tom's luck eventually changed
Tom's new wife's name is Mary
Tom's prediction was accurate
Tom's situation was different
We can't allow Tom to do that
What else does Tom need to do?
What's Tom been doing all day?
Why did the police arrest Tom?
Why is Tom still on this team?
Why did you sneak up on me?
You want me to go?
How many do you have in stock?
Do you have any left in stock?

How much are these potatoes?
Do you have any smaller ones?
This is so bad, it's good
It's so bad, it's funny
It's so bad, it's hilarious
He's just a pretty face
You slave driver!
It's so bad, it's good

I'd like three tickets, please
I'd like one ticket, please
I'd like four tickets, please
I'd like five tickets, please
I'm going to go see a movie
Want to come?
There's no way that's true
I'm an extremely humble person
These are all lies!
Would I tell a lie?
Would I lie to you?
No, I guess not
How much is this computer?
How much is this laptop?
He's one of her many lovers
But that's incredible!
It's all the rage these days
I'm not hungry anymore.
You're clever
I'm terrible at chess
I'm not big on sports
I'm not hungry now
That cat doesn't like that dog
You aren't very smart
Japan's climate is calm
Don't drink
Who is going to the store?
Tom didn't agree with Marie
He didn't know to do
Fly!
Tom, how are things?
This is me?
You don't have an umbrella?
I assume you've heard from Tom
I didn't know how fast Tom was
I don't agree with Tom on much
I don't think Tom did anything
It's nearly six
Tom shouldn't spend so much
We can't waste even a minute
I'll go to your house tomorrow
What on earth got into you?
There's no time for talking
Time has come to act!
What if she's gone for good?
I don't think Tom is in Boston
I guess I should've helped Tom
I had no idea Tom wasn't happy
I hope Tom doesn't do it again
I hope you don't tell Tom that
I could've done it better
I hope we're not intruding
I'll be busy all day tomorrow
I'm sorry, we're all out
When will it arrive?
They're finally here
He's got tons of neat gadgets
Do you like the show?
Hang up the phone now!
Oh my mother tongue!
Did you like the show?
I know Tom would've liked that
I'm sure Tom's mother is proud
I'm waiting for Tom to do that
I've known Tom for three years
Tom doesn't want to go with us
How the hell did that happen?
Tom isn't as qualified as Mary
Tom said he heard Mary's voice
Tom said he'd like to see more
Tom said he's going to do that
Tom wasn't in a good mood then
We're going to the beach
Are you coming?
We're going to the beach
Would you like to go with us?
Tom will be at tonight's party
Tom's family congratulated him
Tom's home burned down in 2013
Do you hate horror movies?
Next!
Could I speak to Tom?
I've only met Tom twice
I'm rather shy
I'm very strict
How is your brother?
I'll get Tom to call you
It's very hot inside
Just a minute, please
Can I open the windows?
Tom, do you know where we are?
I'll never tell anybody
Are you calling me a thief?
Where is the student?
Don't forget to invite Tom
Let's build a wall
I love you, Dad
Who's up for some ice cream?
Which of you was here first?
How hard would that be?
Tom probably isn't hungry
Can I speak to Tom, please?
I think that's a shame
Did you ask them to wait?
I'll ask Tom to cook today
How is everybody at home?
That's just not possible
I think that's what Tom did
That's probably not good
Be loved!
Come here!
Hello, Tom!
Release him!
Let go of him!
Choose us!
Why are they mad?
We're about through here
Where do you buy clothes?
Would you please hold on?
You're a terrific writer
Can I go home early today?
I think I'll stay at home
I think you're both crazy
I think you're both wrong
Actually, I do not really know
Do you know Tom's surname?
Let's greet our visitors
Where will we find the truth?
If he is tired, let him sleep
Where will we start?
Come one Tuesday, if possible
No, it is not me!
It is you!
I didn't know you still cared
It's definitely a problem
The system isn't flawless
We're really running late
I really shouldn't be here
Obviously that wasn't true
I don't make films
Where do cedars grow?
Harald?
What's your manager's name?
Can any of you speak French?
Do you have an extra ticket?
Harald?
What an unusual name!
I could not believe my eyes!
You're both wrong
What?!
Impossible!
I should've come here first
I should've done it already
I should've never done that
It's not our responsibility
That's always a possibility
She's at work
We're trying to get donations
It's a habit that might stick
He's such a wimp
I'm not touching you
You're stupid.
I know you are, but what am I?
Please don't tell Dad
Please don't tell Mom
Please don't tell
What type of person are you?
I don't come here very often
I think that's a better idea
I'm sorry
Where did you buy that shirt?
Cobbler, stick to your last
I didn't need to sell my car
Each day has 86,400 seconds
I've only used this two times
Do you have any extra tickets?
I don't like waiting in lines
I don't like watching sitcoms
Do you know where he is?
I mean, Argentina
Do any of these interest you?
I'm a grammar Nazi
Don't be such a grammar Nazi
Run away!
Let's run away together
Let's elope
I'm glad our paths crossed
I still can't believe my luck
I still can't figure that out
I suppose that's all I can do
I don't do kindness
Do you have a big house?
He doesn't walk
When will you need it?
I think it's a fantastic idea
I think it's a realistic fear
I think it's a wonderful idea
I'm behind schedule
They're behind schedule
The elevator isn't working
My phone's stopped working
My laptop's stopped working
Have you tried turning it on?
Have you tried rebooting it?
Have you tried restarting it?
Who doesn't know some Spanish?
Please don't come in
Don't let the dog come in
I'm going into the store
An excellent idea!
Here you go, the bill
I think it's too early to tell
I think that's a bad solution
I think that's a huge mistake
I'm looking for my shoes
Have you seen them?
Did Jane pray last night?
Muriel turned 20
I don't learn
I don't study
Suddenly, it started to rain
It's a shame Tom didn't know
We're friends since Monday
I've always had a sweet tooth
I don't like energy drinks
When does your vacation start?
I believe that it's all a hoax
I don't know why they did that
You mean Norman Conquest.
Yeah, whatever.
Don't worry about me
I'll find a way to get by
That's a bunch of malarkey
That's a bunch of hogwash
What a bunch of hogwash!
What a bunch of malarkey!
That's horrific!
It's the best
It's going to be the best
Boston for the Bostonians!
Like my new pants?
Like my new beach shorts?
Like my new shirt?
Do you like my new shirt?
Here's your beer
You shouldn't have bought that
Where's the love?
Is it free of charge?
I'm so glad I listened to you
That's not original
Second set, Krajicek to serve
This is incredible!
I'm glad I listened to you
That's not a real problem
That's a first world problem

It's actually very simple
Don't put sugar in the coffee
I can't be manipulated
Which windows are broken?
You shouldn't have!
Have you ever petted a snake?
Monica didn't study very much
It's optional
It's not optional
It's either him or me
But I do love you.
Then why won't you do it?
I've started dating again
I don't have a horse
That's going to be a challenge
Party time!
He's that awful
I love walls, and I love China
They're all tremendous
I don't understand any French
There's no need to hail a taxi
That task wasn't easy
Who'd like ice cream?
Mary's not envious
All the best everyone!
All the best to everyone!
Our store isn't open
I wish you a nice weekend!
Wish you a nice weekend!
Tom doesn't want to talk to me
But that's not likely at all
Let go of my hand!
The fish doesn't taste good
Can I help with something?
Who will they choose?
Who will they elect?
What shall we have for dinner?
Which fruit is yellow?
Which dog is black?
They're losers
They've changed a lot
Don't make me angry
Did you see him often?
I'm not Italian
What colour is this cat?
Which flower is blue?
Did he kiss you?
Did he kiss you?
Yes.
I knew it!
You're obviously dying to know
Where did he kiss you?
Where did he kiss you?
On my lips.
Tom's cheeks turned red
What colour is this flower?
Is light a wave or a particle?
This is Russia!
This is "free of charge
We are the country of clowns?
That's pure nonsense
That's a hen
What does Boyle's law state?
Who is more intelligent?

My son!
Is that magpie pie?
Is milk healthy?
Is black tea healthy?
Tom's lecture was a snooze
I'll get you something nice
I'd buy it if I weren't broke
If I weren't broke, I'd buy it
Who doesn't love walls?
Has anyone seen that movie?
Has anybody seen that movie?
Have you read that book?
Have you seen that movie?
Has anyone read that book?
That's indeed curious
I'm all alone.
But that's not true
You have friends!
I'm all alone.
But that's not true at all!
You have friends!
Tell us a story!
Tom's awkward around women
Hold it like this.
Like that?
No, like this.
Mary took a self-defence class
Is that a scientific fact?
I don't care if you believe me
Tom's in heaven now
Space has no "up" or "down.
“Tropos” means change
Tom doesn't wear pajamas
That’s almost 32 Earths
Venus doesn’t have any moons
Why are planets round?
Why are planets round?
It's not like that
We're just friends
Just ask next time, okay?
You're safe and sound
That's the important thing
I'm fine.
No, you're not.
Deathbed?
He's never been better!
Yes.
A miracle has happened!
Children, let us go pray!
A miracle has happened!
I heard that Tom was dying.
Dying?
He's alive and well!
I heard that Tom was dying.
Dying?
He's alive and kicking!
I heard that Tom was dying.
Dying?
He's hale and hearty!
You never cared about me!
We should meet.
You pick the place.
That's enough, thanks!
That's the average
That's the wrong answer
This isn't dangerous
How I wish you were here!
I'm going to the square
What a big book!
How many times did they kiss?
Just once.
Why is it blue and white?
The current year is 2011
What color is this cat?
Did you say something to him?
Sometimes, people lie
Do you like to run?
Hello," I said
That is disgusting!
That is gross!
Is that dangerous?
Hannibal before the gates!
I still haven't found work
No, he's our business manager
They're not losers
They're my friends.
Do you copy?
I still haven't found a job
Just eat half!
It's a very old book
It's a really old book
Is that a public domain book?
Is it in the public domain?
Has the copyright expired yet?
This is an injustice!
This year is 2011
I don't use shower gel
Do you have any?
It's very big these days
It's very popular these days
Do you have enough space?
(I've) been very busy recently
It is just a prank!
Is this free?
Nothing is free!
You didn't feel dizzy
Listen..

Do you visit this place often?

I know what I know!
Don't fear the future!
I can't accompany you
I don't want to wait for you
I won't wait for you
And what if someone sees you?
At home, we speak Hungarian
Open the window!
That's my box
That's not my box
You're too soft on him
We had a deal!
Tom wears horn-rimmed glasses
Stay as long as you'd like
What is this?
Don't touch that.
Kim's smile is really nice
I walk to school in 30 minutes
Does she know?
I run 10 kilometers every day
I don't wanna go in the pool
Me, hate you?
Don't be ridiculous!
We're friends now
Me, hate you?
Don't be ridiculous!
We're best friends now
This doesn't bode well at all
You don't contribute enough
I won't come late again
I'm worthless
That's only collateral damage
It's only collateral damage
Now I'm free
He doesn't like soccer
Don't slurp
Don't slurp your soup
That's just one example
I'm at a friend's house

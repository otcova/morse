I'm really from Firipin.
No, Firipin!
Ziri wasn't on a service road
Ziri called out Rima's name
Again, there was no response
Ziri still didn't show up
Ziri still didn't speak
Ziri grabbed his 12-gauge
Ziri didn't get any sleep
Don't worry about it
That was an oryx.
Ziri didn't hurt himself
Ziri hasn't come back yet
Ziri's dog is growling
Ziri's family was upset
Ziri narrated Rima's story
Now, let's begin
Ziri's tent is still set up
Ziri's tent was gone
Ziri messed with Rima's stuff
Ziri sat there, paralyzed
Ziri hasn't moved
This was nothing like a dog.
It was probably a hyena.
Why do you speak to the wind?
You're wasting time!
Why do you waste your time?
You're talking to the wind!
What was your hometown like?
This isn't salty
Welp, I'm screwed
I'm not strong at all
You don't look a day over 30
They don't want to see you
It’s good for everyone.”
He's an ambulance driver
He's an ambulanceman
There's only one peg left
Whose jumper is this?
Whose jumper is that?
I'm going to the chemist's
I met Tom's parents
Are you dieting?
Could you sit there?
Lend me a pen, will you?
It's a quiet day today
This bottle of wine costs €3
I'm peeling potatoes
There's no lift in my building
What did she write to you?
Pleased to meet you, Tom.
The pleasure is all mine.
Tell me if Tom's in
Tell me if Tom's at home
I didn't see who took the book
What should I call the kitten?
I didn't catch that
Could you spell it, please?
Tom's French is useless
I didn't catch that
Could you spell it, please?
Don't tease me!
Tom, you wimp!
Ziri is currently twenty-four
Ziri's drive was long
Ziri didn't wear a uniform
Ziri's GPS went out
Ziri entered Rima's car
Ziri sat by the fire, smoking
Where are the snacks?
Where is breakfast?
Ziri's shoulder was bleeding
Ziri's neck was bruised
Ziri didn't see anyone around
Who was talking to Ziri?
That's when Ziri screamed
Ziri doesn't use a tent
Ziri shouldn't have done that
It was April 4th, 2004
On Thursday, things changed
Rima isn't wearing a nightgown
Tom didn't help me with it
What should she do?
It'll be hard to find Tom
It won't be easy to find Tom
What are you, Tom, 40?
How dare you!
I'm 37.
Tom isn't good at bowling
I don't know how to answer
It'll be mine
I can hear you, you know
Where can I put this box?
Am I already dead?
She's a typical feminist
Let's enjoy this afternoon tea
Let's all go to the ballpark
I'd really like to talk to you
What a crazy request!
It's foggy
Why are you two still up?
Ziri didn't approve
Ziri doesn't remember his name
Ziri got baptized in 2004
The breeze cooled Ziri's feet
Ziri's eyes were pupilless
Ziri's eyes were bloodshot
How could Ziri have done this?
Ziri looked at Rima's history
Ziri wasn't in Rima's cult
Ziri yelled into Rima's ear
The dog's house was on fire
Ziri's dog was home
Ziri's dog was in his bed
The noise came from Ziri's dog
Jackals don't live around here
Ziri's body felt cold
Who's in the room with us?
Ziri grabbed Rima's arm
Ziri saw the creature, too
Shoo!
Just go away!
Ziri's body relaxed
Something grabbed Ziri's ankle
Ziri wasn't casting a shadow.
He was probably a vampire.
Ziri wasn't sure why
Come here.
Why?
Ziri died on Rima's property
Ziri doesn't know who Rima is
Ziri's dad was snoring
At the time, Ziri was smoking
That's when Ziri saw Rima
Ziri's mother never drank
I'm going to the dentist's
What was it that Tom gave you?
But that doesn't affect me
Ziri stopped by Rima's house
Was that a leprechaun?
A leprechaun isn't funny
Ziri can't outrun Rima
Ziri's sister wasn't blond
Call a cab, and let's go home
My hour is not yet come.
You'll sleep late
This is a warning!
Should I peel the potatoes?
Does this bag belong to you?
Do you know whose tie this is?
Do you know who owns this tie?
Where are you lot off to?
He's obviously lying
I'm glad you want to come
I'm glad that you want to come
I've never really liked her
Is that gear new?
Are those clothes new?
I'll copy this quickly
I'll quickly copy this
That'll be twenty euros, then
Open the door!
I want to get out of here!
Yes, for the most part
Fire away!
Let's catch a taxi and go home
Let's flag a taxi and go home
Let's get a taxi and go home
I won't waste it
Don't trust yourself too much
Hey, what is that here?
He's not my husband
That thing's ginormous!
That guy's following us
Do you have your receipt?
I'm a little moved
Which city do you live in?
Looks like she's still there
I'm going to set you on fire
There's a shortcut here
I don't believe in psychics
I'm waiting for payday
Your luck's just run out
That'll happen very soon
It'll happen very soon
That won't happen anytime soon
They aren't recognisable
Geniuses make mistakes, too
This isn't easy for me
Your client's body is delicate
Is this gear new?
Are these clothes new?
They're unrecognisable
Which drawer is it in?
I don't swim at night
Come on, you lot
This isn't funny any more
I can't
I'm busy.
What about tomorrow night?
I'm busy then as well.
Did that make Tom angry?
Have you both had lunch?
How are you?
I haven't seen you for ages!
I'd known that for a long time
Silence won't help us now
I'm actually not brave
Don't hold back
Why not the two of them?
Tom's got issues
That file is off-limits
It's a bit much
Mary!
I can't eat anymore
Is Tom in his office yet?
Where did you see these at?
Why did Ziri agree to do that?
Ziri's mind was still in shock
Ziri used Rima's phone
Ziri didn't have a cellphone
Ziri was at Rima's house
Ziri can't be far
Ziri's dog kept whimpering
Ziri's dog began to bark again
Ziri's radio cut out
Ziri's eyes were blue
Ziri's fire was blazing
Ziri didn't hear any response
Ziri's kids were a bit noisy
Is everyone accounted for?
Ziri was in his tent, asleep
What's in the water?
What is in the water?
Rima's body changed
It didn't feel like that
Ew!
What's this stench?
I hope it's not a skunk
Ziri's dad and mom split up
I kinda forgot.
So is it yes or no?
That's sheer nonsense
This is a girl's hat
I'm sure that Tom did it
Wake up!
Collect the spirit flames!
You are ready!
Let us play!
Is India playing cricket ?
What time do the banks open?
Sagun doesn't like cricket
He's in his hotel room
We're closing in an hour
What did they feel?
Tom has stolen Mary's necklace
Why doesn't he ever smile?
Do you dare to confront Tom?
Which books have you read?
You'll just get in my way
Wow, Tom!
You made this?
Do bears dream?
Who's older?
I like Tom's opinion
It's a very rare edition
I don't go to the gym
I'm just as curious as you
I'm just as curious as you are
Can I play now?
I'll study when I'm done
Let's buy him a watch
Why is it that you love Tom?
It's not too short, is it?
I heard you were from Canadia.
It's Canada.
How spooky!
What the hell is a trapezoid?
I'm dying of thirst!
Yes, so am I
It's rather dark here
Tom's last name is Tom
One for you, one for me
One for you, one for me…
Mom, what's happening here?
You have me!
I love her!
What's Tom's name?
What do you think it is?
And that's not the worst part
Don't worry
I'll buy you the bread
It's on my way anyways
Tom's family name is Jackson
Can't it be me?
It's because I'm not charming
Ziri's heart was pounding
Ziri's blood was running cold
How can I make him like me?
Tom hasn't eaten his chips
Tom didn't eat his chips
Salieri didn't poison Mozart
That's brilliant, that is
Tell us so we know, too
The time was exactly 1.23
Maybe it's all in my head
I'm bored
What shall I do?
I'd started to forget Tom
Ziri wasn't all that tired
Ziri's sheep were panicking
The hyena's fur was dark
Ziri's body was torn up
What a let down!
Ziri couldn't catch his breath
Ziri wasn't so worried
Ziri's eyes became heavy
Ziri got that feeling, too
Ziri's dog stopped growling
Ziri needed to break, too
Ziri's dog started whimpering
The zombie's ribs were showing
What Ziri saw wasn't a person
Ziri ran and didn't look back
Ziri was screaming: "Yeti!
This didn't reoccur
Ziri's dog wouldn't shut up
Ziri's house has been torched
It's first come, first serve
I'll go for help
I'll go get help
Don't try Tom's patience
You've been gone too long
This party's going to suck
Want to tag along?
I've got midterms
I've got finals
I've been having a blast
Stealing is bad!
Is today a bad day?
They can't see well
I'm a bad mother
I'm a bad father
That's not true
Who said that?
Why do you buy three of these?
What did you buy this for?
The hyena hasn't moved
Ziri doesn't want to be seen
Ziri was out, looking for Rima
What the heck was that?
It must be a hyena.
The sun doesn't touch here
Are hyenas predators?
Snow in August?
That's impossible!
It's snowing in summer
Ziri doesn't want any trouble
Ziri's breathing began to slow
Praying won't help
Ziri was here, scared
The radio didn't work
What a crappy warning!
I'm leftist
Suddenly, Ziri heard a meow
Ziri's gun was gone
The cat was on Ziri's lap
Ziri hasn't slept very well
The bear was large, very large
Are yetis real?
Ziri headed Rima's way
It didn't sound like a hyena
Isn't it hot?
I did that, but Tom didn't
You can't do the impossible
Where are you?
It wasn't real for Tom
I'm beginning to feel better
You're not hot?
Can I get you anything else?
The bill, please.
I'm now going dancing.
Oh, I'll come.
Don't buy Tom anything sweet
Shall we wait till tomorrow?
Should we wait until tomorrow?
All right, but only till noon.
Is that you in the photo?
Wake him up, then!
No one can stop you.
There you are, then.
Don't tell me you're jealous!
Yes, I am!
All right?
Don't you want to go to bed?
Can I see my daughter?
Do you know what I think?
No, what?
Know what I think?
No, what?
It's on Friday
Do you want to go?
I'll go if you go.
Mary, love!
Wake up!
I've got to go out now
Tom, say please…" "Please!
Clear off!
Did you hear me singing?
Could you open the door?
It's freezing out here
Ziri wasn't scared to admit it
Ziri had Walid's voice
Ziri can't lie to Rima anymore
We've got loads of time
They'll probably be back soon
Who threw that rock?
Ziri grabbed Rima's shoulder
Ziri's camp is just there
Ziri left from Bejaia, Algeria
Ziri can't really explain that
The hyena circled Ziri's tent
Ziri's hair stood straight
Ziri put out Rima's fire
Ziri is a first-time camper
The gazelle didn't stop
Ziri is Rima's fellow ranger
Ziri doesn't have rabies
What killed the gazelle?
Ziri reported a break-in
It's just kids being kids
What about the people?
Who cares about the people?
Ziri stared into Rima's face
Ziri wasn't a threat
This is my grandparents' house
How did Tom recognise you?
What is between you and Tom?
He's in the know
It's well-prepared, isn't it?
How do we open this?
I won't be alone for long
It's a big step backward
I'm really worried about it
I'm really worried about this
Who would vote for Tom?
Ziri's mouth was watering
Ziri didn't come to the center
Ziri threw rocks at Rima's van
Ziri won't know the truth
Ziri doesn't were here anymore
Ziri didn't want to pay
Ziri's engine was still on
Ziri's camera was going bad
Ziri didn't make a move
Ziri can't shoot
Ziri isn't there alone
Ziri was in full-on sprint
What were those animals?
That's incredibly cliche
Ziri stroked Rima's cheek
Ziri's mom hugged him tightly
So, why?
Why, then?
Do I turn there?
What is the cause?
So, why did you say?
So, I will not say nothing
Won't they say something?
Who is ahead?
Maybe it's just my imagination
Maybe it's just my imagination
Why do you swear so much?
Tom's power is fading
You deserve happiness, too
We visited our mother's grave
I want to win!
Why can't I be you?
Ziri didn't know how to walk
Ziri's house has a fence
Ziri doesn't like dogs inside
Ziri got quiet, listening
Ziri called out his dog's name
Ziri's dog was prancing around
Ziri didn't move at all
Suddenly, the room lit up
I've got a leaky tap
Ziri's car was ready to go
Ziri doesn't backpack
This is a huge no-no
Ziri's camp was already set up
How did Ziri set his camp up?
She's getting into the lift
She's going into the lift
I'll ask you just one question
I've warned him several times
I'll try to talk him round
I'll try to persuade him
He's behind with his payments
He's in arrears
Must I do everything myself?
I've posted the letter for you
It's only mid-afternoon
They're not my words
That's prime time for hunting
It could be Ziri's dad
What caused that feeling?
What's that behind the tree?
Ziri didn't see any gazelle
Ziri heard a howl, too
Was it a hyena?
Who can say for sure?
It probably wasn't Ziri
Ziri couldn't really sleep
Ziri's life returned to normal
Ziri's mom passed away
Ziri quit his job in 2004
Tell me yes!
Tell me just, yes!
Yes, like that
Did you propose to her?
Have you proposed to her?
Just say I want you!
Just say I want her!
Say I love you!
Say I love them!
Head northeast!
Who is the child in front?
Where is the east?
Don't drink too much beer
He didn't even call
I don't know what we're doing
Tom's writing is very legible
I know that you aren't asleep
Give them water!
Give him water!
Give her water!
Give him money!
Give them money!
Give me money!
Leave them alone!
Laisse-nous tranquille !
Donne-moi l'argent de poche !
See you the year after!
Go back ahead!
It's my house
Tom didn't invite me in
Wanna make a bet?
We close at five o'clock
Can you scoot over?
Could you scoot over?
Tom's ears stick out
I'm a baseball fan
It's a fire hazard
Tom's tie was undone
Let's call in sick
That's a nice-looking tie
That's a great tie
Who stole my money?
Tom's hearing isn't very good
I'm a born sceptic
I don't like dining alone
I think she's thirsty
I'm going to America next year
Are you Bolivian?
Do you have binoculars?
This is based on true events?
It's been about two hours
That's no joking matter
That's nothing to joke about
Everything's falling apart
Let's go west
Why are those people here?
They came for Tom.
And you're supposed to be Tom
I can't stand my neighbors
I'm in a terrible hurry
Can I leave it here?
She's not one to lie
I finally got a job!
Why aren't the kids at home?
We're making dessert
Who just called?
I don't drink soda
These days, he is so busy
Tom isn't watching TV
Is Rima and the baby alright?
Ziri's skin appeared smooth
Ziri was Rima's hiking partner
Does this valley have a name?
There was a fire very close-by
The fire consumed Ziri's truck
Ziri stood there, listening
Ziri couldn't locate Rima
Oh scrap!
Oh boy!
In fact, I can't wait to–huh?
What happened?
What's up, Link?
Morshu, what is going on?
Hah, simple
Wow, so you threw us a party?
Hah, nope
What the hell?
That is illegal, you know.
You... you did what?
I know what he said!
Have you got any cash?
Where's my mum?
How about a cuppa?
My father's not at home
My dad's not in
We've run out of petrol
I'm translating for Tom
You've got better
Don't do that any more
We've run out of fuel
He doesn't drink any more
She doesn't drink any more
I can't remember any more
I don't remember any more
We're not in at the moment
Is this the railway station?
Where do I pay for the petrol?
They've proved themselves
They've proved their worth
Who told you about the fire?
Is this your home?
Yes, that is it.
Well, I live here
Will you pick me up at seven?
I can't be there before 8.30
Have you seen my green book?
When are we meeting?
Have you got travel insurance?
We're going on holiday
We're going clubbing
What's for tea?
He's a good father
Shall we meet for dinner?
Shall we meet for lunch?
He's a good actor
Ziri was circling Rima's tent
I'm not allowed to say
I'm not permitted to say
Those aren't my words
Don't touch another tree
Who was the screenwriter?
What's in this bag?
Why's it so heavy?
He's eating nuts
Where do your kids live?
What is Tom doing with that?
This is a children's song
These are Ɛmar Mezdad's books
By asking, you get to the city
How's dinner coming along?
Is that her husband?
Did anyone see him fall?
Did anyone see it fall?
I just can't break this habit
Do you think you can win?
The buck's antlers were sharp
Ziri was still half-asleep
Ziri doesn't know much
Ziri doesn't want to interfere
Who do Muslims pray to?
Who's the god Muslims pray to?
Ziri didn't bury the dog
Ziri didn't touch the blanket
Ziri doesn't know what he saw
Finally, the rain stopped
I'd like us to start
I won't help him any longer
What use is Tom?
Are you all satisfied?
Are you guys satisfied?
Tom isn't Mr. Right
Who has called?
What is the current date?
Start the countdown!
I haven't gone there in ages
Do you think I can handle it?
He's the father of my child
He's my baby daddy
It's only been two years
Who took my chair?
Subscribe to the channel!
I'm a strong person
Don't rush
Kind isn't the same as nice
Does he sell mineral water?
You've become better
Yeah, dream on!
I did!
The wound's got to be stitched
She's a gynaecologist
I'll make amends
I insist!
I insist on it!
So, who is your dad?
Tom is a first-rate scientist
Have you got any cash on you?
Do you have any cash with you?
I've known him since childhood
The people there weren't nice
That's artistic licence
It's artistic licence
What's your favourite sport?
I'd buy it If I wasn't skint
I'd buy it If I weren't skint
He missed the 8.30 train
I'm sure he'll pass the exam
I'm sure he'll pass his exam
Where's the nearest tube?
My bicycle's rear tyre is flat
My bike's back tyre is flat
I'm not into girls, Rima.
Ziri is my boyfriend.
It's Ziri's favorite trail
Ziri's face was motionless
Ziri's sight never left Rima
Ziri's dog began growling
Ziri didn't make much sound
What made Ziri trip?
Ziri said he couldn't see it
Ziri couldn't hear that
Ziri was wearing flip-flops
Is Ziri following me?
Ziri didn't smell that smell
Please, I didn't do anything!
You mustn't be afraid of Tom
You can't lie to yourself
We're heading back
It's sold out, thank you
How big is your bed?
I'll close the door, okay?
I'll stick to my principles
Do you agree with their ideas?
Who's paying for the wedding?
Who's footing the bill?
I'm bored
Let's do something else
I'm going to see them tomorrow
Because it's the truth.
This is all completely ad-free
Ziri's mother came to get him
It was a woman's voice
Ziri's skin was pale white
Ziri's hand stopped moving
Ziri's adrenaline was pumping
Lucky for Ziri, he survived
Ziri clearly wasn't breathing
Ziri's heart exploded
Ziri's radio blew up
Ziri doesn't respect authority
Ziri's muscles ached
I don't wanna go to school
Could you budge up?
Ziri acted in Rima's film
I won't tell Tom where you are
Which hospital is he in?
The sales pitch didn't go well
It's been a month
This isn't your first warning
Why did I fall on you?
I mean, why did I fall at all?
You hear me?
Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Don't touch that switch!
I'm not dying for them
What the shit was that?
I'm literally broke
Yikes, you got defensive.
What's this junk?
He won't starve the dogs
By "here" I meant Australia
Let's smoke a bowl first
Coyotes aren't nasty
Don't try to befriend a bear
It's 4:20
At my age, studying is tiring
Can she cook?
Who cares?
No, it wasn't.
The dog saved Ziri's life
Ziri's pants popped open
Ziri was alive, just barely
What's this piece for?
The Guardian.
Ziri has traveled 400 miles
Ziri's dog began to growl
In a way, Ziri was right
Ziri's dog barked so loud
Ziri's dog barked so fiercely
Satan's power is weak here
How did Ziri survive?
Come see, come see!
Ziri believed it, too
Ziri isn't coming back
That wasn't a happy smile
Ziri's face was split into two
Ziri can't run very fast
Ziri's chest got all tight
Is something else at play?
Ziri was screaming Rima's name
Ziri's food was being set up
Ziri's dog was digging
Ziri can't find the trail
Ziri's shirt was brand-new
Ziri's dog is trained well
Ziri's dog followed the scent
Ziri's dog followed him
Ziri's dog started to dig
Tom is going to live with us.
Over my dead body!
You can't stay here any longer
It's dangerous for us
Do you like cranberry juice?
It's not regulated by law
I've never filed a lawsuit
She looked at him, smiling
I don't like turnips
How do you feel about turnips?
Some questioned Ziri's ethics
How will Ziri climb back out?
The things eyes..
Well..
Ziri's hands were shaking
Ziri's body went missing.
It was taken by the Yautja.
He's five years older than me
You accuse me of impropriety?
What a charming voice!
Unforgettable!
You're a man, so don't cry
Is it based on true events?
You're really taking your time
Pick up the pace!
Professor, I have a question
It could've killed Tom
I attended my friend's funeral
Tom can't take a hint
Tom's voice is strident
The word is 'dissonant.'
You've got no stamina
You've got no staying power
Do you fancy one as well?
Could you make me one?
I'll give you a kiss!
I don't agree with your ideas
It'll snow this weekend
This weekend, it'll snow
He's Turkish
There's so much BS about AI
The hyena wasn't scare
Ziri couldn't just sit there
That's how they live
That's how hyenas hunt
Welcome back to Shrek's swamp
It's not my native language
Ziri didn't find anything else
Ziri likes to rock-hunt
Would kids find this scary?
For context, I live in Algeria
Ziri's whole body was tense
May I give you a kiss?
Who was Ziri's supervisor?
Ziri wasn't completely alone
Is this a literal translation?
Where did she find it?
Where did she find you?
What do the people want?
He's too young for me
Anyway, that's all I'm saying
I think, I am getting old
The audience didn't like it
I'm tired
Still, I've got homework to do
I'm tired
May I ask you a question?
Fire away.
You reckon?
This is my neighbor's pet
You are a wonderful person!
Hate it, hate it, hate it
Which city should we visit?
Let's run
It won't be long.
I hope not.
How do you see me?
I'll see you in six months
Are you a man or aren't you?
Give me a beer please!
Just watch what'll happen
How can you say such a thing!?
They're too tired to work
Who is she?
A soldier who will fight.
Okay, this is epic
Isn't Tom in your class?
You want to stay alive, right?
Sometimes I'd strangle him!
I can't express myself well
Ziri couldn't stop shaking
Ziri's dog was black
Ziri sped-walked
Ziri got to his sister's Jeep
Ziri didn't see anything ahead
The CD was sun-damaged
Ziri's room was a mess
Ziri's car was in the ditch
Ziri's studio is empty
Ziri's story is spine-chilling
Now, allow me to elaborate
Ziri wasn't in the water
Why isn't Ziri's story true?
Ziri wasn't able to help
Ziri heard a woman's voice
The baby didn't stop crying
Ziri wasn't feeling threatened
Ziri has moved far, far away
Ziri is a matter-of-fact guy
What did that man tell you?
What a cute pupper!
I haven't understood
Tom couldn't tell where he was
It'd be nice if that were true
Can I ask them a question?
May I ask them a question?

What are you hiding there?
Has he warned you?
Why have I got this?
Why do I have this?
Do you often get visitors?
Do you get visitors often?
Are all the others there?
Is everyone else there?
But I don't
I don't know this area
Don't be a spoilsport!
I'm much obliged to you
I'd like to cancel my booking
I'm here, guys
Now we'd like to study you
Who's that?
That's Tom when he was a kid.
It's late already
I wonder why?
I'm not late
Riding horses isn't easy
Poor guy, he's so skinny!
How can I pay this debt?
I'm always glad to see you
We can't get rid of Tom
I don't need you here tomorrow
What's chorizo?
It's a type of meat
It's like a spicy sausage.
Lions don't go meow
I'm going to keep on trying
I'm going to keep trying
Is Tom coming tonight?
Will Tom be coming tonight?
That's a very interesting book
We don't play cards anymore
Is Tom leaving or staying?
Tom isn't a big drinker
I'm not a religious man
I'm going to continue trying
Tom won't ever talk
You're a cop, aren't you?
I don't eat fish very often
The mermaids can fly!
Run!
I've become thinner
How did the dog get in?
I'm sleepy, so I'm going now
I'm not going to wait forever
The train leaves at two-thirty
In Russian, "тело" means "body
Ziri's company ran new tests
We've got lots of room
Is this fighter affordable?
Tom's eyes are strange
I hope everything is going OK?
Don't make me go there
Is that a silk dress?
Today's your birthday, right?
Did we travel back in time?
Thank God for atheism!
We're closing for lunch
Tom's got a rowing boat
We've hired a rowing boat
We've got a lot of room
My roof's got a leak
I've hired a rowing boat
She needs a one-bedroom flat
Tom's got a PhD
I've just moved in
I've just showered
We've just moved in
I've just emailed you
I've just sent you an email
OK, let me get this straight
I've just found an old diary
I've just got home from school
I'm just home from school
I've just received your letter
I've just got your letter
I've just remembered something
I'm sober now
You mustn't leave just yet
I'm ringing from Tom's mobile
It's now a quarter past six
It's now quarter past six
It's now 6.15
That colour doesn't suit me
I'm still using it.
Shall we listen to some music?
Is that how you thank people?
Your house is massive!
She hasn't got any
She doesn't have any
She's got none
I'd gladly help you if I could
Excuse me, who are you?
Has it actually snowed?
I've never taken Tom seriously
I've moved out already
I'm afraid that isn't possible
Half of these books are Tom's
I don't believe in soulmates
You're doing God's work
Mary says she hadn't cried
She admitted she hadn't cried
She claims she hasn't cried
She swears she hasn't cried
Tom said he'd won
I'm hunting
Are they horny?
Is he horny?
Is she horny?
Are they spicy?
He isn't very horny
She isn't very horny
It's time!
I feel as if I'm alone
We're working on a new system
I like roses, and so does Tom
How often do you go hunting?
I told Greg that I'm Buddhist
What exactly is consciousness?
Did Tom just go in there?
I hope you're willing to help
Tom can't come over tonight
Gerda disappeared!
‘Strike a pose!
Will Earth run out of food?
Everyone's nervous
Tom is very touchy-feely
I'm baby
Are they hot?
I fell hook, line and sinker
I’m a million miles away
Is the coffee still hot?
Is that wire hot?
How do hot air balloons work?
It was a hot, sunny day
It's been hot all week
Let's eat inside
Please don't feed the trolls
They're very proud of it
Tom did the washing-up
The train leaves at 2.31
It's very near here
It's very close to here
No, it doesn't have to be
No, it hasn't got to be
No, it needn't be
Those aren't carrot leaves
I'm not a qualified chef
What's in your fridge?
The stranger didn't answer
The stranger didn't reply
Shall I make some coffee?
It's only a five-minute walk
It's only five minutes on foot
Alone?" she asked, surprised
Can I ask you something?
It depends.
They've got lazy
You've got lazy
They've become lazy
You've become lazy
Don't abandon them
What's in your refrigerator?
When did Tom get here?
About three hours ago.
Don't work yourself up
Don't get yourself worked up
I'm just a lowly serf
Tom's answer was very wordy
Look!
A mockingbird!
We really need your guys' help
Wanna make somethin' of it?
I literally can't
Your lunch reeks of fish.
Ya wanna make something of it?
Are you kidding!?
French lessons are at 2:30
Get out of here, Tom
I won't discuss it with Tom
Go away, Tom
I don't want to see you here
We don't want to poke the bear
What else could endanger Tom?
Is it safe for Tom?
Are they afraid?
You lied to me?
Wanna make something of it?
Thank God I'm an atheist
We're making stuffed peppers
He's difficult to understand
He's difficult to comprehend
We don't have to stay here
I recognized Tom's handwriting
We don't need to know that
Is it safe for Tom to do that?
What man is leading them?
Who is leading them?
Not so!
I'm asleep.
A sleeper won't answer.
This won't go unpunished
Each day, his love grows
It's better to say nothing
I'd like it to stay that way
You're mistaken, professor
You're wrong, professor
Everyone's already gone in
Well, that was mad
When are you ringing?
When are you going to ring?
When are you phoning?
When will you phone?
When will you ring?
It's far better than before
What's wrong?
You'll end up in hospital
Can't we just toss a coin?
Have you just arrived?
I've dropped my torch
I've just done it
I've just finished
I've just got engaged
I've just had my hair cut
I've just found this
I've just seen it on the news
I've just told Tom
We've just got back
What colour is Tom's jumper?
I like Tom's sweater
That's an ugly sweater
Tom doesn't want to study
I haven't slept for two nights
That wall isn't plumb
The wall there isn't plumb
That wall's not plumb
You've got the skills required
Mary's been sick
We've been very busy today
I'm still using it.
Fucking finally!
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up yourself!
That's literally not possible
It's a sovereign entity
Fuck NATO's imperialist agenda
Germany can't fight Russia
It's not easy to defeat Russia
NATO can't get rid of Russia
You are not Roman, are you?
Where do you live?
Why?
She isn't Jewish
Will you be my wife?
I couldn't solve the problem
No you don't
It's easy to get sidetracked
Don't be incoherent
She can't believe it
She didn't eat the meat
What a nasty smell!
Are you cooking cauliflower?
Don't try and lick that pole
Ziri feels Rima's pain
It's flushed
It's rinsed out
It's washed and rinsed out
It's washed and flushed
You don't have to swear
You did help Tom, didn't you?
I'm very proud of what Tom did
You're too fast for me, Tom
I can't keep up with you
You are a very bad person, Tom
Wait, and you may see Tom
Tom is work-shy
Could you drive faster, Tom?
Look over there—the bus
Are you alright?
Do you want to rest today?
I'm alright now, thanks
Okay.
Who gave you my phone number?
Is it yours or mine?
69 more days until the show.
Nice.
Nice.
Are these yours or mine?
Well, I'm not a crook
Dr. Jackson owns three houses
I've seen a few episodes
Beauty doesn't last forever
I don't understand
You're looking smug
Now, we can only trust God
That's bad
Don't forget to say goodbye
Oh, if only I was rich!
You have to be well-prepared
It's still ten o'clock
Was the trip interesting?
Please don't eat me!
Trust me, bro
No one knows my name!
The devil told you that!
You can't eat money
I'm not sure
I've been there many years ago
What are you laughing at?
I don't know what else to ask
Do you work as an electrician?
I can't stand your face
Some people don't eat eggs
Can't you think of anything?
How do you cope with the heat?
I need a lie-down
Would you like to be a writer?
Why won't you give them to me?
Why won't you give it to me?
Don't lean against the wall
It's just been painted
Don't lean against the wall
It's fresh paint
Thanks for the correction!
I'm not trying to be a hero
I've just met your mum
I've just bumped into your mum
I've just sold that
I'm mad about football
Is Tom still in hospital?
We've missed our bus
On your knees!
We're planning to go by bus
It'll be a three-hour bus ride
Hannah!
Leah!
As I live and breathe!
You're back!
I am!
How the devil are you?
Have you got time for a pint?
Bit of a catch-up?
I'm here whenever you need me
Why did you learn Cantonese?
When did Tom last visited you?
Shall we have a beer with Tom?
Are there any more cookies?
Muğla is a province of Turkey
I know what he's up to
What is your name?
My name is Charles.
You're a gross person!
Have you already had dinner?
Not yet.
Congrats!
I am the non-breaking cause
At what time can you start?
If you don't know, don't speak
He mentions "bullet trains.
I guess I've been lucky
More than I can count.
I'd like to join the club
That'll land Tom in jail
I'd missed a call from Tom
It's way better than before
It's a lot better than before
It's much better than before
Ziri's work ended up rushed
Ziri's work ended up botched
Try out Ziri's method
I hope you're still on my side
That's not weed
This isn't blow
Tom, don't drink that
It's not beer
It's... too late
Let's abolish work
That isn't grass
That isn't snow
She's weak
I want to take part, too
This bird's wings are broken
That's not cocaine
What's your aim on Tatoeba?
It's not that simple
My wife, actually
No, she's from Middlesbrough.
He's not coming until Sunday
I've just learnt that
I've just been studying that
She's eighteen
How often are you there?
I'll be at yours at eight
I'll be at your place at eight
It's somewhat further away
It's a bit further away
That's a bit further away
Is that right?
José scored a header
Don't give up
It's like a drunken amphibian
I'm going for a walk with her
Can you fill in this form?
It's scorching hot
Does she come from here?
Has Tom been in touch?
No, not yet.
Tom's projecting
You're projecting
That's projection
It's East Indian cuisine
That's a bootleg cartridge
I'm not ugly, am I?
Tom's racket broke
Tom's paddle broke
Tom's oar broke
It's Tom's day off
Is speaking French hard?
Tom's French is pretty bad
Now it's up to us
Come right this way, please
I've lost my gloves
Whither?
I'm looking for a job for Tom
What's life like in Algeria?
I guess it's a trap
We're citizen scientists
We're citizen journalists
I don't know why anymore
Tom must've fallen asleep
We're not all the same
Did you record the concert?
I've got only one left
How would you translate that?
Could you cancel my booking?
Could you cancel our booking?
He'll throw a wobbly
He'll throw a tantrum
He's throwing a tantrum
He's throwing a wobbly
Have you seen my mobile?
It's on the table.
We've got to get to hospital
What river are you on about?
Do you mean this stream?
Only joking!
I'm fit to drop
I'm going to bed
I'm off to bed
I'll visit you next Sunday
You don't need to apologise
You needn't apologise
Tom wasn't wearing any clothes
I'm the answer to your prayer
We don't see eye to eye
It's too late to start over
Taking a break isn't giving up
I guess it's what I have to do
Good riddance to bad rubbish!
It's OK to make a mistake
You don't need anything
Ziri can't really start over
Are there any sausages left?
Tom wasn't a good dancer
Tom isn't a linear thinker
See these scratches?
That's the sign of a cat owner
Tom doesn't bother me anymore
It's your hit, Tom
Hey, Tom, it's your hit
I don't care, Cookie
We'll see you back tomorrow
You're a sophist
Why do you use Proton Mail?
Why don't you?
You dummy!
And you are?
No, Tom
Pick up your toys.
It doesn't matter
Do it again.
But can it really be done?
But, can you really do that?
I didn't
Why?
Because I'm a procrastinator
Can this wait?
I'm busy here
Cookie.
Ow!
That wouldn't be fun to eat.
Don't yuck someone else's yum
It wasn't about you
Raccoons are so big!
Don't kill skunks
Don't kill any animal
I didn't know when to stop
I hope you'll help me escape
Meow?
Yes.
Who would believe you?
Um . .
Psst!
Mary!
Do you intend to write on it?
Yeah.
Then I don't want it back.
My pad's soaked
Can I borrow one of yours?
Here's one
That's not what I said, though
Is this actually a $100 bill?
Yeah, check out the watermark.
I'm reading a gripping story
He's better than I am at maths
He's better than me at maths
He's better at maths than I am
Could you show me that tie?
He's poorer than ever
He's poorer than ever before
It's no use giving him advice
I've just had a brilliant idea
They're just back from school
Where were you?
Where were you?
How wide is this street?
They still make MP3 players?
What is frankincense, anyway?
Some sort of monster?
Tom's vexation was evident
Yes.
We've arranged a parley
Something's up with Tom
I am.
Sure I am.
Unfortunately, I've no idea
It's time to end this circus
Go figure!
No quarter !
I'd love to be a cat
Tom's fursona is a lion
Mary's fursona is a bat
Isn't your fursona a ferret?
It's quiet here
I love your site!
You demand a lot, and quickly
These aren't related
Can we talk this week?
There's no link
Where's the link?
You're practically an expert
We don't own this place
Have you fed the porch cats?
What's Caller ID?
Is a burrito a sandwich?
That's why I have this name
I'm a former drug addict
It’s a nice day to start again
Let’s start again!
Tom didn't buy anything there
Tom didn't recommend it to us
I drive my father's car
It is necessary to sail!
When Tom comes, you can start
I'm lost
What's perdition?
When will we see Tom again?
Tom could've waited for us
Hi Susanna!
What's up?
The sea is calling!
Spain is in south-west Europe
I can feel it in my bones!
I've brought a sack of spuds
Where's John?
We put on make-up
We've put on make-up
Have you already met Tom?
A likeable young man.
You've changed
Who's that over there?
I think he's called Tom.
What?
Him as well?
You can't do anything today
Tom's got no idea about DIY
We can't wait any longer
I can come straight away.
Let's see if I can tomorrow
I think I've got enough paint
I don't fancy going shopping
Tom's flat is cluttered
I will check Tom's work
I cannot teach you, Tom
She's a girl.
You mean she's a woman?
I mean she's too young.
I'm afraid I can't teach you
I didn't think of anything
We can't always flee from them
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe Tom's the problem
Tom's free kick hit the wall
Thanks, everyone
I'm staying too
Just a second!
In summer, it wasn't a problem
That's really not on
That's really not acceptable
I think they're ravioli
How do you like my glasses?
I don't feel quite right
He's sober as a judge
She's three sheets to the wind
She's bladdered
She's blind drunk
It was pitch-dark in the cave
He's had one too many
I'm glad to be home at last
Why were you late?
Anger is a double-edged sword
Can cats have flax milk?
Can cats have salami?
Should cats have salami?
I hate magicians!
Tom liked Mary's hair
He won't invent gunpowder
I will go rigth to Tom's place
Meow!
Meow?
Meow!!
Did you drink water today?
I don't know what he was doing
I don't know what he's doing
I don't know what I was doing
Rest in pizza, Gorbachev
Hail Gorbachev!
In the end, he did it anyway
Will you do it for Tom?
I'm looking
Literally nothing.
You used to be an airman?
Is it movable?
Can you give me some space?
Can you give me some space?
Of course.
Sorry.
Do it as often as you need to.
May I get in?
Yes, for sure!
Go straight ahead!
No, I don't think I will
I might've made a mistake
How many kanji do you know?
I'm afraid of sentences
I'm glad to finally be home
They're at university
We'll certainly miss Tom
Where's Keira?
I'll ask him when he comes
I'll ask him when he arrives
I'll ask him when he gets here
There wasn't a bathroom there
He's got a black eye
What happened?
Could I have a different room?
He went in his father's stead
That day was my 23rd birthday
Where's your cousin?
He's just left.
I've just spoken to her
Is Tom here?
No, he's just left.
Really?
It's just started to rain
Tell her I'm ill
That's a load of claptrap
That's a load of tosh
I can't keep my eyes off it
I daren't go and speak to Mary
Then at least you'll know.
How seriously ill is Tom?
We fear the worst.
Tom doesn't drink sweet tea
I’m in a snake back situation
I don't know what Tom ate
Tell Tom I'm not interested
I loved meeting your kitties!
I like Tom, warts and all
When would you like to go?
We've both done our share
I can't see your face
He's a cat.
Could you fix my flat tire?
Were you at school yesterday?
Don't tell me it's all over
Do you know Mr Qian?
Do you know Mr Gao?
Now go ahead, put your feet up
He's a cunning thief
He's a devious thief
I don't seem to belong here
I couldn't find my hat
Tom must've heard me wrong
Where will the wedding be?
That's just gobbledegook!
What made you say no?
Open the door, will you?
Nobody's going to stop us now
Pity he's left
It's a shame he's left
It wasn't dear
Can you mend my flat tyre now?
Can you mend my puncture now?
We've never met
It's a shame Tom's not with us
We've got a problem.
What is it this time?
There's that man again
It's worked until now
Tom's just started
I've only just got here
I've just realised something
I've just seen a huge owl
I've just read a book
He's just gone out
I've just finished that
I've just finished it
I've just finished doing it
She's just missed the train
He's just eaten
I've just thought of something
It's a goal
What's your favourite colour?
My favourite colour is ochre.
Tom doesn't know his father
I'm eating your banana
What used to be here?
What was here before?
Give me my book back!
What book?
I'm going to Japan in 2020
I'm not that famous
I'm not as famous
Where are his accomplices?
We haven't been to Slovakia
Tom's dog is old
I don't have any parents
I'm not all that famous
Why not apply here?
Aww!
Yeah, that too.
I've been working since dawn
Do both of you speak French?
Me too!
Thank you!
You helped a lot!
Can you do it without Tom?
It's Tom's turn now
How did you get to the zoo?
I'm doing the best that I can
Why?
Is it because of Tom?
Yes, it is.
You don't care about Tom
Tom's campaign was successful
I'll wash the dishes myself
Tom's going apeshit
I'm not a superstitious person
This is my wife's car
I can't come here every day
It's a lovely vermilion color
Tom says that it's his
I knew that it wasn't yours
I knew it wasn't yours
First, ignorance is not bliss
Too bad!
I'll wash my own dishes
I'm going for a walk with Tom
Tom doesn't eat eggs anymore
That's right
I love coffee.
I'll phone you after lunch
What do you think?
Evening!
All right?
I don't think she's happy
Will you be voting?
Do you prefer red or blue?
My favourite colour is purple.
That's just a wig!
It's not a wig!
That's a wig
You've got rats in your cellar
He's a real alpha male
I'll ring him before I go out
I'll phone him before I go out
I'm asking not him, but you
I'm too tired for that now
John's got a brilliant idea
Happy Fake Labor Day!
Is it really that difficult?
I don't have another one
That's not why I'm calling you
What do you collect?
What's the budget?
Tom thinks it's a bad idea
You've got someone to live for
Do you still have doubts?
I doubt she'll come
What tools should I bring?
When are you guys coming back?
I'm a bot
Is there another entrance?
That's what he was counting on
Italian.
Come to Boston!
You'll love it here
We're Jews
It'll be arriving early
Do you want to go to school?
How can I contact him?
She'll find out anyway
We'll talk on the way
Yo, what's good?
You've changed
Above all, don't be selfish
Do we disgust you?
I don't have a fever anymore
You could've left
He's following me
Tom left with Mary?
We'll be helping you
Does she like reading books?
That's his voice
I've been to Beijing twice
You didn't want Mary to die
Thank you, too!
You helped me a lot!
Are you guys angry?
Are you guys mad?
They're offended
They're mad
I don't want it at all
It's a countable noun
Was Tom offended?
It's probably not her
Is that today's newspaper?
Give me a knife, please
That's why we stayed home
It's crazy
What's the deal with that?
We'll go even if it rains
I'll clean my room later
I don't want your tie
If you come, that's enough
We've survived a plane crash
Where can I meet up with you?
I'm a busy man right now
Tom wouldn't clean the dishes
I'm really worried
Where's the fruit?
Let's use money carefully
I'm not going to spy on her
Why do they hate John so much?
What did he do to them?
I don't know
I opened Pandora's box
We've only just moved in
Pretend like you don't care
Good thing I didn't go
It's easy to check
How many of you were there?
You didn't miss anything
It's raining goals
It was bedlam!
Should I reply to this letter?
Should I answer this letter?
First, let me congratulate you
It's an imitation
Finally, luck smiled on us
I can't read minds yet
This medicine doesn't help
This medicine isn't helping
This medicine's not helping
Can you prove your claims?
I'm still tired
I'm going back to bed
He's not my superior
I wasn't expecting a present
I've mislaid my glasses
Do you want some more sauce?
How do you want your tea?
Milk, no sugar.
Fancy a brew?
Not half!
Put the kettle on, will you?
I'm parched
I wasn't expecting a gift
No, this isn't your bag
Let's keep it that way
Did Tom get offended?
Now, wake up
Do you like card tricks?
No, I hate card tricks.
I'll show you one anyway.
I'm a nobody to you
You think I'm boring; admit it
You idiots!
That's of no use to anyone
That's of no use to anybody
It's complete
I'd like to be Picasso
We're influencers
There're different interests
Is it that important to you?
He's wearing trunks
You shouldn't hit me!
You've found me!
You found me!
We don't talk anymore
I'd want to
He didn't turn off the engine
Has he found her?
Did he find her?
Has he found them?
Did he find them?
Is there a late fee?
It's been a very long day
I don't think this is a crime
This isn't a crime, is it?
What did they drink?
The less I hear, the better
They are smart, aren't they?
A coffee with sugar, please
I think I'm not normal
Don't talk if you don't know
Let's question them!
Let's interrogate them!
You can't do that to us!
It smells like death in here!
You, Mary and I were approved
Would you go to college today?
Nobody wants children.
Hi!
How are you?
I'm doing well.
Was Tom in German class?
Why does Tom not remember me?
I can't play with him
It's a saying
Is there a dark theme?
That was my sister's voice
I'm a fast thinker
Were they told the truth?
What does the doctor say?
That's easy for you to say!
Are you going to talk?
He didn't speak much
Really?
Are you being serious?
We're talking to Mary
Listen to what he's saying!
Juan didn't speak much French
No, I'm not a teacher
I'm just a student
Are you a cop?
Tom is an old friend of Mary's
Why doesn't Tom remember me?
Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins
1 part is called satoshi
I'd stay home tonight
Wake up, times have changed!
It was quite an eye-opener
Happy 9/11!
Hope it's a good one
Don't underestimate the value
You're looking tan, Tom
That isn't representative
You've never asked me about it
What's an 8-track?
Where's my watch?
Did you take it?
Tom liked Mary's smile
You're looking svelte
Do you think he was killed?
Tom wasn't feeling very well
Did you enjoy the book?
I'm sure Tom agrees with this
I'm talking about human beings
We won't be ready until 2:30
When do you guys close?
I didn't trust him at all
I arrived a bit too early.
We've seen it all
Don't push yourself too hard

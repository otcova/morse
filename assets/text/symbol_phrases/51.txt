It's a risk we need to take
Yanni was a mercenary.
Pardon me?
He was a killer.
Let's go buy it
Let's go bring it
Let's go see it
Let's go do it
Is the Pope Catholic?
That depends.
What?
The who?
How are your goats?
I'm allergic to doing homework
Yanni doesn't have many goats
Yanni's goat has parasites
Yanni's goats are really loud
Yanni's goats are really small
Are you a Hebrew teacher?
That just won't happen
Did you go numb?
Tom's left-handed
She didn't tell the truth
This time, I have a plan
What is tellurium used for?
Tom isn't scared to do that
I'd like to sit over there
Did Tom say otherwise?
Such bad luck!
She's holding a cat
Educated, him?
Don't tell that!
Are you sure no one saw you?
If I have time, I'll help you
What did Tom do last weekend?
Tom isn't a history teacher
Those people don't know me
Stop being silly and go do it.
What was the atmosphere like?
I'm bad at reading maps
Throw him to the lions!
This room's too small
Do you believe them?
I can't forgive this
It'll be ready right away
It'll ready in just a moment
Do we have enough rice?
How long does this take?
The wall won't hold them back
Get down from there!
I'm not getting off it
I'll read you a story
He ripped me off!
He screwed me!
He sold me out!
He betrayed me!
Who might want to frame you?
Do you drink green tea often?
Who would want to set you up?
Who would want to frame you?
Tom isn't our oldest member
Don't get fooled
You can't mislead me
Don't get tricked
They've lost everything
I wasn't trying to be a hero
Are you off to save the day?
I'm not that good at languages
Does she pass by here?
Where's that brainiac?
So, what do you think?
I did pretty good, huh?
You did alright.
It's just a mild stroke
It's nothing but a mild stroke
How would you pronounce it?
How would you express it?
That's just my two cents
Can I get a new dress?
No, and stop asking for one.
I think that's kind of stupid
I think that's kinda dumb
I think that's kinda stupid
How did they feel?
Tom isn't drinking red wine
Can it get even cheaper?
I don't tolerate such conduct
I don't tolerate screw-ups
I don't tolerate amateurs
I don't tolerate swindlers
I can't afford incompetence
That's a load of rubbish
That's a lot of nonsense
That's a bunch of nonsense
Can you snap your fingers?
What are you watching now?
Are there too many for you?
All hands on deck!
If you help me, I'll help you
Hahaha!
That's a very good idea!
Tom isn't the lead vocalist
He's one of the backup singers
Haha, very funny
I love chocolate ice cream!
Have you ever rented a car?
Do you know why Tom got fired?
They don't eat a thing
Do you know why Tom resigned?
Who came to visit Tom?
Tom isn't in the greenhouse
Yanni is Skura's secret love
She has a sexy voice.
Yanni is staring at the food.
He's probably angry.
Yanni touched Skura's hand
Yanni brushed Skura's hand
Yanni copies Skura's behavior
Yanni can't do this right now
Yanni focuses on Skura's flaws
I'm not proud of you
That won't change anytime soon
What color are Tom's socks?
When are you going to go home?
Well, let's play it by ear
What's your happiest memory?
Lisa is Bryan's girlfriend
You're an asshole!
Caifeng, I like your name
It isn't such a long flight
It's not such a long flight
Is this cap Tom's?
Do rabbits eat acorns?
Look who's watching!
I'd put less thyme
I didn't drink one drop today
I won't go till tomorrow
He really doesn't like that
Yes, like it was yesterday.
What did Tom want to drink?
He's dumb as a rock
Tom ran to Mary's aid
Tom ran away, screaming
Do you really care about me?
Let's join the parade
I'm ready to join your club
It's nice of you to join us
We'd better join the others
Women aren't allowed to join
How much does it cost to join?
It's a pity you can't join us
I've agreed to join Tom's band
You can join, or not
It's your choice
Why didn't you?
Tom isn't Mary's assistant
He's mine
It'll rain today, for sure
What's new?
Whose car is it?
Do you know?
Do you know whose car it is?
Is your sister's name Mary?
May I ask where you're going?
I don't think it's random
May I ask what you're doing?
May I ask where you live?
Yesterday, I went to the opera
It'll soon be Valentine's Day
Valentine's Day is next week
Could you wipe off the table?
It's very sticky
That's pure madness
That's total madness
He's a real daredevil
It's getting cooler
That's a surprise to me
His father doesn't trust him
I'd like shoes like that
Tom's parents don't trust him
How long did the picnic last?
Did you ever act on a hunch?
How do you know?
It's just a hunch.
How is it that you know that?
He's going for his gun!
He's going for his rifle!
Would that be allowed?
Would they let us do that?
Will they let us do that?
I know you can't resist
Meat isn't cheap
You're unemployed, aren't you?
Are you still unemployed?
It's unbearable to listen to
Is this really mine?
Is this really yours?
I can't hear any more of this
We're not armed
Now you've got to listen to me
I'm arriving on October 20th
I'm arriving October 20th
I'll be arriving October 20th
Do you mean that I was right?
We've all been praying for you
Could you give some examples?
He's quite the hunk!
He's quite a bit older than me
Of course, it's a joke
This gun isn't loaded
I've run out of clean clothes
It was like that, before
You don't seem too certain
I don't think I'll have time
Why will I open it ?
Bad disease, get away from it
Here's where we disagree
They will turn to Sidi-AÃ¯ch
You did it for free?
Stop it!
You're tickling me!
I don't want your religion
Just once can't hurt
Have you completely lost it?
Can she swallow this fig ?
It's time fo me to eat
It's red like blood
Things aren't what they seem
Don't be precious
It's full
Are you game?
Shall I give you an account?
Does the tooth hurt?
Do you see?
She didn't even touch it
Oh God, what shall we do?
I don't see why it's a problem
That means it's healing
He's American to the core
Does he believe in us?
I'm eclectic
Dress up!
There's nothing to say
Did anybody get arrested?
We didn't let it affect us
I'm the ghost of Tom Jackson
I'm not a miracle worker
Tom isn't a miracle worker
I'm going shopping?
Do you want to come?
Don't ask why
Where did Tom die?
That's just a dream
There's a cat on my table
Don't believe that rumor
You're the light of my life
Doing that wouldn't be smart
If I had, we'd have apples now
We'll be there by dawn
Things could've ended badly
How are your mom and dad?
We don't know the results yet
That's awfully specific
It's very discouraging
We don't yet know the results
I'm a newspaper reporter
For what reason did you come?
You can't use my scissors
Yanni won't leave Skura alone
Yanni's marriage is over
Yanni didn't change a thing
Yanni doesn't want the house
Yanni's house is different
Yanni's car had a GPS in it
Yanni's new car is his baby
Yanni's gun is in the glovebox
I'm in love with you, Yanni
Yanni wasn't a wimp
Did you like the gift?
Did you like my gift?
Yanni is Skura's future spouse
Yanni and Skura are co-workers
Yanni is Skura's assistant
Who was it that helped you?
Yanni doesn't do men
Yanni isn't gay
He doesn't do man
What has gotten into your dad?
Jugurtha is a Berber name.
You're a liar and a racist!
Jugurtha is a Kabyle name!
Was Yanni seeing anyone?
What game do you like best?
Perhaps I'm worrying too much
Didn't you ask?
Do you think it's reliable?
Do you think it's trustworthy?
Please don't post that.
Yanni murdered Skura's brother
Yanni destroyed Skura's family
Yanni touched Skura's arm
How fortuitous!
I'm turning red
He's turning red
We're turning red
They're turning red
You good-for-nothing!
He's just a good-for-nothing
Does she speak Berber?
He's just a no-goodnik
Does Yanni speak Berber?
Does Skura speak Berber?
He's just a nogoodnik
Do they speak Berber?
Will you stop us?
Will Skura stop us?
Will Yanni and Skura stop us?
Will Skura and Nuja stop us?
Will they stop us?
He's just a ne'er-do-well
He's just a nobody
He's reaching for his gun!
He's reaching for his rifle!
Would I be eligible for that?
Let's hope
Let's hope that's the case
I can't get the door to open
He's an entitled little shit
Where can I see the full list?
It's a gift for you
Thanks, but I'd rather not
I'll have to decline
Who's a good boy?
I don't speak Esperanto
The store opens at ten o'clock
You can't rely on what he says
Don't set the alarm off
What triggered the sensor?
What tripped the sensor?
I'm sure nobody will mind
I'm sure no one will mind
You shouldn't act prematurely
Don't act prematurely
Hopefully, we can keep it up
He's just a loser
What did Tom want to see?
Who asked that question?
Is your suitcase heavy?
And what's new with you?
We didn't panic
It's sleeting
Can I talk with Miss Brown?
I don't like Tom's music
I don't like Tom's brother
Cool tattoo!
Careful; Tom's a bit sensitive
That's a cool tattoo
That's a cool-looking tattoo
I wouldn't ever get a tattoo
Nice tattoo!
Your position isn't tenable
I'm worried Tom is in a cult
It's such a long flight
It's such a long flight!
It's a very long flight
We're going skiing tomorrow
Tom can't act
You'd better act fast
You'd better act quickly
It's a hard act to follow
We'll have to act quickly
Now, it's your turn to act
Tom didn't act quickly
That's a tough act to follow
I acted on Tom's advice
Don't act like you don't know
You should act like grown-ups
Don't try acting like you care
The first act wasn't very good
Tom acted like I didn't exist
Mary didn't act like a lady
I don't like this shirt either
How are you doing that?
Show me how you're doing that?
I'm the designated driver
In fact, quite the opposite
Yanni called Skura's house
Yanni closed Skura's casket
Yanni did call 911
I'm leaving the talking to you
Yanni's glory days are over
Yanni's wife just left him
Yanni embodies Skura's failure
Yanni died in Skura's arms
Don't leave me here like this
What's gonna happen to Yanni?
Do you like numerology?
Yanni rehabbed Skura's house
Tom pretended he didn't notice
Whose baseball glove is this?
Don't be scared
I'm scared of being alone
I'm scared of being on my own
There's nowhere for me to go
It's not raining
It's snowing
Can Tom write his name?
I didn't really like this book
He's just a bastard
He's just a scumbag
He's just a lowlife
I'll help you pay for it
Tom isn't my brother
You'll die!
Is that even true, though?
Is that true, though?
What to do in such weather?
Why weren't you answering?
Let them!
Let it go!
Have you ever swum naked?
We're going to California
You can come, too
He's liberal-minded
You dork!
You nerd!
I'm going back in time
See you last year!
That's Tom's duty
Eat shit!
Who does that car belong to?
Is Tom able to write his name?
Words can't express it
That's what I tried to express
Why haven't you responded?
Why haven't you answered?
Tom still works here, right?
Tom's expression softened
Tom's expression darkened
Do dogs dream?
Do cats daydream?
Do cats have daydreams?
What a cool tattoo!
Do we need your permission?
Yanni paid for Skura's money
That's an embarrassing topic
I think we're being watched
These shoes don't fit me
Someone's stolen my bicycle
Somebody's stolen my bicycle
Do you like figs?
Do you like figs?
Everyone likes figs.
How do you eat a fig?
You can eat the whole thing.
Which fig do I eat first?
What are figs good for?
How do you eat figs?
That's too much.
Why are these figs wet?
How much is a kilo of figs?
This fig is not really sweet?
Why are these figs bitter?
Do you like fig jam?
Do you have fig jam?
If I don't cheat, I won't win
Yanni wasn't paying the bills
It was Yanni's body
Yanni was Skura's husband
Yanni's eyes were swollen
Yanni's eyes were red
Your lips are so sweet.
And you're an amazing kisser.
Do you remember me?
I'm not sure.
I'm Skura.
Skura Mellal?
Yes.
You look amazing.
Thank you.
He's a sex addict
Yanni's judgment was poor
You again?
Let's go talk to him.
Lead the way.
Let's go get some fresh figs
It's a lot windy up here
Yanni's hands are sticky
Yanni's favorite fruit is figs
What do fresh figs taste like?
Don't eat those figs
They're moldy
Why don't we sit over there?
Whose hat is this?
It's Tom's.
I'm going to divorce Skura.
Are you sick in the head?
Yanni is out of jail.
God help us.
Yanni is out of jail.
God be with us.
I'll never back down
Spiders are ugly.
All spiders are ugly.
That's just silly
Oh, nice
Let's sit close to the front
I'd like to ride your new bike
Who's your favorite actress?
I can't wait to begin
The camera is Tom's
We can't do that tomorrow
We didn't want that to happen
Give Tom more time, please
I'm not a unicorn
It shouldn't happen again!
How far is New York from here?
What do cats dream about?
My desk was behind Tom's
What do dogs dream about?
I'm not from Boston originally
Me at least, I can face them!
We at least, we can face them!
Tom waxed Mary's car for her
However, we don't do funerals
She's a crybaby
That shouldn't happen again
I'll try to help him
I'll try to help Tom
I'm going to try to help Tom
It's risky and dangerous
Don't play dumb
Do you like talking?
She's one of my best friends
How long were you sick for?
They didn't lose hope
I get it now!
You're my sister
She hasn't decided yet
Yes, he's home
Anything else to add?
Do you believe in me?
Answer the damn phone!
He doesn't have pride
Let's play in the beach
I'd never seen so much money
Imagine that he's reading it
They weren't angry
Were you home?
I've lost a bit of weight
I'm probably getting a cold
Don't drop them
I can't miss out
Oh, I know where we are now
He won't stop calling me
She won't stop calling me
Did I fall in love with her?
Did you like it?
I'm proud of my country
Did she read this article?
I'm bisexual
For me, five
I'm a fan of Nesquik!
She's an idiot
Thanks for your advice, Arnau
Blimey, today wasn't Saturday?
Why's Tom putting on his coat?
Why's Tom putting his coat on?
Is it over there?
Whose is it?
You don't work as much as I do
I'd say at least fifty years.
What?
How can that be?
Who rescued Tom?
Their bodies were torn up..
I don't like to talk about it
Tom wasn't left in charge
You're wrong, so don't shout
It's not feeding time
Let's all stay calm
You're a liar.
What?
You're a liar.
Yanni's backyard is a mess
I've discovered the truth
Do you guys feel exhausted?
Do you feel exhausted?
Do you all feel exhausted?
Yanni's world was crumbling
Have you looked at the data?
Huh?
What was I going to do, again?
Technically, Yanni was insane
Yanni wasn't in his right mind
He filed for a divorce in 2004
I'm divorcing Skura.
You can't second-guess a jury
Yanni's life shattered
Let's go pick some figs
Can you get to it?
Bird poop contains minerals.
Yuck!
This fig tree is Yanni's baby
How many figs have you eaten?
Yanni's favorite snack is figs
They're for you
Never eat a fig's stem
That's a good fig
They're good for health
What does a fig taste like?
Let's taste these figs
Tom isn't Mary's stepfather
He's her biological father
I couldn't get the safe open
Of course, I'm joking
As the sun rose, we set off
Do you know that for certain?
I'll give it some more thought
I would've gotten bored by now
That's very kind
You're looking well, darling
You don't look well, Agnes
I'm going to the mall
Do you want to go with me?
That's TMI
There's no need to leave
Can I keep it?
Whose pencils are these?
They're Tom's.
The concert won't last long
I can't go at nine
I don't like blue cheese
Who are you guys talking to?
Is racism a serious issue?
I've been really busy lately
Is that real money?
I'm going on holiday in August
That's pure racism
I'll find the solution
I'll leave if you want me to
I'm glad that I went
Are you suffering?
Mary, don't leave!
I do love you!
Blah blah blah!
That's just what you think!
She couldn't take it anymore
Mentally I'm in England
Is Tom normal?
I'd advise against doing that
Whose sunglasses are these?
They're Tom's.
Tom's skin gets dry easily
Mary's skin gets dry easily
What's inside the box?
There's a box inside the box
Tom bought one, and so did I
He just doesn't like them
Tom isn't too busy to help
He just doesn't want to
Is this one of ours?
How long do you need my bike?
Yanni's career faltered
Yanni's mother hit him
Skura's husband was unemployed
What was in Yanni's notebook?
Yanni's first job was a busboy
Skura was Yanni's backbone
Don't waste electricity!
Don't waste water!
Don't waste gas!
I can't solve that problem
I've not been to work
I've stayed at home all day
How long will this cold last?
This river's water is clean
Her story can't be false
Do you have a book to read?
Yanni started smoking, too
Yanni didn't see the shooter
He's is very athletic
Yanni is very self-centered
Don't run!
Sociopaths don't like anyone
I don't mind doing the dishes
Sociopaths are ill-tempered
Do you wanna bet?
Yanni's parrot eats figs
Is fig jam healthy?
Yanni's fig jam is delicious
We won't sit in the front
He finished him!
That's why they blame us!
That's why they're ranting!
Those glasses must be Tom's
Who painted that picture?
Now I feel very self-conscious
I'm in love with that woman
Has Tom eaten?
May his name be erased!
Why are you worried about me?
That sounds bitter, but clear
Whose shoes are these?
They're Tom's.
He's stalking you
Who do these shoes belong to?
To Tom.
She's a rich woman
She's a rich person
He's as rich as Rockefeller
I'm burning my bridges
Me too, he drove me crazy
Mary's a feminist
I'm looking for my umbrella
I thought the gun was Tom's
So how do you find Mary?
She looks rather unusual.
So what do you think of Mary?
I don't want to offend anyone
He hasn't noticed
Let's get Tom
I feel like I'm a companion
You're sweating buckets
Well, of course, I did that
We don't care where we stay
I'm the one who should stay
Tom says that Mary won't stay
Tom says Mary won't stay
Tom stayed by Mary's side
Tom knew Mary couldn't stay
Tom says Mary can't stay long
Tom says Mary won't stay long
I'm on my way
I can't stay for the meeting
We can't stay in here forever
I'll stay and help you
You're a sailor, aren't you?
I'm putting it in the box
I wouldn't say I'm radical
Will Tom stay long?
I'm trying to stay positive
Octopuses are blue-blooded
You've got to stay focused
Did Tom stay very long?
How long will Tom stay?
Tom can't stay alone
Will Tom be staying the night?
Is Tom staying the night?
Yanni was around Skura's age
Don't push me
I'll do it
Sociopaths are very hot-headed
Yanni can't reverse
I hate you.
I hate you, too.
What the hell is this?
Yanni knew Skura's handwriting
Is it too late for love?
I can't find it on this map
I haven't had sex in a while
Yanni doesn't date
I'm busy looking for a flat
There's a conference coming up
Yanni hasn't come home in days
Yanni wasn't family-oriented
Yanni didn't get help
Yanni didn't call the police
Make him leave!
I'm pregnant and it's Yanni's
I'm filing for a divorce.
What?
You can't do that!
Skura is still Yanni's wife
Don't say anything
Yes, but not on a date
I'm not interested.
Don't worry about that.
For Tom, doing that was easy
Yanni loves Skura's figs
That's what people want to buy
Whose mittens are these?
Is rainwater drinkable?
Languages don't work like that
Which do you prefer?
This one or that one?
Tom must be a friend of Mary's
I wouldn't buy that either
This phone is Tom's
Whose pencils are these?
I'm exclusive with him
I'd like to keep doing this
We were created like that!
I'm sick of being here
Come on, get up
Of course, we have to comply
Are you good at physics?
Why did you buy a motorcycle?
I'll work till the day I die
We'll stay here and fight
I guess I'll have to stay home
Is Tom staying at a hotel?
Tom should've stayed away
Why don't you stay for dinner?
Tom stayed up late, studying
I'll stay for a while
I'd like to stay here forever
Why did Tom decide to stay?
Tom won't be staying the night
It's below freezing now
You're a waiter, aren't you?
I don't want Tom to stay here
I'll stay
I'll stay
Did you stay at Tom's long?
There's no use crying for help
I'm hungover
What will they do to save Tom?
Tom came to us, weeping
I'll know someday
Someday, I'll know
Are you a good person?
How much money will I need?
She doesn't like us
Please don't trouble yourself
I'm scared of it
That's what Tom told Mary
You can't buy trust
Who's your superior?
What drink do you like best?
I'm really in a bind
Tom doesn't need Mary
We'll never be able to do that
I'll be staying with Tom
You'd better stop lying
He's only a pharmacist
Tom hasn't found Mary
Tom hasn't seen Mary
Tom couldn't find his class
Did you give him money?
That's strongly discouraged
I wasn't affected by the flood
That means it's healing
It's normal for wounds to itch
That means they're healing
I bet that nothing'll happen
I bet nothing'll happen
Most people feel that's wrong
Most people think that's wrong
You're still very young
Frogs don't have necks
May I ask you for a favor?
It'll probably snow
It's time for us to eat
Why would you leave Boston?
Why would you leave Boston?
You're living the dream here
Here's a hot take
Yanni threw food at me.
Kids will be kids.
Her name is Skura.
Is she beautiful?
Her name is Skura.
How old is she?
It's his life
Last night, I had a good sleep
I don't need much sleep
Tell Tom that I'm asleep
We'll all sleep better tonight
Tom's speech put me to sleep
Tom couldn't fall back asleep
The children can't sleep
Tom isn't getting enough sleep
Yanni's mother was snooty
Yanni's daughter got wild
Why not?
It's seven o'clock
Yanni is here.
I'm on my way.
Whose sleeping bag is this?
I didn't sleep on the airplane
Tom is in his room, sleeping
I couldn't sleep that night
After a while, Tom fell asleep
Tom said Mary wasn't sleepy
Have you ever slept in class?
It's not Yanni Ziri wants
It's Skura
Tom didn't sleep that night
Yanni's car broke down
Take me to my mom.
The car has just broken down.
You've got to be kidding me
Call a cab, then.
Come on, Skura.
Call a cab!
Now it's Yanni's turn
Do you eat fig jam?
The fig jam isn't ready yet
These figs are very soft.
They're completely ripe.
Everybody loves figs, I guess
This radio doesn't work
Our refrigerator doesn't work
Why?
Yanni isn't taking Skura back
Mary doesn't have the virus
Don't tempt fate!
There's got to be a solution
I think it's the best option
I think that's the best option
Tom corrected Mary's essay
They're only rumours
I don't fancy it
Sugar is water-soluble
Did Tom find Mary?
You can't buy these in a store
Now it's clouded over
Are we in Paris?
He's not been here for a while
Do you trust God?
Did he sell his soul?
He didn't ask us either
Of course, we'll be there
Thanks for your advice, Tom
They're in favor of your plan
I won't sit in the back
It's important to be on time
How much paper do you need?
I wish you a long life!
I don't know how to skate
Did Tom tell Mary?
Tom is missing Mary, I'm sure
Tom's mother's name isn't Mary
You shouldn't have drunk that
He's just a pharmacist
He's said to be a good doctor
It's not easy to do this
Tom remembers Mary, I think
You have a meeting, right?
I'm sick, so I'm not coming
We'll go to California
Mary isn't my girlfriend
We'll go to Boston
Is it snowing where you are?
We're not obligated to do that
We aren't obligated to do that
I'm sick, so I'm not going
I'm sick, so I won't go
We'll get off at the last stop
Do all of youl feel exhausted?
Are all of you tired?
Can you get the door for me?
Your lies don't deceive me
Alex isn't my partner
They're just a friend
Time passes, and things change
Yanni's behavior is strange
I'll get off at the last stop
Yanni took Skura's side
Yanni doesn't joke
Yanni doesn't joke about this
Are you of age?
When will you be of age?
Don't be such a chump!
Yanni didn't have a clue
Yanni couldn't believe it
Yanni killed Skura's mother
Yanni wasn't out of control
Yanni's career was fantastic
Yanni's house is too messy
Are you scared of snakes?
Don't leave me here all alone
It's my husband
I said don't touch me!
Yanni, calm down!
I can explain.
I don't need his apologies.
Skura is a cheating whore.
What do you mean?
You're the woman of my life
Oh, my God!
I killed her!
Yanni couldn't sit still
Yanni doesn't seem to care
I've got the guys coming over.
Does Yanni go to school?
Who is Yanni seeing?
Yanni's phone was off the hook
Why am I even here?
Yanni needs Skura's support
Why am I getting Yanni's mail?
I'm learning Ido
Aren't I invited?
Yanni's behavior was odd
If I have time, I may do that
Are you mad with me?
How much is this watch worth?
Something's got in my eye
They say you've been ill

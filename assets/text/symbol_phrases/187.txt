I don't really need your help
I don't really need this
We're out of ammo
We're out of ammunition
We've run out of ammunition
We've run out of food
I guess I don't have a choice
Why don't we go together?
Would you hand me that?
Would you come with us?
Would Tom let me wear this?
Will Tom ever forgive me?
Why did Tom attack you?
Were you sad when Tom died?
Were you looking for Tom?
Is that what you really want?
Tom's time is very valuable
Tom's dreams have come true
Tom's car's parked over there
Tom's strength is returning
Tom's family is powerful
Tom's office door is open
Tom's funeral is on Monday
Tom's name is on the list
Tom's name isn't on the list
Tom's confidence is high
Tom's car's parked out front
Tom's parents are divorced
Tom's leg was badly burned
Tom's face is badly bruised
Tom's confidence is back
Did Tom's dog ever bite Mary?
How's Tom going to find Mary?
Tom is holding Mary's hand
Go help your brother!
That story doesn't make sense
What can be done about it?
Is this my seat or yours?
I will never, ever drink again
Are you here with anyone?
Are you here with anyone?
I'm here with my friend Mary.
Don't forget your costume
I'll never drink alcohol again
This isn't about Tom, is it?
Is that what Tom taught you?
How could Tom do this to us?
Does Tom live here with you?
Did Tom make this for you?
Did Tom leave a message?
Are you waiting for Tom?
Did you guys hook up?
Tom graduated in 2013
Why did you punch Tom?
What was your first cellphone?
Can I take my jacket off?
Can I take my shirt off?
Can I take my shirt off?
It's so hot in here
It's tedious
Don't grow up to be like me
Don't look so sad
It's a secret from Tom
It's kept secret from Tom
Let's go early
It's so teeny tiny!
He's outstanding in his field
They're speaking Irish
The sentence isn't useful
I can't keep up
She's talking way too fast
He's got good rhythm
I don't know what to say
I truly don't
He was a stone-cold killer
That's not a shame
When did you stop smoking?
I'm having a really great time
Above all, don't tell Tom
He was late, as always
I'm convinced he's innocent
I'm convinced he's not guilty
I'll try to say it in English
Did you see my mother?
Did you see my sister?
Did you see my brother?
Did you see my dog?
Did you see my cat?
Did you see my son?
Did you see my daughter?
Did you see my uncle?
Did you see my aunt?
What is Caoimhe doing?
What is Saoirse doing?
What is Oisín doing?
What is Ciarán doing?
What is Caoimhín doing?
Should I know her?
What is Mallaidh doing?
I've seen a flying saucer
I believe that's it
Please help me!
Can we order please?
The taste, not so much
I can't answer this question
Enjoy the life!
Don't be so pessimistic
You'll learn a lot here
That's my globe!
You shouldn't tease him
You can't have seen me
I'm tweeting on Twitter
We don't have much money
I shouldn't have believed Tom
I wish I hadn't believed Tom
Be gentle, but firm
Just how hungry are you?
At what time does it leave?
Will you be going?
Will they be moving to Boston?
Will the team be playing?
Blast it!
Blast!
Don't be so tense
Don't be so stressed out
It's very cold in this room
Well, from time to time
It's only a ten-minute walk
He has a fever of 102 degrees
Tom has Mary's address
Tom has Mary's car keys
Tom has Mary's support
I'm twenty three-years old
Because I'm a foreigner?
Is it because I'm a foreigner?
I haven't done that!
Have you got any apples?
Have you got any pencils?
Who had injured you?
Who had injured her?
Who had injured them?
I'm learning Esperanto
You're learning Esperanto
He's learning Esperanto
She's learning Esperanto
We're learning Esperanto
They're learning Esperanto
She wouldn't have noticed
What's the dealio?
You're a fast worker
I didn't know what it was
Plant trees!
You're not bad looking either
Where is the mother?
Julia doesn't see Emilia
Who's calling me?
Julia's calling you
Do you know where my key is?
What did he say to you?
What did she say to you?
Haven't you eaten yet?
You talk, I'll listen
Tom isn't a fast reader
You're talking about yourself
Talk about yourself, please
I'm from Germany
Nervous?
Me?
No!
Kisses!
Did you develop the film?
Start!
Wake up and be more attentive!
No, there is no such a thing
Have you ever been in Turkey?
I'm sorry for calling so late
Hello?
I'm older than he is
I don't understand your mind
I don't know your heart
Is she not doing well?
Are you guys all right?
Are you girls all right?
It's a fascinating read
I don't like him one bit
I don't like her one bit
You're not stupid at all
My love doesn't cost anything
You're not hungry
As you wished!
Well, it happens
Whose container is this?
What girl?
Does your coat have a collar?
The teacher's work is teaching
How much was the ticket?
Is that all you want to say?
Take out your notebooks!
How did you get caught?
These are Tom's ski boots
Hurry up, Tom, I'm freezing
It's too risky
You'll never be young again
I'll never be young again
Why did you marry him?
Did you bring the book?
Oops!
I forgot!
I'm from Italy
I'm from Austria
I'm from the Netherlands
I'm from Holland
I'm from Poland
I'm from Serbia
I'm from New Zealand
Have you got over the shock?
I'll get on to her right away
See what I did!
Do you have a Youtube channel?
I'm glad that you will come
He doesn't live far from here
How far are you from here?
Shall we rest a bit?
Tom plans to be here by 2:30
I still have Tom's umbrella
I don't even have a job
I don't have a job
I'll be over here doing my job
I'm quitting my job
I'm going to go buy some bread
I'm glad we're getting married
The door isn't locked
I've never been kidnapped
I'm getting pretty tired
Tom looks like he's bored
I'm starting to get bored
I have to admit I'm interested
I have to admit I'm intrigued
I don't like what Tom did
I don't like being cold
It's a complicated world
I don't want this to end
I've lost a very close friend
Tom's French isn't very good
It's a bad neighborhood
It's a tough choice
It's a difficult choice
I'm going to take your advice
It's a little late for coffee
I'm going to count to three
I'm just a housewife
I've already left a message
I'm feeling kind of strange
It's a risk I'll have to take
It's a risk we'll have to take
It's a private joke
Tom's French is terrible
I suppose it's not impossible
I've got to go out for a while
Tom, you've disappointed me
Tom isn't going to see me
I don't have it with me
I won't dance, so don't ask me
Tom isn't going to kill me
Tom isn't stronger than me
Tom still hasn't forgiven me
It's a surprise to me
Tom didn't even say hi to me
Tom just wouldn't listen to me
It's important to me
Tom said he'll look after me
You've done so much for me
Tom wouldn't even look at me
Tom isn't going to protect me
Tom was convinced, but not me
Tom was persuaded, but not me
Tom isn't going to shoot me
I've had a great time
I think I'm going to go home
I'll open some more wine
I don't like being all alone
I'm sure Tom will be here
Tom wasn't supposed to be here
I don't have a choice here
I think I know why you're here
I'm not supposed to leave here
I don't even know why I'm here
It's a little crowded in here
It's a bit crowded in here
It's a mess in here
It's a real mess in here
It's a little creepy in here
I've got a job to do here
I've got work to do here
I'll go see if Tom is here
It's a little spooky out here
I'm not usually here
Tom isn't really happy here
It's a mess down there
I don't see anything out there
Tom should've eaten more
I don't want to hear any more
I'd rather eat somewhere else
I'd rather eat something else
I think you'll lose
I'm afraid I have to refuse
It's a commonly-used technique
I'll come back after you leave
Tom's technique is impressive
You've lost perspective
I've got to say goodbye
I'm sure Tom will apologize
I'm enjoying myself
I'm having trouble breathing
Tom's family lost everything
I'd really rather go swimming
It's a little annoying
Tom's hair is long
I don't believe I was wrong
It's a perfect match
It's a minor glitch
Tom didn't try hard enough
I'm scared to death
It's a habit you can break
It's a hard habit to break
I've never driven a truck
I'm older than you think
I think it's time for a drink
Let's go get drunk
I don't mind hard work
I've always loved your work
It isn't worth the risk
I don't think this is real
Tom's blood pressure is normal
It's a little personal
I'm not going to go to a hotel
I've been expecting your call
It's a bad time to sell
Tom looked surprised, as well
Tom's hands are full
It's a really good school
I'm dropping out of school
I'm going to go to law school
I'm older than you think I am
I won't be going with them
Tom's wife has left him
Thank you very much, Tom
We've decided not to fire Tom
We've decided to hire Tom
I'm just here to say hi to Tom
I'm not going to wait for Tom
I'm going to go to my room
I'm trying as hard as I can
It's a simple plan
I know how difficult it's been
I know exactly what'll happen
I'm not able to have children
Tom won't hurt himself again
I'm not going to do this again
I won't be able to do it again
Tom looks like he's in pain
It's a tense situation
I'd like you to pay attention
I have a thirteen-year-old son
I'd really rather be in Boston
I've decided to move to Boston
Tom looks like he's having fun
I'm not going to have any fun
I'll do what I have to do
I'm not sure I know what to do
I'd really like to go
I'm sorry, but I have to go
We don't want Tom to go
Tom said he didn't want to go
I assume you don't want to go
I don't know why Tom didn't go
I don't like being lied to
I'm not a bartender
That's a very tempting offer
I'm here to see the manager
I'm looking for the manager
I can't watch this any longer
I don't like it either
I'm not happy about it either
Tom is a top-notch swimmer
I'll join you for dinner
I'll deal with that later
I'd like a bottle of water
It's a private matter
I'm definitely feeling better
I'm not going to get better
I'm glad this is all over
I know what you're looking for
That's a pretty color
I'd like you to do me a favor
I've come to ask you a favor
I'm not the person I was
I'm not one of your employees
Tom doesn't know all the rules
I'm not going to make excuses
I've found out a few things
I don't like the way Tom sings
We'll never know who he is
I don't know who it is
I don't think you did this
I'm tired of living like this
I don't like doing this
I don't think I can do this
I've been ordered to do this
I'm the one who has to do this
I'm just no good at this
I assume you don't want this
I'm really nervous about this
I'm not sure where to put this
I don't think I can fix this
I don't know how to fix this
It's a plausible diagnosis
I'll see you in my dreams
I'm afraid I have other plans
Tom has been up for 24 hours
I'm only here for a few hours
Tom shouldn't eat peanuts
I'd like you to ride with us
Tom isn't coming home with us
I don't think anyone saw us
I'm not used to this heat
I'll soon change that
It's a little like that
I'm choosing to ignore that
Tom shouldn't be doing that
I don't think we can risk that
It's a lot worse than that
I don't believe I can do that
I don't need to do that
It's a crime to do that
I've decided not to do that
I've asked you not to do that
It's a little late for that
I'd advise you to not eat that
I'd really rather not eat that
It's a well-known fact
That's a frightening prospect
I'm going to the supermarket
I don't believe we've ever met
Tom isn't dead yet
Tom isn't a millionaire yet
I'm not ready to go back yet
I'll see you tomorrow night
I'm afraid I was right
It's a nice thought
That's a frightening thought
That's a horrifying thought
I don't think you need it
I'm going to risk it
I don't know how you do it
I'll get used to it
I'll do my best to stop it
I'm going to fix it
I don't deserve all the credit
That's a definite improvement
I think it's time you went
I'm trying to make a point
I won't put you on the spot
We don't want Tom to get hurt
I don't know who we can trust
I'm going to help you out
I don't know what it was about
I'm sorry if I woke you
Tom isn't going to leave you
I'd like a word with you
I'd like to stay here with you
I'd rather stay here with you
Tom isn't going back with you
You can't go yet
I'd much rather stay with you
Tom wouldn't steal from you
I'd be delighted to join you
Tom, I need to talk to you
I'll listen to you
I'm not supposed to help you
I'll clean it up for you
Tom, I'm doing this for you
Tom must've left this for you
I'm going to kiss you
I'm still a little mad at you
I've heard so much about you
I've heard all about you
Tom isn't going to marry you
I think it's over now
I don't have a choice
It's a lot different now
If you lie to me, I'll know
Tom isn't here today
I can't be late today
I'm not going to do that today
I don't think we should stay
I'm sorry if I got in the way
Tom told me you'd stop by
I'm as surprised as anybody
I'm not in it for the money
Tom wouldn't harm a fly
I'm not from a rich family
It's a little bit funny
Tom looks like he's sleepy
Tom's not going to be happy
Tom looks like he's happy
Tom says he's never seen Mary
Tom said he's looking for Mary
I'm not sure this is necessary
It's a very long story
I'm moving across the country
I'm sure it'll be easy
I'll go see if Tom is busy
It's a rare opportunity
Tom wasn't at Mary's party
Tom, can I see you a sec?
Would you like some bread?
Is Tom left-handed?
Doesn't Tom always wear a tie?
What's Tom's real name?
How long will Tom be gone?
Does Tom know why you're here?
Why is Tom not here?
Why would he want to go there?
Why is Tom selling his house?
Why would you do such a thing?
Why is Tom studying French?
Would you like some tea, Tom?
Do you want anything, Tom?
Well, what's the problem, Tom?
Would you do me a favor, Tom?
Would you pass the peas, Tom?
Why are we lying to Tom?
Shouldn't we wait for Tom?
Don't you recognize that man?
Would you ask Tom to come in?
Have you found a solution?
Why did Tom go to Boston?
What else can I do to help?
How did you spend your summer?
How could you let Tom do this?
What's Tom's address?
Why did Tom give you that?
Did Tom borrow money from you?
Do I look like Tom to you?
What else can I get for you?
How do I know it's you?
You do trust me, don't you?
Was Tom at school today?
Would you like to know why?
Do you think Tom kissed Mary?
Do you think Tom saw Mary?
It's a table
It's a computer
It's a cellphone
It's a copybook
It's a pen
I don't have a nickname
Thanks for coming!
Eternal love doesn't exist
My name's Ricardo, and you?
That's my coat
Child, why are you crying?
I am suddenly in awe of you!
Where can I find a pizzeria?
Oh no!
You'll protect me, won't you?
What's for dinner tonight?
Mary, are you all right honey?
I'll stay longer next time
Welcome to our country!
We're too tired to study
Is there a bank around here?
What is your commission?
I'm not going to pass out
Mary, you have to trust me.
I don't trust you!
Would you give me a hand here?
It'll only take a minute
You're a rogue, Tom
You're a prankster, Tom
You're a mischief, Tom
What shall we do next?
There's been a gas leak
Not only that!
I'm willing to live for them.
I wish you the best!
I'm older than you
We're somewhat late
We're kind of late
Don't forget me!
May I borrow your telephone?
Have you studied abroad?
Don't eat like a pig!
Are you at the library?
This means war!
That isn't a knife
THIS is a knife!
It's rather cold
I am from Tokyo, Japan
Mornin', time to wake up
Mornin'!
I'm somewhat dizzy
The tickets cost 20 yen apiece
Never again!
Surely he'll phone me tonight
Don't leave us to our fate
He'll call me around six
I don't know what her name is
We're not getting dressed
How much is your commission?
Oh luck!
Where are your children?
Is your sister here?
I'll go to bed before 10 pm
How old is the oldest one?
Eat!
Food!
Does she have a family?
Does he have a family?
Is this his umbrella?
Is this her umbrella?
Is that her umbrella?
Is that his umbrella?
Is that your umbrella?
We can't solve this problem
At your service, my dear sir!
Ah!
I'd do anything to protect you
Have you been busy lately?
It's not easy to speak English
Do you like anchovies?
She's married to a foreigner
Welcome to Mars!
I'm using a computer
This is my opinion, not his
This is my opinion, not hers
No, you can't
I'll accompany you
I am glad to see you!
I'll remember you!
I'm sitting on a chair
How much did the tickets cost?
You have a great memory!
Why now?
I'm dying for a coke
I'm dying for a pizza
This town is pretty year-round
Who is responsible for this?
You must be an idiot!
Don't forget to breathe
Did you think about it?
My dear friend!
Where can I buy bricks?
Tom's loud and domineering
I've packed gambling in
Mary's packed her boyfriend in
May we smoke during the break?
May I leave early today?
Mary doesn't eat anymore
Did someone break your heart?
I think she'll succeed
Come on, Mary
How are you?
Good?
Bad?
Why is my friend an idiot?
Why is my buddy an idiot?
Is it like you remembered it?
My name's Ricardo
What's yours?
We don't have any sheep
Mary found a four-leaf clover
Don't say such stupid things!
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
Where do you not want to go?
Who is buying what?
To whose house are you going?
Whose child are you?
Which book do you want?
Who do you want to win?
When you're green, you grow
When you're ripe, you rot
Do you sell fruit?
Learn Toki Pona!
Why can't I love both of them?
Why can't I love them both?
What's the matter, Mary?
Tom isn't likely to win
I'd like to see Tom win
I hope Tom doesn't lose
Tom probably won't win
How's life been treating you?
I can't complain.
How have you been doing?
I can't complain.
It's okay, you can tell me
If you need me, call me
If you need me, call
Do I have to do it now?
Do you live with anyone?
Is he looking for something?
Is she looking for something?
I am anti-EU
What a terrific idea!
What a creative idea!
What a marvelous idea!
What a generous offer!
What a dreadful color!
What a lovely thought!
Have Tom meet us here at 2:30
It can't be that bad
I'm off to bed
I'm getting ready for bed
I'm all packed
We've been attacked
Now I'm scared
I'm getting bored
Now let's get started
It's OK to be afraid
Don't yell at my kid
The water's ice cold
Tom wasn't easy to find
It's an easy choice
It's now dark outside
I've known Tom since college
Now you're in trouble
It wasn't any trouble
I'm on parole
It's all quite simple
I'm glad you called me
It's not bugging me
Don't disrespect me
Now's not a good time
It's almost bedtime
I'm glad you asked me to come
I'm heading home
We're going back home
That's not mine
It's never been done
My shift's almost done
It's your only hope
It's good to be here
It's great to be here
It's a good thing I came here
It's too warm in here
It's nice and quiet in here
It's kind of chilly in here
It's too noisy in here
It's noisy in here
It's scary down here
It's right over here
It's strangely quiet here
It's very quiet here
It's all right here
It's freezing out here
It's like a war zone there
It's just over there
We've discussed this before
I've seen Tom do it before
I'm not teaching anymore
It can't get any worse
Maybe we're too late
It's almost too late
It's kind of private
It's been a long drive
Maybe you're in love
It's the right size
It's your night off
There's just one thing missing
It's only a painting
It's taking too long
It's where I belong
You're not tall enough
I don't have that kind of cash
It's nice to be back
It's great to be back
I'm so glad you're back
I swear I'll pay you back
It's solid as a rock
It's been a bad week
It's been a rough week
It's been a great week
It's been a crazy week
Here's your milk
Let's go for a drink
My life's an open book
Now let's get to work
It's not a bad deal
This thing isn't real
It's all quite normal
It's sort of personal
It's not fair at all
I don't like this at all
It wasn't funny at all
I've got this under control
I've already called Tom
I'd never do that to Tom
Don't leave this room
Don't let Tom into this room
It's not a bad plan
It's an excellent plan
I'd never hit a woman
I've never hit a woman
This seat isn't taken
It's easy to explain
It's worth the pain
Don't get on this train
It's time to move on
It'll be light soon
You're not a horrible person
Now I'm having fun
It's nearly dawn
I'm headed back into town
I'm all packed and ready to go
I'd better go
I can't let you go
My leg's still asleep
Come on, hurry it up
That's peculiar
It's been a long war
I'm hung over
My shift's over
My shift's almost over
I'm a private investigator
We've got a visitor
It'll be dark in an hour
Let's not discuss this
Don't try any tricks
It only weighs 3 kilograms
Look, it's hopeless
It's quite painless
Don't try to trick us
It's over between us
It's just the two of us
Maybe Tom can't hear us
Now I'm nervous
It's older than that
I can't afford to do that
I'm not quite finished yet
The movie hasn't started yet
The meeting hasn't started yet
The sun isn't up yet
It'll be cold tonight
Come on, let's see it
Come on, let's do it
Now I'm used to it
OK, I think I get it
OK, I think I got it
Come on, let's try it
It'll be a long wait
It's totally my fault
Tom isn't an adult
It's kind of important
It's your only shot
What's past is past
It's what I do best
That's an odd request
It's still dark out
We'll work this out
It's right above you
Maybe I'll call you
It's not fair to you
I'm not going to help you
Tom isn't as smart as you
Look, I'll show you
There's no choice now
I'm stronger now
Go ahead, try it now
It'll be different now
Let's start now
It's such a nice day
It's been a tiring day
It's been a stressful day
It's still my birthday
I wasn't born yesterday
It's easier this way
It's too late anyway
It's still not ready
I'm not giving you any money
It's still too early
Now I'm getting angry
Come on, let's hurry
It's useless to try
It's easy if you try
Maybe I'm just crazy
I'm feeling a little dizzy
Is Tom really doing OK?
Is Tom still on the job?
Are we almost finished?
Are we nearly finished?
Are you really married?
Why's the door locked?
Why wasn't I informed?
Do you ever get scared?
Have you already ordered?
Isn't that what I said?
Is it always this cold?
How did you burn your hand?
What changed Tom's mind?
Can I see you a second?
Is that a real diamond?
Did you order any food?
What smells so good?
Is everybody on board?
Do you think I'm weird?
Who called the police?
How was choir practice?
Is it windy outside?
Do you have any coffee?
What else did you see?
How's your love life?
How bad was the damage?
How long did this take?
What's it sound like?
What's it look like?
What's it smell like?
What's Tom really like?
Am I being unreasonable?
Do I look presentable?
Have you betrayed me?
Why did you choose me?
Have you heard of me?
Were you following me?

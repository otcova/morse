Do you still wrestle?
Do you still work out?
Do you still want to come?
Do you still want to see me?
Do you still work in Boston?
Didn't you know we were here?
Do you still want to go home?
I'd like to be here with Tom
I'll give Tom a call tonight
I'll go and ask Tom about it
I'll meet Tom in the library
I'm no longer married to Tom
I've never beaten Tom at chess
You'd better go and help Tom
I don't like talking with Tom
I talked to Tom and he's fine
Always do whatever's next
Did Atlantis really exist?
O native land!
She doesn't know any of us
Meow" means "woof" in cat
I'm not afraid of anybody
It's a good thing Tom is here
It's a pity Tom isn't here
It's possible Tom is lying
It's possible Tom was lying
Why's everybody looking at me?
Why's everyone staring at me?
Why's everybody staring at me?
Do you like jazz?
Did Tom look angry?
It's only 2:30
Did Tom look upset?
Do you like to swim?
Do you work for Tom?
Do you live near Tom?
Do you like tomatoes?
Did Tom look confused?
It's entirely up to Tom
Do you really do that?
Do you know why Tom lied?
It's hard to talk to Tom
Do you swim every day?
Do you see a garden?
Where are my trousers?
I've found the good wine
Looking for something?
How less what we may be!
Eugènie has large buttocks
It's time to get up, Tom
It's hard to say no
Do you plan to help us?
It's not big enough
Do you know what Tom does?
Do you live by yourself?
What time is Tom's curfew?
To have joy, one must share it
It's quite hot today
Do you tell Tom everything?
Do you really need help?
Do you tell Tom what to do?
That's not your knife
Do you think Tom can do it?
Do you like this job?
It's hard to work with Tom
Do you talk to Tom in French?
Do you really want to go?
That's what I love about Tom
Do you speak French, too?
Do you know Tom's wife's name?
Don't let it scare you
Do you often borrow Tom's car?
Do you like cheeseburgers?
I won't tell you where Tom is
Is that the real reason?
I'd be willing to lie for Tom
Do you need to leave today?
I'll tell Tom to contact Mary
It's only the beginning
Do you want to leave today?
Do I need to do that now?
Do you wish to do that now?
I didn't want to make Tom wait
Don't come home too late
I don't like talking about Tom
Do you like classical music?
I don't want Tom to be nervous
At first I didn't like it
Do you really expect to win?
At least it's not raining
Do you regret what happened?
Do you want me to call back?
It's urgent
Do you need to do that again?
I wouldn't do that without Tom
Doing that'll be very easy
That's a Greek word
I don't like riding bikes
I'm yawning from boredom
Would you like a soda?
You'd better wise up a bit now
The TV doesn't work anymore
I'm happy with my girlfriend
Noble be man, helpful and good
Is your banker honest?
Is your hobby time-consuming?
Is your tailor poor?
Is your dentist nearsighted?
Are your friends trustworthy?
Are your slippers worn?
That isn't practical
It isn't too far from here
It isn't too late to do that
That isn't what I have to do
That's not what I plan to do
That isn't what I plan to do
That isn't your knife
That isn't yours
That isn't a cat
Are your slippers warm?
Hey, look what I got
Tom doesn't seem tired
It isn't complicated
That isn't a fir tree
Tom doesn't seem very polite
That isn't big enough
Tom doesn't seem very strong
Here's a present for you
That isn't exactly right
This didn't cost anything
Don't worry
We'll find it
Here's a knife you can use
Here's a towel you can use
I don't like our new coach
Don't drink too much coffee
Here's the key to your room
Do you want to do that today?
Don't drink too much java
I'll go see Tom
It'll probably rain tomorrow
Do I need to be here tomorrow?
It seems summer's finally here
Nobody was here at 2:30
Please tell Tom that I'm sorry
Promise me that you'll do that
Promise me that you'll help us
Tell Tom it isn't urgent
Tell Tom it's not urgent
Tell Tom it isn't his fault
Tell Tom we aren't ready
Tell Tom that we're not ready
Tell Tom we're not ready
Tell Tom that we aren't ready
Tell Tom everything's fine
Tell Tom that I won't be there
Tell Tom that I'll be back
Tell Tom that I'll call back
Tell Tom I've a broken leg
Tell Tom I'm not ready
Tell Tom that I'm not ready
Tell Tom it wasn't my fault
Tell Tom that we'll be ready
Tell Tom that we're busy
Tell Tom that we're here
Tell Tom we're ready to leave
Tell Tom we aren't ready yet
Tell Tom that you're sick
Do you own any other property?
Do you play tennis very often?
Do you really hate doing that?
Do you think we're all stupid?
Do you think you'll stay long?
I usually don't make mistakes
I didn't know you could cook
The testimony wasn't credible
Where's your passport?
Hell, cancer is natural
One moment, please
Excuse us for a moment, please
Sami's daughter wore the hijab
Sami's daughter is so cute
Sami's dog is so ugly
Mary can defend herself, Tom
I can defend myself, Tom
My parents wouldn't understand
I'm not in college anymore
You've been so nice to me
I didn't look under the couch
When do you arrive in Paris?
That's my favorite song
That's a very famous song
Let's sing another song
Very shameful!
The statue's head is missing
That's a correct answer
Here's a photograph of Tom
Here's a photo of Tom
That's why I was nervous
Don't fish in this river
It's prohibited
How do you import settings?
I can't find that setting
It's already late
Otherwise, it means nothing
My goodness, how embarrassing
I'm bored
Let's do something fun
Let's do something fun!
I'm bored now
Let's do something else
I'm bored
Let's go shopping
Let's do something fun!
Let's go somewhere!
Why does no one say it?
Why didn't anyone say that?
I don't understand this part
Tom's dog hates cats
Tom doesn't like Mary's cats
Why don't dogs like cats?
Tell Tom I'm exhausted
Tell Tom I'm proud of him
Tell Tom I'll prune the trees
Tell Tom I'd like to help
Tell Tom that I'd like to help
That isn't what Tom meant
I'm sorry I lied to Tom
I'm sorry that I lied to Tom
Now I'm thinking of you
Mice don't like cheese
Fucking hell!
Sami's horse bit Layla
Sami's daughter was pregnant
This is the principal's office
Let's do that Monday afternoon
Let me see what you've written
Sami's backyard is a mess
Let's ask for something else
Could you peel these carrots?
You've lost a lot of weight
We'll be home all day today
Quitting smoking isn't easy
That wasn't easy for Tom to do
Let me see what you've made
I'm surprised Tom remembers us
I'm surprised Tom remembers me
I know it wasn't your fault
I'll never be as famous as Tom
Finding Tom won't be difficult
We'll help you look for it
Tom would've liked this movie
This job doesn't pay a lot
It'll be cold this evening
Perhaps you'd better call Tom
I've never asked Tom about it
I haven't called Tom back yet
We hope you don't do that
This didn't cost too much
These dishes aren't clean
Maybe Tom shouldn't eat that
We're going to surprise Tom
Tell me what you've heard
We'll talk to Tom on Monday
We'll do what Tom suggested
We'd better go and help Tom
We could've taken a taxi
Tom and Mary don't hate you
We aren't ready for this
Tell Tom to be here at 2:30
This wasn't so expensive
That shop closed in 2013
I've been in touch with Tom
Let's go get some coffee
Sami checked Layla's e-mails
I'm just asking questions
We'll help you tomorrow
We'd like to talk with Tom
We didn't go downstairs
Tom should've warned Mary
We aren't all like that
We aren't all Canadians
That wasn't an accident
Tell me when it's ready
Let's meet at my office
I'll talk to Tom on Monday
We're lucky to be here
I never would've hired Tom
We'll help you find it
We'll talk with Tom today
We still can't do that
That must be Tom's mother
Don't tell Tom I did that
Tell me why I can't go
Tell me why Tom can't go
We'll be back at 2:30
We won't wait for you
We'll tell Tom tomorrow
We aren't blaming you
We'll talk to Tom today
This isn't a fir tree
We'll talk to Tom later
This dish isn't clean
We'll help you find Tom
Let's get rid of that
It wasn't on the list
It wasn't an easy job
I'd like some pudding
Tom would've liked you
I'd like some pepper
We aren't like them
That isn't my knife
Don't get mad at Tom
We've misjudged Tom
Maybe we'll be back
We'll talk with Tom
I'd like some honey
Maybe you're wrong
Maybe I'll be back
We aren't cowards
We've adopted Tom
We'll help Tom
We could've died
Make up your mind already!
Didn't you see the fox go by?
How about you?
When is your birthday?
I didn't take your watch
I have friends, too
Has he finally arrived?
I'll eat my way out of this
It shouldn't be an issue
There shouldn’t be any issues
My husband doesn't like flying
Where are my hiking boots?
I can't find my bicycle
Where's my tie?
Where are my pants?
You're so gross
Here, for you, my little lady!
I don't drink tea nor coffee
Who told you I wasn't well?
Who told you I should do that?
Who switched off the light?
Where's your warehouse?
Where is your warehouse?
Where is the ticket counter?
Tom doesn't know he's adopted
Tom didn't want to kill anyone
Tom didn't want to hurt anyone
Tom didn't know Mary was sick
Tom didn't know Mary was lying
Why is Tom leaving school?
Tom didn't want to return home
Tom and I haven't finished yet
Tom does everything he's told
Tom didn't take off his shoes
Tom didn't want to play golf
Tom didn't light the candles
Tom didn't eat his dessert
Tom doesn't eat dessert
Tom didn't really mean that
I'll get the truth from Tom
Tom doesn't waste anything
Tom didn't want breakfast
Tom doesn't want us here
Tom doesn't intend to go
Tom hasn't yet resigned
I'd have no trouble doing that
Tom doesn't like sushi
Would you like second serving?
Tom doesn't eat apples
Which bus goes to Park Street?
I'll finish this work somehow
Why did you behave like that?
I'll find you a good lawyer
Tom and Mary aren't sure yet
Why was your train delayed?
Tom forgot Mary's birthday
How soon can you do that?
I didn't feel sleepy
Tom and Mary aren't home
Whose mistake is it?
Why did you resign?
Tom didn't love Mary
Welcome home, Tom
Do you often go to Tokyo?
Say hello to your aunt, please
How many pounds do you weigh?
Today is my husband's birthday
It's rather embarrassing
They're not your ideas anyway
The tomato isn't a vegetable
Should I call you a taxi?
He wasn't a good musician
I didn't need to hear that
Yesterday, I met a friend
Thank you for your gift!
It's their duty
There's a crazy world
Words can't do it justice
For the moment, I am very busy
I never should've said that
Good day!
Let's get in before it snows
Thank you, that'll be all
Don't you remember?
Only too well.
I'm used to eating sweets
I'm used to walking to work
I'm used to eating little
Who the fuck is this guy?
Who does this guy think he is?
Eugènie has a big ass
For her, I bought a clock
Socrates doesn't wear pants
When did he return to the US?
This plant isn't edible
I didn't mull it over for long
Don't tell anyone
I wasn't supposed to tell you
You're right
I'm scared
What kind of sorcery is this?
I think I'm a lucky guy
I think that I'm a lucky guy
Mom, please listen to me
What do we count on now?
Who's ringing at the door?
Tom drank a non-alcoholic beer
You're luckier than me
You can't outfox him
You are such a self-promoter
Oh, you!
Sami can't leave Layla
I don't want her to see me
I don't want him to see me
I didn't want it to see me
I don't want it to see me
That thing doesn't work
All that isn't so serious!
We're all going to die someday
I didn't sleep well that night
Whose side are you on, anyway?
Where do you buy your dresses?
What did you think I would do?
I'll be home in about an hour
Where do you keep your books?
They'll pay attention to you
I'm really not enjoying this
What are your working hours?
We're not like those people
We're both moving to Boston
I'll take you there someday
You're not crying, are you?
May I park my scooter here?
We'll have to be discreet
That isn't why I did this
You're doing fine so far
Why is this so important?
When are you going to go?
We've both read the note
You're missing the point, Tom
Why don't you like this?
Who else is on the team?
When did you get those?
Tom's parents live in Boston
When did you get these?
Tom and Mary didn't complain
Where did you wait for Tom?
How long will you wait?
Is Tom a relative of yours?
Who's there?
It's me, Tom.
What makes her so interesting?
What makes him so interesting?
A small lump of sugar, please
Sami doesn't date anymore
Sami isn't that into Layla
We care about you, Tom
I just don't have the time
I'm really enjoying this
I didn't hear anyone
I didn't hear anybody
Where's the food?
Mary wasn't sure how to reply
Tom wasn't sure how to reply
Mary, I am in love with you
Tom, I am in love with you
Tom isn't much of a violinist
Tom isn't much of a guitarist
I'm not sure why Tom did that
Tom can't tell us what to do
I've only spoken to Tom once
Tom might've told the truth
Tom isn't much of a pianist
You are too poetic!
So, how was this reception?
I'm drafting a plan
Tom ate a gluten-free pretzel
Tom caught Mary's attention
Do not twist or bend!
Tom can't go outside today
I'm not suggesting you do that
I'm one of Tom's teammates
Could you give me a lift home?
You're just as bad as Tom
Tom can't help me anymore
I'm not obligated to do that
Tom won't permit us to do that
I'm not all that happy
War isn't good
I'm so sorry for what I did
Tom's apartment is small
I'll be waiting over there
Tom could've followed us
I wasn't prepared for that
Could you make room for me?
I'd like to see the menu
They won't tell me anything
I won't tell anyone
Tom ordered a deep-dish pizza
Blackmail won't work on me
I've never heard that one
Why was he telling her this?
Why was she telling him this?
Why did Tom tell Mary that?
We'd rather eat indoors
It's too cold outside
I'm not married, either
I'm kind of sleepy, too
I'm kind of hungry, too
Is Tom studying French?
Is Tom going to Boston?
Don't splash me!
Mary's hair is naturally curly
Oh, a seashell!
Good day, my sweetheart!
Why are you still in bed?
Are you sick?
Like the grain, do the bread
Give me two ice creams, please
Today I'm working at home
Have you paid for your home?
Do you need milk and sugar?
I'm walking home
Say "hi" to Tom for me
When are you due?
I know Tom is self-conscious
I know Tom is good-looking
I know that's not ketchup
I know that that's not ketchup
We'll see you Monday
We'll see you on Monday
That's not ketchup
That isn't ketchup
Nobody thinks you're a coward
No one thinks you're a coward
No one knows you're my cousin
Nobody knows you're my cousin
The concert's been canceled
I'm sure that won't happen
How could I've forgotten that?
Everyone stood there, shocked
Everybody stood there, shocked
What type of person is Tom?
Do you think Tom is sad?
Do you think that Tom is sad?
Do you think that Tom is busy?
I'm kind of tired, too
Are you going with Tom?
I'm kind of angry, too
Where did you go, Tom?
What's Tom been up to?
When did you get that?
Tom, are you out here?
What were their names?
Tom could've heard us
Tom can't help us now
I'm kind of busy, too
Is Tom waiting for us?
I'll stay here until 2:30
You can depend on Tom's help
You must've stayed up late
My advice wasn't followed
I'm bored here
What a bargain!
Was Tom joking?
I need you, Tom
Is this important?
Tom can't dance
May I leave early?
It's not a smoking device
Are they selling their house?
I don't have enough money
I can't afford that
It's enough!
At first, French was a dialect
You're bang on
How does one become rich?
How do you become rich?
This sentence isn't clear
I'm working at feeling happy
I'm very late
What's a book?
Tom is someone you can't trust
Everything's great
How drunk were you?
Tom couldn't come
I've missed Boston
You're both losers
Tom laughed at Mary's accent
Do you know who won?
Let's make cupcakes
I hear Tom's voice
Is Tom your cousin?
Wasn't that amazing?
Who did that to you?
I can't open my eyes
When will Tom come?
You won't fool Tom
I thought you'd gone
I wish I'd done that
I'm not cold anymore
They're all gone now
Who's in first place?
Doing this isn't easy
Are you bringing Tom?
It's been a rough day
Do you have many scars?
Tom didn't look upset
I can't stay here long
I should've worn a tie
I've received your letter
Are you taking vitamins?
Aren't you afraid of me?
I let go of Tom's hand
Don't bother doing that
I didn't want any of it
I've had such bad luck
I've often heard Tom say that
How is the day going?
I'll brb
How is it going so far?
Tom isn't as strong as you
Tom knew he'd win
Tom knew that he'd win
Tom knew I'd be alone
Tom knew I'd be early
Tom knew I'd be late
Tom knows I'm competitive
Tom knows I'm divorced
Tom knows I'm homeless
Tom knows I'm homesick
Tom knows I'm married
Tom knows when I'm sad
Are you going to join me?
Don't talk to Tom again
I don't want any of this
Has Tom found a job yet?
Tom didn't come with me
Tom didn't win the race
Tom doesn't know it yet
Don't walk alone at night
Tom doesn't seem scared
Everyone, get out of here!
Have you made your choice?
How often are you in town?
Tom isn't talking to me
I'm not letting you leave
Don't disappoint me, Tom
It wasn't easy doing that
Maybe Tom isn't bluffing
Tom didn't find anything
Tom didn't intimidate me
Tom doesn't like singing
I could do that, I suppose
Tom doesn't like walking
It'd be foolish to do that
It's very crowded in there
How could I tell Tom that?
That wouldn't happen again
Are you calling me an idiot?
Maybe Tom wasn't bluffing
Aren't you going to join in?
Don't bother doing that now
Don't bother doing that yet
I didn't say you were lying
Tom has his mother's eyes
Let's stay for another hour
Does Tom know you did that?
This rope isn't long enough
I don't want Tom to see me
What happened the other day?
That's not your fault, Tom
Don't you have any questions?
I could go inside, I suppose
I didn't think you'd do that
Tom didn't enjoy the party
Tom doesn't seem so strong
Isn't it about time to leave?
Tom hasn't fed the dog yet
Perhaps I'll see you tonight
Can we get something to drink?
Did you still want to do that?
Do you have any books on jazz?
Don't bother doing that today
Did you and Tom get to talk?
I don't know many people here
Let's not talk about this now
Like I said, I didn't do that
Tom hasn't touched his food
That's what people always say
It's getting dark
We expect Tom tomorrow at 2:30
I gather you don't like Tom
You've gone too far this time
I've eaten the apple
This rope isn't strong enough
This isn't the right way
Where is my belt?
This isn't real black bread
Step 1: Be attractive
I think I'll change jobs
Give me a second, please
Tom's car was covered in moss
May I speak freely?
Tom is soft-spoken
I don't have any other options
Perhaps I'll see Tom tonight
I didn't know you were in here
Tom doesn't really like fish
I hadn't even considered that
I probably should've done that
I'm not going to let you leave
Tom hasn't met my family yet
Please don't ask me that again
You're not invited to my party
Tom still doesn't look happy
Are you and Tom still friends?
Hey, don't be so selfish, Tom
I didn't know Tom was a minor
Tom didn't have time to react
Tom didn't tell me about that
Tom doesn't want to go either
You won't be able to fool Tom
Tom didn't find anything wrong
Tom didn't have life insurance
Tom doesn't like being ignored
We'll get there in three hours
I've read your book
It's popular in Australia
We shouldn't lose courage
You've forgotten your change
I haven't kissed Mary yet
I'm still in love with Mary
Please don't walk on the grass
We'd better tell the others
It's going to be a challenge
Ha, as if you had a choice
I've never seen your father
You didn't know that, did you?
It's not a toy
Tom said he'd been betrayed
Tom said he wasn't finished
Tom said he wasn't afraid
Tom said he wasn't drunk
Tom said he wasn't free
Tom said he wasn't lucky
Tom said he wasn't poor
Tom said he wasn't ready
Tom said he wasn't rich
Tom said he wasn't sad
How old are you?
I'm thirty.
How old are you?
I'm thirty years old.
What's your name?
My name is Tom.
Tom doesn't like to take risks
It's getting dark
It's getting dark
Tom hasn't yet fed the dog
I'm getting used to doing that
It's not the worst yet
The snow's melted
Can someone give us a lift?
Can somebody give us a lift?
I promise you I won't do that
Everyone's still up
Everybody's still up
Everyone's still awake
Everybody's still awake
I'd rather help someone else
I'd rather help somebody else
Can anyone help us do this?
Can anybody help us do this?
Tom wasn't difficult to find
Don't leave, Tom
Do you like pork?
Has Tom left yet?
Let's buy this car
It's not compulsory
It's not contagious
It's really special
It's their decision
It's time consuming
It's very stressful
It's wonderful here
Tom isn't in a hurry
That's not required
Thank you, everybody
That's fairly common
That's something new
That's too dangerous
That's truly amazing
That's very exciting
That's very worrying
Tom didn't do his best
They'll never change
They're both weirdos
Don't make us do that
Don't make us do this
Did you see Tom do that?
It won't take us long
That'll help us a lot
That's wonderful news
Do you want some bacon?
I don't mind helping Tom
Teach us how it's done
Tom isn't doing his best
That's hardly original
Don't ask us to do that
Don't blame us for that
I don't like that color
I'd make a terrible spy
I've been here all week
I've never seen Tom drunk
Tom is the one who's dying
Tell us this isn't true
That's for us to decide
Tom doesn't cook on Mondays
Whose clothes are these?
Tom doesn't like spicy food
I don't mind helping you
I've lost a lot of weight
Tom isn't absent very often
I've read all those books
Don't ever lie to us again
Tom promised to pay me $300
I would've loved to meet Tom
We've just finished eating
Don't make us do that again
Please tell us what's wrong
There's nothing for us here
I've read all of those books
Most people wouldn't do that
Please don't make us do that
I've heard Tom say that before
I've joked with Tom about that
Tom doesn't like working alone
Could you give us a ride home?
I'm not the youngest guy here
I'm not the youngest one here
Tom must've gone fishing
I hear you're moving to Boston
I'll buy you whatever you want
I'm sure that's what'll happen
We don't need to do that today
We've just finished doing that
Could you use this?
I'm not the oldest person here
I'm very familiar with that
Tom doesn't want to hurt you
Tom must've gone fishing alone
That isn't something I can do
I don't have much money left
How will I know if I'm wrong?
How do I know if I'm wrong?
May I turn on the light?
May I turn on the lights?
How much does the watch cost?
There isn't any other method?
Are there any difficulties?
May I study Esperanto soon?
Nevertheless, Happy Easter!
Let us drink to friendship!
What are you going to watch?
I'll just be a minute
We're going to share
I'm sorry
Exactly 237 years
Who is your favorite pianist?
Not so loud, you idiot!
Don't snap at me!
Is that a hickey?
What's your nationality?
Polish.
You don't have to be so harsh
I'm glad that wasn't me
Don't tell him that!
Don't tell her that!
It wasn't just a fling
Yes!
Is that a crow or a raven?
If it's majestic, it's a raven
Let me help, too
Tom leaned on the window-sill
Were you fighting with Tom?
I can't eat all that by myself
The power's back
It's a blackout
Tom! what have you done?
Do you mind if I come over?
Remember, you promised
He's a rather handsome man
It can't get worse than this
I talked to Tom's mother
I wonder where he's off to
I wonder where he's off to now
I wonder where she's off to
Mary slapped Tom's hand away
Mary ironed Tom's shirts
Tom, we talked about this
Was I supposed to laugh?
Fine, I'll do it
Let's take it out for a spin
That's not my name
Do you like folk music?
Don't play with fire!
Why do people do bad things?
I'm going to mop this up
I'm completely crazy
With knowledge, doubt grows
Tom's car has air conditioning
Do you want to skip class?
Don't skip class
Can you come get me?
Don't procrastinate
It's no use playing dumb
I'm getting my cast off today
Your jeans aren't dry yet
Don't just stand there
Where vanished is thy love?
I admire Tom's work ethic
I don't know him from Adam
That's a real bummer
I just can't
He's probably just embarrassed
Why?
Why did she have to die?
Why?
Why did he have to die?
Why did she have to die?
Why did he have to die?
Tom, you need to stop
I can't find my jacket
What have you asked?
Why?
Because I slapped my boss.
What does IMHO mean?
I'm from Boston
Where are you from?
I'm from Chicago.
Mary's eyes twinkled
Can I tag along?
Can we tag along?
Mr. Jackson teaches music
Tom doesn't study much
Mr. Jackson is a music teacher
Tom doesn't want us to go
Tom doesn't need to apologize
Mr. Jackson teaches us music
Who is your favorite comedian?
Tom doesn't really seem happy
I'd like to get a dog
Tom doesn't want to cook today
What's your family like?
What's your favorite quote?
What's your favorite smell?
Where do you get your news?
Where do you want to retire?
Why do you like wearing hats?
It's true
Here, catch!
I don't care how it tastes
Won't Tom get suspicious?
I don't know this
It's true
Why don't you ask me?
Mary's brother found a pearl
Is Tom a student here?
I didn't shoot him
It's like some kind of magic
My heart's still pounding
A lot of girls don't like Tom
Lots of girls don't like Tom
I don't know many French songs
I'm here to talk with you
I'm afraid of tomorrow

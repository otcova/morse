How did you know Tom was here?
How did you know Tom was sick?
That's about it for today
Everything's about to change
That's not going to happen
Who knew about this?
She injured a co-worker
This is really wonderful!
I think you're telling lies
They're true
I'm violently sick
It's not quite normal
What makes the earth spin?
Could you go to the store?
I'd rather die than surrender!
Why do we have to go anywhere?
That's what I've been thinking
What did Tom do for you?
What did Tom write?
It's going to be great
Is Tom going to be OK?
That's not going to change
That isn't going to change
Have you become insane?
We're not going anywhere
The show's going to be great
There's going to be trouble
When can you leave?
Did you get the job?
Until Thursday!
How are we going to get home?
See you Thursday!
Oh, I'm a total idiot!
Is he planning on helping us?
Does he intend to help us?
How did you get my number?
How do you get this stuff?
How did you get in my house?
How did you get to be a cop?
I think you're stylish
Does Tom plan to help us?
Does Tom intend to help us?
Will Tom help us?
Let's go play football!
Did we make a difference?
It was updated in autum 2013
I hope you will profit it!
What were you going to say?
What were you going to do?
What will that prove?
What will they do to us?
What will you say?
What would make you say that?
What was it Tom said?
His name isn't boy
It's John
You're being too kind to me
Don't leave empty-handed
The tour's going great
There's going to be a wedding
Are you going to the meeting?
Do they know you're here?
Do they know what happened?
No, we'll never become humans!
Pretend nothing's going on
It'll be painless
It'll be risky
It'll be hard
It'll be dangerous
It'll get worse
Listen and I'll explain
I'll be with you in a minute
I'll be with you in a moment
What did you get this time?
What do we know about Tom?
What's going on at work?
Why is Tom sleeping?
Why is Tom late?
Why was Tom frightened?
When can we leave?
When can we start?
When can we get started?
What's Tom going to do for us?
What're we going to do?
Would you all relax?
I'll be done by 2:30
I'll be in Boston
I'll do it anyway
I'll get by
I'll get it for you
I'll get my tools
I'll get ready
I'll get the ladder
I'll go and get them
I'll go for a walk
I'll go get it for you
I'll go get my car
I'll go get the broom
I'll go in first
I'll go upstairs
I'll leave
I'll make it simple
I'll make you a deal
I'll make you a drink
I'll stop
I'll talk
I'll tell you all about it
Are these my socks or yours?
In short, he was wrong
I don't understand the problem
What day of the week is it?
Today, it no longer is secure
She gave a lift to a co-worker
Supper's getting cold
That's what Tom does best
This isn't about money
What did Tom decide?
What good's that going to do?
Where did it all begin?
Why did you do all this?
It wasn't all bad
How did you get my address?
Are you going to say anything?
Are you going to be there?
Can we get together for lunch?
Can you make it in time?
Did Tom say who did it?
Did you make coffee?
Give Tom the $300
How would you know about that?
After that, I get up
I don't like to make bets
Let's stay friends forever
You are not an idiot!
What makes you think that?
Where's he wandering about?
If you see, let me know
Do you believe in miracles?
You don't?
It's so nice
Don't worry
Mary thinks she's beautiful
Calm down!
Don't get nervous!
It isn't going to hurt
It's going to be fun
It's going to be hard
It's going to be fine
It's not at all typical
That could've gone better
That's all that mattered
That's all they wanted
The plane's going down
What's going on with you?
It's your fault, not mine
Where did you get that suit?
What do you think of this one?
Ah, that's life!
Give us a hand, will you?
Hold this for me, will you?
Have you known Tom long?
Have you made friends?
Don't get discouraged
Do you know who did this?
Do you know all these people?
Did you get anything?
Can we get closer?
Why is everything white?
Because of the snow.
How do they make snow globes?
Do wishes come true?
Tom's wish was granted
It's super simple!
Will Tom be joining us?
Tom's parents weren't home
There's a lot we don't know
That's really awesome
Do you have a boyfriend?
Why is that?
Did you have a bad experience?
What are you doing here?
You can't come in here!
What color are your eyes?
Jokes apart!
I'm really excited about this
The big secret's finally out
I passed, so I deserved it
Do you know her address?
I'm sure she loves me
He'll confess, sooner or later
I wasn't able to reenroll
What's that, buddy?
My father will retire at 60
Why did you make that deal?
What's Tom going to say?
What would you have said?
Why are we going this way?
Why didn't you make Tom stop?
Maybe you'll get that job
That's what we were told
That wouldn't be smart
It's not up for debate
What are we up against?
What're you up to tonight?
What's Tom up to nowadays?
It's not up for discussion
What's Tom up to these days?
Shut up and don't say a thing
Why is it upside down?
Who turned this upside down?
Who's going to notice?
What time is it in Boston?
Do you know what time it is?
What did Tom do time for?
Why was Tom in prison?
C-47 has landed
What time did Tom go to bed?
It's time for your medicine
It's time to get serious
What time did you start?
It's time for your shot
It's time for the truth
It's time we talked
Is there going to be trouble?
You can't park on this street
What kinda sorcery is this?
Why are you so suspicious?
Why are you so interested?
Why are you being so kind?
That wasn't so bad, was it?
It won't be that easy
What do you think of my idea?
What do you think of all this?
Why didn't I think of that?
What do you think this is?
How about some tea?
Why don't you have some wine?
Why don't we have some dinner?
There's somebody at the door
Has Tom done something wrong?
It's time to prepare dinner
Tom, I'm hungry
Tom, I'm hungry.
Me too.
He won't be missed
She won't be missed
I'm a slow learner
He just doesn't listen
Am I asking for too much?
No, I won't cook for you
Tom shook everybody's hands
Who did you say that to?
I'm pissed
Santa replied to Mary's letter
Is Greek hard to learn?
Is it hard to learn Greek?
Yes, getting pregnant.
It's an optical illusion
Is that true?
Yes!
Where's your school?
Fine, so what's the question?
Do you want to learn English?
Look between its legs.
I can't pass the test
Okay, who are you?
Can I turn on the radio?
Italy's country code is 39
He'll be busy until four
Kneel!
They won't let you go
Did you have something to say?
Tom will be busy until 2:30
Tom won't be here until 2:30
Did you say something?
Did you?
That's a little disrespectful
We're already 7 billion
What do you people do?
How can people do that?
Are you people nuts?
Are you people crazy?
Why are people here?
How did you people know?
Why are people clapping?
What are you people doing?
Why are all these people here?
Why don't we take a walk?
Is this going to take long?
It'll take three hours, tops
Send me some!
Do you like the plan?
What's taking Tom so long?
What took so long?
Who took this picture?
Who took these pictures?
Where's Tom's umbrella?
Where's Tom going to stay?
Where's Tom going to go?
Where's Tom going to be?
Where are you taking us?
Let's take it from the top
Can we get some coffee?
Love truth, but pardon error
You aren't an angel as well
What can be done?
In two days, I'll turn 13
You're just trying to scare us
Is it worth it or not?
We're following a narrow road
Do you have somewhere to stay?
Is there something in there?
Why would Tom take that risk?
The fine isn't very high
Never play on the roadway!
Where have you been?
She's been very busy this week
So-so, nothing special
A bitch is a bitch!
That's very motherly of you
Prices include shipping!
There's no life on the moon
I see you're wearing a new hat
They didn't change their minds
How can you say such nonsense?
Tom, your stomach is rumbling.
Yes, I know
I haven't eaten all day.
You poor man!
She's been very busy
She'd been very busy
Who's the boss in the house?
What makes people do that?
Are those people crazy?
Who took you to the prom?
Will you go out with me?
That's going to take a while
Did you take Tom's advice?
I'm learning Zulu
I'm a twelve-year-old girl
You think that I'm an idiot?
Do you enjoy living like that?
Together we can do it!
You're such a gossip
How much damage was done?
Mr. Bergerac, I'm your cousin
She doesn't love me anymore!
What?
It's you who she loves!
That's what's horrible!
What's that scratch again?
What's that scratch?
You..
I'm not that stupid, you know!
All of them!
Oh!
I have no illusions!
Oh!
I'm not deluding myself!
Hey!
I'm about to get angry!
I order you to shut up!
Come close, young heroes!
Sir, have you seen Sir Cyrano?
Oh!
Oh!
Let's practice foil fencing
Let's practice with the foil
I don't pay!
I'm a musketeer
Shut up!
Not in front of her!
Do you want to know more?
You've got this
Why didn't you just punch him?
I'm not bitter
Why did you take a cab?
Would you take it easy?
Did you take your pills?
Have you taken your pills?
Did you take your medicine?
Have you taken your medicine?
Everyone thinks we're a couple
Death doesn't choose anyone
Enough of vacation!
Where have they taken Tom?
Somebody's taken Tom's place
Someone's taken my umbrella
Don't touch this blue button
With these words, he went away
He's very brave at home
Where is this taken from?
What about a tour together?
Mary, come quick!
You're full of yourselves
Today's Monday, isn't it?
Tom just doesn't listen
Why didn't you just punch Tom?
I don't like gambling
Tom won't be missed
I'm a bad singer
What are your office hours?
I can't get you that dress
He's a little nuts
Ouch!
I've pricked myself!
I don't like cookies
At five o'clock we drink tea
May I use one of yours?
Someone's taken the umbrella
That's a wonderful forum
What happened?
You're dressed too warmly
I'll give it to you tomorrow
He's my biological father
Do you remember our dates?
Do you remember our meetings?
He's an expert kisser
Where's the fun in that?
You never treat me right!
It's so cold here
What kind of plants are these?
When did you plant this tree?
You'd better not plan on it
Let's presume you're right
My watch is gold-plated
You'll be plenty sorry
That's a pretty tune
You didn't like that game
I'm a fan of Britney Spears
It's the newest model there is
You'll be very sorry
Actually, I've never seen one
All right, I'll do it
Are they all nuts?

Are they going to fight?
Are they willing to leave?
Are we all going to die?

Come here, all of you
Could someone get the lights?

Everyone's going to be there
Everything's going to be great
Excuse me, but who are you?
Finding Tom won't be easy
Forget about it, OK?
Give us a minute, will you?
Give us a minute, would you?
Hang in there, folks
Has Tom gone, too?
Have you all gone mad?
Have you been in Boston long?

Here's what to do
Here's what we know

Here's what we're going to do
Hey, where did Tom go?

I couldn't take that chance
I don't have a middle name
I haven't seen Tom in weeks
I'll get there somehow
I'm in the middle of a meeting
Could I call you back later?
I've already seen one
I've been there myself
I've got a better one
If you wish, I'll ask
In time, you will understand
Is it all there?
Is it going to be bad?
Is it going to happen?
Is it time to eat?

Is my time up?
Is that about right?
Is that all clear?
Is that all it is?
Is that all it says?
Is that all it takes?
Is that all it would take?
Is that all of them?
Is that all there is?
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all you've got?
Is that going to be awkward?
Is that going to be OK?
Is that one of ours?
Is that so complicated?
Is that so strange?
Is that so surprising?
Is that so unreasonable?
Is that Tom's bedroom?
Is that what it takes?

Is Tom taking it easy?
Isn't it time for lunch?
Isn't that what you said?
It doesn't have to make sense
It isn't about that
It isn't at all clear
It must've been someone else
It was all Tom's idea
It was Tom's wish
It wasn't about money
It wasn't about that
It wasn't made of wood
It wasn't so difficult
It wasn't there before
It won't be possible
It would've been so easy
It wouldn't be fair
It wouldn't have mattered
It'll be done
It'll take about an hour
It'll take some time
It's a good one
It's a real good one
It's all been a waste
It's all been written
It's all for the best
It's all going to be all right
It's all going to be fine
It's all in the file
It's all in the report
It's all in the room
It's all in this file
It's all so different
It's all so hopeless
It's all so senseless
It's all that matters
It's all Tom can do not to cry
It's all we have
It's all work-related
It's all you can do for now
It's been getting worse
It's been going on for months
It's been in there for a week
It's been known to happen
It's been one of those days
It's been so long
It's been there a while
It's done all the time
It's getting darker
It's going to be amazing
It's going to be beautiful
It's going to be brutal
It's going to be close
It's going to be closed
It's going to be easy
It's going to be embarrassing
It's going to be good
It's going to be huge
It's going to be OK
It's going to be packed
It's going to be painful
It's going to be perfect
It's going to be tight
It's going to be weird
It's going to collapse
It's going to explode
It's going to get worse
It's going to take a while
It's going to take all day
It's going to take some time
It's got to be a mistake
It's in there somewhere
It's like one of those
It's not about money
It's not about that
It's not about them
It's not all bad
It's not all that great
It's not all that ridiculous
It's not going anywhere
It's not going to be long
It's not going to be that bad
It's not going to be that easy
It's not going to be the same
It's not going to happen
It's not going to take long
It's not going to work, is it?
It's not going to work
It's not going well, is it?
It's not so bad
It's not so cheap
It's not so easy
It's not so good
It's not so hard
It's not so little
It's not so unusual
It's not something you forget
It's not there anymore
It's not there now
It's not up to you
It's one of mine
It's one of our rules
It's out of my hands
It's out of our hands
It's right there on your desk
It's somebody else's turn
It's something I've considered
It's somewhere in this room
It's that time again
It's the other one
It's the same one
It's time for a change
It's time for action
It's time for cake
It's time for my break
It's time for pizza
It's time for you to go home
It's time to decide
It's time to get going
It's time to get ready
It's time to go now
It's time to have some fun
It's time to make a decision
It's time to make some changes
It's time to rest
It's time we had a talk
It's time we left
It's time you took my advice
It's totally up to you
It's up one floor
It's up to them now
It's up to us
It's up to you and me
It's up to you now
It's up to you, Tom
It's what I've got to do
It's you who are confused
Just get out of here, OK?
Just one moment, please
Just one more, please
Just take it easy, OK?
Let's get the other one
Let's get this started
Let's not fight, OK?
Let's take a chance
Let's talk about it later
Let's think of something to do
Let's get you to the hospital
Listen to me, all of you
Mary is my wife's middle name
Maybe I'll do that
Maybe I'll have to wait
Maybe we won't have to wait
Maybe we'll get lucky
Move over, will you?
My car's out back
My vision's getting worse
No one knows we're here
Nobody's going to die
Nobody's going to jail
Nothing's going to go wrong
Nothing's out of order
Now we'll have some fun
Now we're getting somewhere
Now what do we do?
Open this, will you?
Please take your seat, sir
Relax, will you?
Roll up your sleeve, please
Should we get a table?
Should we get started?
Should we go someplace?
Should you be out of bed?
Shouldn't we get our stuff?
Shouldn't we get started?

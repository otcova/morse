It's strangely comforting
The light was red!
What light?
I didn't see a light!
I noticed that, honey!
He's an Italian-speaker
You first!
I was a little kid.
In Paris?
Last year.
Do you think you're free?
She's happy about what you did
I like your smile, Hideki
Only four walls and a screen!
Once I'm home, I'll call him
Once I'm home, I'll call her
Come on, don't be so modest!
It's pure cynicism
It's tough raising a kid
It's hard to raise a child
It's so cold tonight!
Enjoy life!
Today, I picked up six eggs
I'm dancing with my wife
What a brillant idea..
Finish that sentence!
I guess my wife's pregnant
Good night, miss
Help him get down!
Help her get off!
Your mom's already there
You called your son "Tom
You know how to swim, I think?
He's been sick for a week
Do you want to come later ?
it's a difficult week
Tom?
What about you?
How come you're here?
What a bunch of morons!
You're interested in history?
He's currently at work
I'll no longer speak of her
I'm starting to like it!
I'm throwing in the towel!
Let's hope she arrives there
Let's hope she's successful
Why didn't you come?
He's listening to the news
He's in critical condition
She's in critical condition
My English isn't very good
You told me you didn't make it
I'll be right there
Do you think Tom was right?
Here's a list of what I need
Here's a list of things I need
It'll be as easy as pie
That was a bad joke.
It's been a real struggle
I know we’ll never forget
Mr. Jackson fired John
It isn't just anything
I'll give you that money
It's all a farce
It's all what you make of it
I won't make you come
Will you sing with me?
Would you stop that racket?
That's a valid criticism
I'm an Iraqi citizen
That's a valid excuse
How does water taste?
What does water taste like?
Does this water taste OK?
Does this milk smell OK?
Don't you live in a van?
Don't go to the post office
How did she die?
I'm ok with it
Don't talk to me about it
Ah, men!
Tom can't hold his alcohol
Mainly, Elias traveled alone
Tom's the name
Elias couldn't exactly leave
Elias didn't smile back
Instead, he glared at her
Elias didn't move at all
Elias couldn't get in on time
Soon, a security guard arrived
Who said this word about me?
What even is anything?
Elias has the killer's number
Elias's weapon was never used
Let's go somewhere lively
This shirt's too big for me
Do you have anything smaller?
What a strange little car!
He’s so rude
Are limericks always funny?
Tom is a half-elf bard
Tom's reply surprised everyone
Is anyone home?
We're waiting for a reply
Tom's reply was negative
No," Tom replied quietly
I wonder if he's OK
Tom's reply was prompt
What is the mystery flavour?
Tom is half-elven
Tom is a half-elf
Tom is half-orc
Tom is half-elf
What herbs did you use?
I can't sleep
What should I do?
Tom's got some day pot
Aṣerbek" is a violent blow
I've left my wallet at home
Who's that with the moustache?
Aren't you eating?
I'm not hungry.
Happy birthday, by the way
How could I forget!
I'm getting no answer
I'm not getting an answer
I don't get an answer
I'm getting no reply
I don't get a reply
I'm not getting a reply
What's going on here?
Oh, just the usual bickering.
We haven't had any news yet
It's a real shame
No one's forcing you to do it
My green jacket's gone walkies
What's this seat doing here?
Is her mother in there?
It's not a good sign
I'm trying to fix a leak
There's no way to fix this
This can't be repaired
It'll cost a lot to fix this
We're in a real fix
We'd better fix it soon
We need to fix what's wrong
Here, let me fix that for you
We're trying to fix it now
How can we fix this?
It's too late to fix that now
We're fixing to do that
That'll be easy to fix
That won't be easy to fix
What is the salt of the life?
I wasn't able to fix the leak
Don't worry
I'll fix that
Will this fix the problem?
Fix what's broken
Here, I'll fix that for you
There's no quick fix for that
How do we get out of this fix?
We've got to fix this
We'd better fix this soon
When do we get to the airport?
At last!
It'll be a difficult match
It'll be difficult to win
I think I've found a match
It'll be a very difficult game
I don't like matching quizzes
These signatures don't match
I really need a fix, man
Is this all Tom's?
I didn't order that
This prefab cabin is HQ?
I've always looked up to him
He returned empty-handed
How is this device used?
Even he's crying
I'm standing on a bridge
I'm standing on a table
I'm standing under a bridge
Damn!
Have you got any luggage?
Do you have any luggage?
That's a bread knife
That's a natural reaction
When will it be autumn?
That's a bad move
I'm sitting under a tree
Don't look that up
Elias's phone rang once again
We don't have any tickets left
Elias wasn't that concerned
Come out right now!
Who can blame Elias?
Elias's dog continued to growl
Elias wasn't as fast as Sandra
Luckily, the door was locked
Felix doesn't backpack
How did Felix set up his camp?
Can you find Boston on a map?
It's just a deer
It's been a difficult week
Felix's airway was obsturcted
This one doesn't belong to me
Felix's door only has one lock
Felix's home is very isolated
I don't agree with you on that
Sandra is femail and forty-two
I fell and Tom did, too
When was the baby born?
There's no rush to do that
Tell me: "where is this mercy?
I am in bed, dying
Why wasn't Felix replying?
Felix called out Sandra's name
Felix was on Sandra's porch
Wherever Yidir is, his dog is
Felix heard it, too
Felix heard that, too
Felix couldn't find anybody
Felix's apartment was so big
Felix's animals were acting up
Felix couldn't call 911
Felix's phone began ringing
Felix wasn't even drunk
Felix didn't know any Amelia
Esther has Crohn's disease
He's a self-hating Jew
He's a Jewish antisemite
Who will save Tom?
I take it all on myself!
Are you Russian?
No, I'm Slovakian.
It's not the same person
It's good to see you
I knew I'd see you again
I'm very sorry to see you go
Yay!
Let's finish the first season
They're looking at you
I can't do olives
I don't fuck with olives
I don't do olives
Olives aren't my thing
It isn't much of a job
It’s been drone dropped
Don't do anything drastic
Don't worry, darling
You're only 42.
Thanks!
Why would you lie about that?
Tom wouldn't learn French
Tom wouldn't study French
Are you the Tom Jackson?
We don't want to rush things
There's no hurry
I won't ever forget Tom
I'm not going to ask
I'm not going to ask Tom that
So good!
I'm telling mom
I'm heading east
What startled Tom?
Felix doesn' t really drink
The island wasn't that big
Felix's feet were bleeding
Felix had a two-cabin cruiser
Fishing isn't Felix's thing
Felix passed Amelia's boat
Felix didn't wave back
Felix didn't know who it was
I'm good at cards
I'm out of town
Felix isn't a hunter
I'm a soccer mom
Felix said he couldn't drive
Felix's house is by the beach
Felix didn't receive payment
Felix didn't look back
I'm ready for it
Let's write to Tom
I'm a model, too
I'm ending it now
Don't underestimate TikTok
I'm getting one
I'm in recovery
I'm done waiting
We're not immortal
She's lied about her age
What makes Algeria Algeria?
I'm a contractor
The lights didn't back on
Gunter took Amelia's place
Gunter's legs hurt so much
He's from a movie
Time to say goodbye, Gunter
Isn't Amelia beautiful?
She wasn't chasing him anymore
Gunter's skin was pale
In a wink, Gunter was gone
Where is everyone?
At church.
I'm in the woods
After all that's her field
I'm totally fine with that
I'm good at golf
It isn't over for Gunter
Gunter can't go on like this
Soon, Gunter will be dead
Today, I will treat myself
I'm too sleepy
I'm all fired up
I'm full already
I'm not going far
Have you had a rest?
Who ran the fastest of all?
I'm wiser now
Mary's gone out
The cake didn't rise
What about eggs?
Do we need any?
Sorry, I must go
I’ve got work to do
Let’s give Mum roses this year
Are any of your dogs missing?
A guard took Ziri’s gun
Why don't we make an omelette?
A woman caught Ziri’s eye
Aliens outnumbered Ziri’s army
At this moment, panick ensued
Enjoy your day, Gunter
I’m happy enough
I’m miserable
I’ll see you back at home
It’s just in Gunter’s head
I’m a bit tired
I think I’ll go to bed
One of Gunter’s men met Rima
Rima spoke in a man’s voice
That's exactly how I see it
Tears stung Gunter’s eyes
The alien broke Gunter’s hand
Are we ready to go?
The fear in Gunter’s eyes grew
The house’s power went out
This is Gunter’s hideout
This led to Gunter’s own death
We're all missing Tom
I'm not the worst
I'm not the judge
I'm serious, bro
I'm moving soon
I'm leaving home
Have you notified your family?
I'm certain I can do that
I'm a congressman
I'm having a kid
No; I'm a cat
I'm also a doctor
I'm an exception
Who is this clown?
I'm glad we came
I'm not popular
I'm a father, too
Words can't express how I feel
I'm rather happy
It's already over between us
No, none of them.
I don't want to live in Rome
Didn't Tom see you?
I'm a lumberjack
I'm ahead of you
He's as frail as a baby goat
I'm out right now
I'm imitating you
I'm not an orphan
It's not over yet, trust me
It's far from over, trust me
Tom will be there, trust me
This is important, trust me
It's very hard to trust people
I don't trust the media
I trust Tom won't let me down
I can't trust what Tom says
We don't trust our government
I've learned to trust Tom
How much should I trust Tom?
It's Tom I don't trust
Tom doesn't trust people
We can't trust what Tom says
Maybe Tom doesn't trust us
Tom thinks we don't trust him
I trust Tom won't let us down
We don't know who to trust now
Tom can't trust Mary anymore
You may trust Tom, but I don't
I don't trust polls
We can't trust Tom now
How far can Tom be trusted?
We can't trust anyone here
It's impossible to trust Tom
Tom can't trust anyone
I don't trust them at all
Look, you've got to trust me
I've gained Tom trust
I don't trust people like Tom
I didn't trust Tom at first
Tom doesn't trust you anymore
Don't trust anything Tom says
We shouldn't trust Tom
Should we really trust Tom?
How can I gain Tom trust?
Tom won't trust anybody else
Would you trust Tom?
Tom just doesn't trust you
I'm just a nurse
I'm not helping
I'm a victim, too
I'm not your ally
I can’t stay any longer
That's just what I said!
I'm not meddling
I'm not eating it
Seven is Tom's lucky number
I'm a black belt
I'm very envious
I'm not judging
I'm the chairman
What triggers regression?
I'm certain of it
I was tired, but not sleepy
I'm not your mama
Why is maths so hard?
You can't stay at home all day
I'm a watchmaker
Fantastic!
Do you still feel ill?
Are you still ill?
Don't ban books; ban fascists
I'm on it, boss
I'm also waiting for Tom
I'm a doctor, too
You haven't got enough money
You don't have enough money
Venus is always overcast.
Overcast.
I'm getting help
I'm Tom's advisor
We've been queuing for hours
Have you marked the tests?
I'm tidying up
Pasta!
I'm a storyteller
Tom!
Telephone!
Tom!
The phone's for you!
Name three pets you've had
Why is it such a mess here?
Why is there such a mess here?
Tom thinks he's really tough
I'm on my own now
I'm coming inside
I'm sure we have enough time
I'm blaming you
I'm the director
Tom sat at the table, eating
I'm happy we met
I'm not a doctor
I'm just a nurse
I'd like to slap Tom
I'm stuffed, too
I'm afraid, too
Tom won't eat this
I'm digging this
I'm a clumsy man
I'm planning to buy this car
I'm going to hit you
I'm thinking now
I'm smarter now
I'm not for hire
I'm going to get it
I'm sure Tom did that
I'm very ashamed
I'm an executive
I'm also a model
We're losing power
Tom fixed Mary's broken doll
We're not going to die here
I'm glad for you
I'm at the pool
I'm ending this
I'm here for now
The cops were at Gunter's door
I'm not in a club
Gunter will tell Amelia, too
Gunter wasn't expecting anyone
You're putting your toys away
Well done!
I'm pretty sure this is true
Gunter couldn't see his mom
It's already getting darker
It's pitch black outside now
Suddenly, everything went dark
Gunter was at Amelia's house
Gunter hasn't been drinking
Gunter's phone won't turn on
I'm in my nightie
Leave your boots at the door.
I'm a bit excited
Gunter came home, worried sick
Gunter's mouth fell open
Gunter's heart was racing
I'm the fastest
Gunter's garage was open
Gunter didn't even move
Gunter hid in Amelia's closet
Gunter's face was so pale
I'm relieved, too
I'm finally free
I'm on the ship
Google+ was an epic failure
Nobody liked Google+
I don't do any of those things
We're low on food
I'm excited now
Tom didn't score any points
I'm going on home
I'm pretty wasted
Does this need to be censored?
Is Gunter outside?
Gunter's veins turned to ice
I'm fairly sure this is true
Gunter wasn't calling back
Can you open up?
Can your wife say something?
Gunter's smile disappeared
Gunter's parents were away
Gunter's dogs went crazy
I'm heading down
Gunter accepted Amelia's offer
I'm in a meeting
He doesn't appear to be gay
Gunter isn't from around here
Open the door!
Can you let me in?
It's cold out here!
Are you sure you aren't gay?
I'm very woozy
Jonas began Rima’s exorcism
Jonas believes he’s not wanted
Jonas blocked Rima’s view
Jonas broke into Rima’s house
Jonas broke Rima’s nose
Jonas broke Rima’s teeth
I'm going to go wash up
Jonas came to Rima’s rescue
Jonas can’t confirm
Jonas can’t remember Rima
Jonas can’t shoot
Jonas carressed Rima’s head
Jonas caused Rima’s death
Jonas checked on Rima’s health
Jonas checked Rima’s itinerary
Jonas cleaned up Rima’s mess
Jonas crawled out, too
Jonas cut a vein in Rima’s arm
Jonas cut the manor’s power
I'm a geneticist
I'm sure we have enough money
What makes you think I'm gay?
I'm ignoring that
His family doesn't know
I'm sure we'll be there
I'm a stockbroker
I'm truly happy
I didn't decide to be gay
I'm gay
Or bisexual, perhaps
I'm sure we can do that
I'm all done here
I'm going to pay you tomorrow
I'm not doing it
I'm learning how to learn
Tom didn't smile back
No way!
That's definitely a lie！
I'm going to be back
He didn't sleep a wink
I'm on standby
I'm not on my own
Can you come this way, please?
Who’s this coming towards us?
I'm ready anytime
Which apples shall I get?
It's rather nice
We’d be better doing it now
Tom’s leaving the company
”Hi
We're ready for Tom
Are all of you ready?
We weren't ready for Tom
We aren't ready for Tom
Get ready and let's go
Tom knows we aren't ready
Tom knows Mary isn't ready
Tom knew Mary wasn't ready
Tom knew we weren't ready
We'll be ready for Tom
We're ready for action
Everything isn't ready yet
Everything's ready
We're ready for Tom now
But I'm really enjoying it
Tom wasn't ready to go home
Tom isn't sure Mary is ready
Can I go out and play now?
There's a green umbrella here
Has anyone lost theirs?
He's very entertaining
Mary, I think her name is
I'm on my way up
He's had enough of sharing
I'm a film critic
Tom isn't ready to hear that
Can I take a message?
We're going skiing at New Year
Tom say he's ready to help
We're getting ready for battle
Tom wasn't ready for marriage
We're about ready to do that
I'm about ready to give up
I'm almost ready to give up
Tom said Mary wasn't ready yet
That's all I know
Tom said he wasn't ready to go
We're getting ready for winter
I'm all you have
I'm ready to start a new life
I'm ready to party
I'm Tom's secretary
I'm here and ready to help
I'm feeling faint
I'm in a gang now
I'll think about that tomorrow
I'll ask him to pick you up
I'm very careful
I'm on sabbatical
Tom couldn't breathe there
I'm halfway there
I'm not epileptic
I'm dreading this
I'm already full
Was Tom aware of that?
I'm here to play
I'm a drummer, too
Today is Tom's day off
I'm not in prison
I'm on a mission
I'm not shouting
Shoemaker, not beyond the shoe
I'm no exception
Sorry, who are you, sir?
I'm very dizzy
Has Tom finished?
I'm still OK
I'm including you
I'm not your man
I'm sure you can do this
Exactly!
That's right!
We're under siege
I'm an art dealer
Tom stole Mary's idea
Let's take this path
It'll be faster
Let's take the express train
We'll get there earlier
I'm your master
Let's go by taxi
I'm running away
Let's make some changes
Don't say a single word!
Don't say one word!
We weren't defeated
Don't just stand there
I'm heading south
I'm not worthless
I'm loving this
I'm too nervous to do that
I'm upset, too
I'm staying, too
I'm hazy on that
I'm not a capitalist
I'm at fault, too
Tom wanted that, too
That's a famous tune
That's a famous song
If you pay me, I'l do it
I'm rarely late
I'm ready for a drink
I'd like a subway map, please
I'm the producer
I'll call you after dinner
I'll mail you the books
I'll mail you the book
I'll email you
I'll send you an email
Is it OK to eat moldy bread?
I'm an actor, too
I'm taking this
I'm leaving.
Have a good day.
I'm just scared
I'm trapped here
I'm really beat
And why should I do that?
I'm your leader
I'm dreading that
Does your roof leak?
Tom's air mattress has a leak
I'm never bored
What caused the leak?
We couldn't fix the leak
I'm cool with it
I'm not cool with that
I'm starting now
Jonas's fiancee is black
I'm not resisting
Jonas didn't even answer
Eventually, Jonas fell asleep
He didn't own that apartment
Jonas was very old-fashioned
The cop asked for Jonas's idea
Jonas's door had no lock
Jonas couldn't find his laptop
Jonas didn't have any words
Jonas sat up, rubbing his eyes
Jonas wasn't on the couch
Jonas didn't seem right
Jonas doesn't sleepwalk
Is Jonas going to move out?
It was Jonas's turn to go
The fridge wasn't turned on
Jonas's garage door was open
It's safe to come in
Let's take the express train
We'll get there sooner
Jonas didn't say anything else
I'm handling it
I'm making butter
I, too, am a doctor
I'm heading north
I'm attempting to do that now
I'm the champion
I'm a policewoman
I'm bored already
I'm keeping this
I'm trying here
Do you have her work number?
Jonas denied Rima’s claims
Jonas destroyed Rima’s armor
I'm multitasking
Jonas didn’t cough
Jonas didn’t dare to talk back
Jonas didn’t even flinch
Jonas didn’t find anything
Jonas didn’t follow the truck
Jonas didn’t know about this
Jonas didn’t need Rima
Jonas didn’t pay the ransom
Jonas didn’t return
Jonas didn’t wait for Rima
Jonas didn’t want to lose face
I'm lying sideways
Jonas discovered Rima’s body
Jonas discovered Rima’s plans
Jonas disfigured Rima’s doll
Jonas doesn’t smell anything
Jonas doesn’t want to die
Jonas erased Rima’s memories
Jonas fell next to Rima’s body
I'm exhausted
Jonas found Rima’s watch
I'm already drunk
I'm going alone
I'm a mother, too
Jonas has Rima’s doll
Jonas is, by now, long dead
Jonas isn’t afraid of the dark
Jonas isn’t angry at Rima
Jonas joined Rima’s tribe
Jonas knows Rima’s father
Jonas knows Rima’s location
Jonas knows Rima’s secret
Jonas learnt Rima’s name
I'm already dying
I'm a meat eater
I'm a rich person
Karl reached Colony 5
Karl resorted to Rima’s father
Karl returned to Rima’s motel
Karl ripped Rima’s head off
Karl said it wasn’t safe there
Karl saved Rima’s life
Karl saw Walid’s wife, Rima
Karl stopped aging at 40
Tom probably won't eat that
I'm not into you
I'm not psychic
I'm freaked out
I'm being set up
I'm not over Tom
I'm sure we have enough food
I'm the culprit
I'm rather tired
I'm still happy
I'm a lousy pilot
I'm finally done
I'm logging out
I'm paraphrasing
I'm in my house
I'm good at darts
I'm the adviser
I'm fine in here
I'm the editor
I'm a specialist
I'm a quick study
We're on the move
I'm ready to rock
I'm really stuck
I'm not into it
I'm deeply sorry
I'm done already
I'm not going in
I'm also worried
I'm troubled, too
I'm a neurologist
I'm at peace now
I'm not bigoted
I'm out on bail
I'm going to be good
I'm not into this
I'm really sore
What is it used for?
Who should read this book?
I'm sure we have enough water
Who is this book for?
I'm not thrilled
I'm happy that happened
We're investigating that now
You’ll see the signs
Are your ears full?
I'm a grandmother
I'm heading back
Sorry for infodumping.
Sorry for infodumping.
Why?
I love infodumping.
I'm a doctor as well
I'm not annoyed
It doesn't
Lebanon has a higher rate.
I'm going to go lock the door
Tom's behavior annoys me
Tom's rudeness annoyed me
It's a hopeless case
Can I extend my stay by a day?
That's your handbag
That's a nice jumper
I didn't have my purse with me
I'm going to ask Tom to leave
What's just happened in there?
How much does the trip cost?
I'd already seen that movie
I've shaved my legs
I'm not saying another word
Say night-night to Dad
I don't need anything more
I can't ask for anything more
He's a defector
Do we have any more potatoes?
Why are you learning Chinese?
Eggs, we need eggs!
Enjoy your stay in Berlin!
She's the apple of my eye
This is no-man's-land
I'm sorry, but I can't do this
I'm sorry, but I can't do it
I've hurt my shoulder
I've injured my shoulder
Are your shoes big enough?
Do you think I'm daft?
I'll make the beds
Can I rest now?
Can I have a rest now?
I've never felt more anger
I've never felt more lonely
We don't have any more wine
We don't have any more paper
We've asked for more details
How much more does Tom want?
Let's take one more picture
How can we be more effective?
I'm more than OK with that
I'm more comfortable now
Karl's shift started
Karl came into Amelia's room
Karl's heart was still racing
What does Karl do online?
Karl didn't order housekeeping
Karl started saying: "Money!
Money!
Karl didn't see any other cars
Karl wanted to cry, too
What brought Karl here?
Karl started calling 911
Karl didn't wake any of us up
Karl didn't make himself food
Why is Karl sitting out there?
Karl isn't there anymore
What does Karl do for fun?
Karl wasn't in there
Karl read Amelia's response
“Thank you very much!”
“The pleasure is all mine!”
Karl was John's boyhood friend
We can eat at 8
Come and see me at 2
I’ll have had my lunch by then
Don't worry
Karl tended to Rima’s wounds

Leon invaded Rima’s mind
Leon hijacked Rima’s mind
Leon isn’t around
Leon studied the alien’s body
Leon entered Rima’s mind again
Leon didn’t really like Rima
The others won’t be happy
The elevator didn’t work
Leon’s flashlight is broken
Leon said that wasn’t true
Leon said he didn’t need Rima
Leon sensed Rima’s hesitation
Leon hates Rima’s poor hygiene
Leon didn’t mean to hurt Rima
The android self-destructed
Have you prepared something?
Don't throw those books away
And remember, no peeping
He has not got much money!
He does not care for you!
How did we get here?
He who says A, must say B
He's in terrible pain
Leon was quite self-conscious
Leon wasn't proud of this
How can we stop this?
How can we stop this guy?
Suddenly, Leon changed
Leon ran over Amelia's foot
Leon's parents came running
Leon's bed faces the window
Leon has a medium-size dog
Leon's dog does bite
Leon wasn't aware of that man
Leon's bag was wide open
Leon didn't have as much time
Leon didn't report Amelia
Leon's TV was still on
Leon didn't say hello
Is Tom dead or alive?
Leon was an averge-size man
Leon didn't smile
Leon's phone had a password

Tom is a pre-eminent artist
He doesn't accept presents
He doesn't accept gifts
Is it over?
We're thirteen-year-old boys
It's foggy outside
Outside it's foggy
It's foggy out
Ask Tom where Mary is.
Do you think he knows?
Tom doesn't get pocket money
Best before: see lid
The cake's in the kitchen.
Not any more.
Where is it, then?
Tom rubbed his tummy, grinning
What does he want to be?
What does he want to become?
What is the equinox?
She didn't believe Mary
That's Kafkaesque
It's enough to know that
It's enough knowing that
Who will prepare the food?
And what is that for?
And what's that in aid of?

It's a tie
It's the rat race!
My stomach hurts.
How come?
Did you eat something strange?
No idea.
If you lie, I'll punish you
Will you shut up already?
Shut up already!
No.
We'll be next
I'm sorry
Huh?
I must've forgot it
Oh well.
No, no, I actually forgot it.
Ah, it's in my belly.
Here's your pen

Gay, furry, French speaker
Ring a bell?
Six foot seven, big glasses
His boyfriend's John

John's his husband
Don't call him my father!
How will Tom recognise me?
I won't submit to Tom
We're gay
I'm a fuckup
Shut up right now!
Shut your mouth right now!
I don't look forward to it
It's off the books
We're early risers
Tom might've seen Mary
He didn't find work
We've eaten there three times
Could I borrow one?
He's got every single one
It's enough that I want you
How stupid is the guy?
Do I smell?
Do I smell funny?

I didn't understand Tom's joke
Tom's voice began to tremble
Admit defeat, Tom
Wake up, Tom!

Nothing, I just coughed
That was all.
I'll email you the information
It's just a little drizzle
Was that today or yesterday?
I'm warning you, Tom
Stay outside!
You aren't Spaniards
It's all clear to me now!
What is this object called?
What's in your mouth?
Isn't this thesis convincing?
I don't want to do it anymore
We don't need these rules

How has this come to happen?
How has it come to this?
I'm sure they won't like it
I'm carrying plates

I took a 20-minute power nap
Royalty shouldn't exist
He's only just left
You'll find Tom over there
It's been warm recently
Where's your French textbook?

Do they know how old I am?
Um, who?
I just told you: Tom.
I've lost all my friends
Let me accompany you!
How does the knight move?
Tom's mind is in the gutter
This statement is slanderous!
This claim is libellous!
But this is libel!
It's not out of the question
What are the mods doing?
Will Tom pay for it?
The blooms are long-lasting
But not so fast!
“It’s work.”
Fantastic!
Who paid for these tickets?
Has Tom done it already?
Where is your home located?
What is that protrusion?
The bunny is so cute!
Who did you come to see, boy?
Tom doesn't care about us
Where do you want to put this?
Where do you want to put that?
Where do you want this to go?
Where do you want that to go?
It cannot be done one-handed
You're far from being finished
I shan't leave the house today
He's mad about football
Whose chair is this?
He's got the day off
He doesn't wear a ring
It's still missing a comma
Where's the newspaper?
On top of the fridge.
Has he made progress?
Has he made any progress?
We're responsible for you
I didn't obey Tom
It's a saddening trend
Tom wasn't paid for his work
Why am I so sick?
That's a nice-looking dog
Does Tom talk a lot?
I don't know how to park a car
I'm breathless
It's the best for me
Is it Stephanie?
Do you like curry?
Yanni came up to Skura's table
I've never heard Tom swear
Yanni didn't tell Skura that
I've never seen Tom with Mary
Does Tom gossip a lot?
That's a hornet, not a bee
How nervous were you?
Tom's whole world collapsed
He's a vegetarian
You'll find us
Blow harder!
I don't think Tom's the killer
Does Tom take criticism well?
I don't think so, my friend
You're coming today, right?
I'm glad I finally met you
Is there any doctor here?
Would you ever get a tattoo?
I liked Tom's ideas
I like Tom's house
You're my wife
I've never seen Tom hit anyone
I don't use complicated words
I've never hugged Tom
He's English
We're civil engineers
I have Tom's phone
We've been more skillful
Childbearing isn't easy
If I don't do that, Tom will
Tom's awfully sensitive
Which newspapers do you read?
Of course he's lying
That wasn't his beer
When is the equinox?
Here's a list of common fears
Where is your ID?
Tell them about your vacation!
Oh, enough of that
He won't be buying any bread
They'll do all they can
We'll set off after breakfast
The train's in
How long will it last?
How long will it last?
She's coming this evening
Tom gets up at nine o'clock
It's just round the corner
Was that recently?
Meanwhile, night had fallen
By now, night had fallen
The train's coming!
I can't say thank you enough
Yanni's head was never found
Yanni's body was naked
Where's the head?
Yanni's head was cut off
We're apprentices
I'm not a separatist
What did you eat?
Couscous.
Couscous?
It sound delicious.
But spiders aren't insects.
Whatever.
Will you study tonight?
Merry Mary, marry me
If you do that, we'll kill you
I've never heard Tom cuss
I like Tom's music
Tom age-regressed
Let's go, get up
It's already eleven
You're burning up
Love your comrades!
Love your parents!
Love your country!
Why don't we celebrate?
Let's go get Tom
Where is the woman going?
No one dares order me around!
Are you a fast runner?
Evil doesn't go unpunished
It's five past three
When I'm at home, I'm Tom
Hi!
What do you have in your sack?
Who's winning?
We're not keeping score.
He's at death's door
He won't live one day longer
Don't be afraid of the dog
It's not dangerous
Don't be afraid of the dog
He's not dangerous
You've all done well
We're diabetic
Don't overthink that
Why don't we risk it?
Is Tom a good skier?
I'll destroy Tom
Why don't we call Tom?
Oh my!
Crap!
Why don't we cooperate?
Please, pay closer attention
Tom couldn't run any faster
I'm a Buddhist
Why don't we all stand?
I'm not Tom's date
Tom can't see it
I'm worried about David
Why don't we eat now?
Why don't we turn the TV off?
Why don't we turn off the TV?
Tom's bound to complain
Tom's sure to complain
My flat's on the first floor
She's got long hair
Does the flat have a garage?
Does the house have a garden?
Will you let me say something?
Will you let me speak?
Will you let me get a word in?
It was a wafer-thin majority
It's still in use
That's small comfort
Happy Ramadan 2021
You're my son's mother-in-law.
Yanni's dental crown broke
Yanni can't eat on that tooth
Yanni doesn't eat anything
The first wasn't the best
Yanni's mother is Muslim
The first one wasn't the best
Hurry up!
We're waiting for you
Yanni read Skura's diary
Yanni doesn't have to fast
It's prayer time
You'd better go to the dentist
Yanni didn't pray at all
Yanni didn't fast at all
Yanni doesn't understand Islam
Where are you going?
Home.
And where's home?
Algiers.
There's a window on your left
Yanni wasn't working
Yanni hasn't left yet
Are you thirsty?
No.
Yanni wasn't that thirsty
Yanni wasn't that hungry
Yanni didn't eat
Why don't we wait until 2:30?
Why don't we ask if it's true?
Why don't we assume it's true?
Why don't we begin right away?
Why don't we bury the hatchet?
Why don't we change the rules?
Why don't we change the topic?
Why don't we cut the cake now?
Why don't we do it right away?
Yanni says he's hungry

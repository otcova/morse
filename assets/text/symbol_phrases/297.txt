Why do you need a chainsaw?
Why does Tom want a car?
Why don't you ever do that?
Why does Tom want a dog?
Both of my ex-wives hate me
Why don't they like Tom?
I can't do that for you now
I don't want to hurt myself
Where's your grandchild?
Where are your granddaughters?
Where are your grandparents?
He doesn't deserve insults
How about you take a break?
There's just no way
They won't be coming tomorrow
Listen up!
How do I turn the tips off?
He's talking gibberish again
Is this really what she wants?
Cover the flanks!
Round here, we make the law
Are you after me or the gypsy?
Where's your warrant?
His wife’s name is Liz
I'm used to working outside
It's going to get hot today
Let's forget about the past
This isn't very interesting
Thanks, Tom
Where's your search warrant?
Why did you need a chainsaw?
Why do you always wear blue?
Tom, of course, was late
Why do you still have these?
Why did Tom ask you that?

Why did Tom need a knife?
I haven't asked for anything
Does Tom have a black car?
I'm extremely busy right now
I won't ask Tom for money
I'm used to working outdoors
Let's talk about it tomorrow
Tom didn't help us at all
We can't risk that happening
Tom didn't look a bit sad
We don't need three bicycles
Tom doesn't drive to work
Tom doesn't know how rich I am
We've never tried doing that
Tom doesn't pay us enough
Why do you care what happens?
Both of my parents can't swim
I can't do that for you today
Tom isn't having much fun
I don't have my own apartment
I don't think that's so funny
They didn't accept my apology
Tom's brother is a doctor
What did you put into the box?
Tom's brother is a lawyer
Tom's condition got worse
Why are you always doing that?
Tom, look at what you did
Why do you wear blue so often?
We've decided to help Tom
I can't accept your invitation
Why did Tom ask Mary that?
I didn't need to come so early
Why did Tom need a hammer?
I didn't want to cause trouble
Why does Tom call me that?
You could've just told Tom
Tom wasn't feeling very hungry
I loved Yidir's proposal
How are your dog's teeth?
I can't post the raw footage
What is dark energy?
What is dark matter?
Have you ever been in Rio?
How large is the universe?
You're hypersensitive

I don't feel like playing golf
It's boiling today
I'm not afraid of huge spiders
Don't worry
Is that asking too much?
I use Windows 7 in my PC
I'm about to cum
Wanna watch Netflix and chill?
In which way did it develop?
She didn't know the right word
It's the greatest of miseries
Have you come back already?
Where were you for so long?
It's going to get cold tonight
I won't have to go there alone
Why does Tom want to quit?
Why does Tom want my help?
I don't speak French or German
Why does Tom want a horse?
I don't like being called that
Come, let us make bricks!
This code can't be cracked
They're bleeding
She's in the basement
She's not his wife
She's his daughter
I'm old now
It's broken
Are you happy now?
Where's your dog?
It's dead
Are you happy now?
I feel like I'm in a furnace
I just hope she's OK
I just hope he's OK
Do you have money ?
F*uk you
F*uk it
F*uk off
I don't care
That's all he ever talks about
When do you graduate?
Is he really into me?
Is he into me?
Is she into me?
Why is he talking to me?
Why is she talking to me?
Maybe he's just being polite
Maybe she's just being polite
We don't know who we can trust
We're extremely busy right now
Tom's face lit up
Mary's face lit up
I didn't use to do this
I've never smoked in my life
I'm now used to not smoking
I'm used to doing this
Is not all this obvious?
I don’t think you can help me
Tom's injury isn't serious
Yes, I knew him well
Did you know Tom at that time?
I know it’s all wrong
“Yes, I am doing so.”
“Dear me!
Dear me!” he said at last
Tom's injury seems serious
Why does Tom feel that way?
Why does Tom need a hammer?
Why does Tom want all that?
Why does Tom want all this?
She doesn't care at all
She can't remember
Is this a shitpost?
Tom is a well-known shitposter

Repent!
What's your ascendant?
What's your rising sign?
What's your Moon sign?
If I were you, I would walk
It's raining cats and dogs!
It's snowing galore!
Tom doesn't call me anymore
I don't know any of them
I'm sorry, Tom
I don't feel sad
I don't like music
I don't sleep well
I don't feel guilty
I don't mince words

This isn't a poisonous snake
This snake isn't poisonous
This letter hasn't been signed
That fish isn't edible
That room isn't very large
That problem isn't avoidable
That water isn't safe to drink
The flower isn't black

Come on, guys
This isn't funny anymore
Fuji isn't as tall as Mt
Life isn't fair
Your idea isn't entirely crazy
Skydiving isn't my idea of fun
Learning a language isn't easy
Being a prince isn't that easy
What they told you isn't true
This, however, isn't possible
Smoking on duty isn't allowed
Smoking isn't a healthy habit
Most work isn't very pleasant
I only hope it isn't too late
Clearly, the rumor isn't true
Your approval isn't required
What you want isn't possible
Spring fever isn't a disease
Smoking isn't permitted here
School isn't a waste of time
Life isn't all fun and games
For me, this isn't a problem
All that glitters isn't gold
Now isn't the time to panic
Life isn't meant to be easy
Climate change isn't a hoax
Today isn't your lucky day
Our new car isn't very big
Fashion isn't my specialty
Bigger isn't always better
Pink isn't just for girls
Being a prince isn't easy
More isn't always better
Jazz isn't my speciality
Yours isn't bad, either
Today isn't good for me
Safety isn't guaranteed
Retreat isn't an option
Jazz isn't my specialty
Europe isn't a country
Alcoholism isn't funny
Africa isn't a country
Tom wasn't exactly impressed
Tom wasn't apologetic
Tom and Mary weren't famous
Tom and I aren't a couple
Tom hasn't yet arrived
Tom wouldn't relent
We shouldn't have angered Tom
Everything's fine
That isn't Tom's
That isn't for Tom
That isn't Tom's fault
That isn't all Tom said
That isn't what Tom did
That isn't what Tom does
That isn't what Tom said
That isn't what Tom says
That isn't why Tom did it
That isn't how Tom sees it
That isn't my problem, Tom
That isn't what I told Tom
That isn't your fault, Tom
That isn't Tom
That's John
That isn't what Tom told me
That isn't what Tom told us
That isn't why Tom did that
That isn't why Tom resigned
That isn't what Tom is asking
That isn't why Tom didn't win
That isn't good enough for Tom
You aren't Tom's type
You aren't alone, Tom
You aren't Tom, are you?
You aren't helping, Tom
You aren't that old, Tom
You aren't as young as Tom
You aren't scaring me, Tom
You aren't too old for Tom
You aren't anything like Tom
You aren't going to find Tom
You aren't alone anymore, Tom
You aren't going to catch Tom
You aren't fooling anyone, Tom
You aren't in any trouble, Tom
You aren't fooling anyone, Tom
We know it's you
It isn't likely Tom went there
Tom didn't mince his words
You don't usually lie
You don't usually lie
Why are you lying now?
Tom isn't a saint
Tom isn't in his bed
Tom isn't in his car

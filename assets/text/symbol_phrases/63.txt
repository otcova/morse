Tom was late, as usual
I think that we're next
I think that it's nice, too
We had no time!
We didn't have any time!
It was a joke, of course
What leads to success?
He's up for everything
He's stuck in Algiers
I do not love her.
Liar!
May I continue?
By all means.
Do you still like couscous?
Who is right?
You are hungry again?
He's my youngest sibling
She's my youngest sibling
Tom is a typical 'Murican
The exact year is 1742
Today I'm inspired to write
All for one, one for all!
Do you have a football?
Do you live with your family?
Do you play in a team?
Do you like to play cards?
Have you ever hitchhiked?
I've found out where Tom works
I don't have three brothers
I don't have three sisters
I don't live far from Boston
I was born in 2013 in Boston
I can't read this size font
I've found a new roommate
I've gained thirty pounds
I got a bone-marrow transplant
He didn't see it
She didn't see it
We didn't see it
I'm waiting for Skura
He's waiting for Skura
She's waiting for Skura
We're waiting for Skura
They're waiting for Skura
We're living our dream
They're living their dream

They didn't expect this
They're making progress
I'm not watching TV now

Where did you get this book?
Where should I drop you off?
Tom didn't even explain why
Who gave these books to you?
Tom hasn't apologized to me
Why did you do such a thing?
Tom hasn't apologized to us
Did you get drunk last night?
Who gave you these books?
I think that it's working
I think that I'll go now
I think that you're nice
I think that you're beautiful
I think that it's very nice
This is impossible!
Possible.
Don't be lazy and go with us
Don't marry that man
Who is the man?
Do you know him?
That's a major problem
I don't like cookies, either
I don't eat cookies very often
How many cookies did you buy?
Do you think that I'm right?
I think that that's better
I think that that's best
Do you think that it works?
Do you think that that's bad?
I think that we're all right
I think that I'll wait here
I think that it's time I left
How can Tom help us?
Once a year, Apollo laughs
What wine would you recommend?
No one knows what'll happen
Nobody knows what'll happen
I'm ashamed to be a woman
He's sending mixed messages
Fine.
I came to see my girlfriend.
Your girlfriend?
Arguing isn't gonna help
Fighting isn't gonna help
They're fighting over Skura
Doing that isn't going to help
How many men have you kissed?
You're a terrible director
You're a terrible teacher
You're a terrible father
You're a terrible mother
You're a terrible babysitter
You're a terrible musician
You're a terrible artist
She's pretty and smart
Who's gonna play Romeo?
You're a terrible mother.
You take that back!
You're a terrible wife.
They say she's a slut.
This is just trash talk.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.
He's not limping at all
Wikipedia says he's dead
He's of Algerian descent
I don't want to dwell on it
He's such a good friend
Can I come to the ceremony?
May I attend the ceremony?
She's a serious student
I don't want him to be my boss
They're incorrigible
I shouldn't've lied
We shouldn't've come
I shouldn't've asked
You shouldn't've run
I shouldn't've called
You shouldn't've come
I shouldn't've done it
I shouldn't've taken it
I shouldn't've told you
I shouldn't've eaten that
We shouldn't've given up
I didn't hear the door opening
I don't really like this beach
You've really changed a lot
Could you show me how?
I don't really like this place
He's making a musical
He's a director
He's making a Broadway musical
The director won't see you
He's going to that audition
We're on the same wavelength
I'm expecting Tom to be there
Don't say a word, baby
Let's roll up our sleeves
I'll get the door for you
Where does the time go?
He's doing drugs
Where has he been all day?
I'm gonna make lemonade
He'll need a crowbar
I'm drawn to ladies like you
She's a soap opera actress
I'd like to come to your party
You're Algerian now

Whose jacket are you wearing?
That seat wasn't taken
He thinks she's a drag queen
I don't have an Adam's apple
I'm Muslim and I never hook up
He's a lefty
He's very good at reading lips
I lost twenty pound.
I turned the scale back.
She's a gorgeous brunette
Gather around, people
What did he say on the phone?
He's writing a book about you
He's always by your side
He's allergic to sugar
She's baking cookies for you
I think that we're safe here
I didn't think that you'd come
I think that we're too young
I think that isn't true
I think that that isn't true
I think that that's not true
I think that you'd agree
I think that you'll approve
I think that it's a good idea
I think that most of it's true
I shouldn't have sold my house
I've looked for a weapon
I'm looking for a weapon
I'm going to look for a weapon
I'll look for a weapon
I'll be looking for a weapon
I'd looked for a weapon
Do you see my hand?
Sometimes, I want to die
Weren't you at home yesterday?
Health and a long life!
Drink to my health!
Quick, hide in here!
Quick, hide over here!
I think that that's inaccurate

Tom is one Mary's three kids
Tom is Mary's competitor
Tom won't be able to help me
Tom won't able to fool Mary

A car hit one of Tom's dogs
A jury will decide Tom's fate
Tom's father beat him
Tom's mother scolded him
Tom's family supports him
Will religion ever disappear?
This song is a crowd-pleaser
He's Tom
Tom from Boston.
The lady doesn't smoke
I haven't written anything yet
I'm enjoying the party
I'm trying not to panic
Tom is mistaken, of course
I'm unsure how to react
Tom is a soldier's soldier
I'm completely worn out
I'd be thrilled to do that
Tom isn't able to help Mary
I'm very hungry this morning
Tom is busy and I am, too
Tom is very busy and I am, too
I'm feeling adventurous
I'm too busy to help you
I'm too busy to help you today
I'm sure you'll like that
I'm sure that you'll like that
I'm sure you won't like that
Tom is sure you'll like Mary
The news didn't trouble Tom
Tom's parents grounded him
Tom's parents abandoned him
The news didn't surprise Tom
Tom's girlfriend dumped him
Tom's own father killed him
That's going to fascinate Tom
I'm fascinated by that
Tom's father scolded him
Tom's father will scold him

Tom isn't working this weekend
Tom is Mary's dance partner
Tom isn't seriously injured
I'm unsure how to proceed
I'm tired and discouraged
Tom won't give me that
Tom isn't aware of the danger
I'm by no means satisfied
I'm tired, but not sleepy
Tom is a plain, ordinary kid
Tom isn't ready do that

I could tell Tom wasn't joking
I'm almost sure that's correct
I'll do anything that I can do
I'll do anything I can do
I wonder who'd want to do that
I wasn't able to lift that box
We didn't want to go to Boston
I'm the one who chose the wine
I'd like to become your wife
Do you have any golf balls?
Do you play on a team?
Are you on a team?
This isn't what I needed
We'll wait for Tom here
What do they have in common?
What will I do there?
Don't look at Tom, look at me
I don't like work
Are you a member?
This is so beautiful!

I'd be willing to try it again
We're not ready to do that yet
We aren't ready to do that yet
Do you think that I'm fat?
We don't have to complain!
He didn't even know that
When will the match start?
Who is she dancing with?
She'll never get married
Don't eat the couscous
How could I not become Muslim?
Should I become Muslim?
Should I convert to Islam?
Are your parents Muslim?
Don't cry!
You call me an Impostor!
And why?
That's why I am here
I'm going to do that anyway
I'm afraid to do that alone
Tom is where Mary said he'd be
Tom is at the party, isn't he?
Tom is your teacher, isn't he?
Tom is disappointed, isn't he?
Tom can't open the door
I'm more than happy to help

We're too far away to hear Tom
I'm too tired to keep working
I'm too scared to do anything
Tom can't open the window
I'm beginning to feel left out
I'm ready for the exam
But where is my imposture?
I'm eating an onion
Why are you doing this, Tom?
Why?
Are those your pupils?
Goodness me!
What a beautiful arse!
Goodness me!
Goodness gracious!
That's one reason why I'm here
How old do you think he is?
I haven't seen his place
I didn't like her either
We don't need his approval
I'm almost hoping I'm wrong
What happened with Skura?
His mother isn't feeling good
He's impossible to pin down
Does this bother you?
Don't look now
Remember, always be sweet

I'm sorry I got carried away
He's gonna die soon
How do I look?
Like an idiot.
He's bringing his show back

Oh, well
Tom is here now, isn't he?
His name wasn't mentioned
Where's my breakfast?
You're sitting on it.
Why did you make that call?
I'm not the maid
I'm his wife
Don't worry
You'll get a fair trial
She's a good maid
She's a good cook
Have you ever won a trophy?
He's speaking in a silly voice

Do you live in the big city?
I'm learning Armenian
Did Tom agree with you?
Does Tom agree with you?
Why didn't Tom agree with you?
Where is your French textbook?

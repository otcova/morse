Tom says I'm stingy
Tom says I'm a bum
I'm Tom's mentor
I didn't wait
I didn't quit
I can't hurt Tom
I didn't pass
I'm Tom's rival
I didn't fall
I'm Tom's guest
I can't paint
I like Tom, too
I gave Tom $300
I've escaped
I've done OK
I'm well off
I'm watching
I'm unafraid
I'm troubled
I'm too weak
I'm too thin
I'm too slow
I'm too late
Tom said he'd wait and see
I can't wait to do that again
How can life get any better?
How can people be so stupid?
I don't feel like singing now
How could I have known that?
Get that thing away from me!
It’s getting dark
Fine, thanks!
Welcome, dear guests!
Tom threw a pie in Mary's face
Why do you guys always fight?
Are you easily frustrated?
Who threw a pie at Tom?
I don't want to study tonight
How could this happen to us?
How did that thing get here?
I hope they're going to be OK
How did the police find out?
I hope you'll come back again
How did the rain affect you?
How did you all decide that?
How did you do that so fast?
Tom will do that, I'm sure
How did you feel about that?

I'd rather not sing right now
How do we proceed from here?
How did Tom get you to sing?
I'll find some way to do that
How do you cope with stress?
How did Tom know what to do?
I'll find some way to do this
How do you know that's true?

I'm going to practice driving

I'm sure they're all gone now

How exactly did you do that?
I didn't give Tom any money
I don't like to think about it
How far away is the library?
I didn't see Tom doing that
How hot is it where you are?
Tom must've been a good person
Why is no one here?
How is that going to happen?
I don't think Tom will swim
I haven't forgotten any of you
How long have you been home?
I hope I'll be able to do that
How many coins did you find?
How many knives do you need?
I never count on Tom's help
How much is this coin worth?
I'll never be as good as them
I don't wanna go to work
I really don't know what to do
How much is your life worth?
I'm glad Tom is on our team
I think it's a massive problem
Tom never should've been fired
I think we've got enough money
How on earth can we do that?
How should we be doing this?
How tough is that to handle?
How well do you know Boston?
Tom couldn't close the door
I'd like to do a lot of things
How are earthquakes measured?
I'm willing to do that for you
How can I be a better person?
I've been coughing all morning
How can I lose thirty pounds?
I've been singing a lot lately
How can you be so judgmental?
How can you do this to a kid?
How cold is it where you are?
I'll be retiring in October
I'm retiring in October
How come nobody did anything?

How did you know I had a dog?
How did you know I said that?
Tom returned to Boston in 2013
How did you make that happen?
How do you change the filter?
How do you know these things?
How do you take care of them?
Tom said he's been working out
Tom said he'd vote for Mary
How exactly did they do that?
How exactly did you get here?
Tom said the claim wasn't true
How exactly would we do that?
How likely is that to happen?

We'll miss Tom a great deal
How many of them have rifles?

How much weight did you lose?
How many people did Tom kill?
How often do you eat cookies?
Tom should've done it that way
I'll show Tom how to do that
How should we actually do it?
Tom should've kept that secret
How soon will lunch be ready?
Tom should've never been fired
How would that make you feel?
Tom didn't help us very much
How would you deal with that?
Have you begun yet?
She lives in Yoshkar-Ola
He lives in Yoshkar-Ola
Don't copy my sentences
Tom simply wasn't quick enough
Tom didn't talk about Boston
How are you all doing tonight?
How are you going to fix that?
How can it be done in one day?
Tom is afraid that he'll die
How can this possibly be safe?
How can we avoid that problem?
How can you compete with that?
How come you don't believe me?
How come you're so nice to me?
How could I have forgotten it?
How could I not be optimistic?
Tom said he'll check into it
How could it be any other way?
Tom should've hired a lawyer
How could such a thing happen?
How did I not know about this?
We're lucky that Tom helped us
How did I not see that coming?
How did the three of you meet?
How did you get into coaching?
Tom wasn't given a chance
How did you get the door open?
Tom wasn't forced to do that
How did you know I was hungry?
When should we tell Tom this?
How do people feel about that?

I can't wait to see Tom again
How much do a dozen eggs cost?
I don't like the way Tom sang
How much money did you borrow?
I don't think Tom should sing
How much money can you borrow?
How much of a concern is that?
How much sleep should you get?
Is Tom still a French teacher?
Is Tom the right coach for us?
How often do you speak French?
It's difficult to talk to Tom
How old were you at that time?
That's precisely what Tom did
How safe is this part of town?
How serious are these threats?
How soon will supper be ready?
The younger guy's name is Tom
How will I be able to do that?
This is Tom's first year here
Tom claims that he's innocent
Tom has lived here since 2013
Tom is a simple-minded person
Tom can't help us right now
He's really busy
Tom's contract wasn't renewed
Water is Tom's favorite drink
I didn't know that Tom retired
I think Tom hasn't decided yet
It's been quite a year for Tom
It's something only Tom can do
Let me fill up your glass, Tom
Let's assume that Tom is right
That tree is on Tom's property
That's what I expect Tom to do
That's what Tom said last week
Tom didn't seem impressed
Mary didn't seem impressed
She didn't seem impressed
Do you like game shows?
Tom can't control his emotions
Tom can't do it all by himself
Tom can't have passed the exam
Tom can't hide from us anymore
Tom certainly didn't know that
Tom could've told us the truth
Tom couldn't control the horse
Tom couldn't find his way back
We're going to have to do that
Tom didn't even lock his doors
We'll continue to work on that
Tom didn't have anywhere to go
Tom didn't have to say a thing
Tom didn't regret his decision
We hope that you won't do that
I beg your pardon, sir
I think I'll stay home
I think I'll stay home today
Tom didn't stay there for long
We hope that you won't be late
Tom didn't think that was fair
We didn't expect these results
Tom died from leukemia in 2013
How much do you read?
Tom died in the summer of 2013
There's not much else I can do
So, what happened?
It's so nice to be appreciated
It's time for you to come home
It's obvious that you're lying
Next week, I'm going to Boston
It isn't always cold in Boston
I don't have a ticket yet
I never would've given up
I don't feel tired at all
Everybody's excited about that
I never would've hurt you
I do believe you're right
I can't do that right now
Some people say that I'm weird
Some people think I'm eloquent
Actually, that's probably true
You've worked very hard today
You're not going yet, are you?
I've never been disloyal
There's no way you can do that
You shouldn't be in this room
I've gotten used to this
There's nothing we can do here
Why weren't more people there?
I've come to pick you up
Why don't you want to do that?
I wasn't assertive enough
I've already checked out
We can't do what you're asking
Why don't you like me anymore?
I've already checked in
Why do you want me to do that?
I'd love to do that again
Why didn't you get any apples?
I'll be in town on Monday
I'm the one who did that
I should've won
What have you got in that box?
I'll get there eventually
I'm sure I won't like it
We've made no commitments yet
I'll lend you my textbook
I'm so ashamed of myself
We're going to miss you a lot
I'll try it again tonight
I'm reluctant to do that
We're going to do what we can
I'm already working on it
I'm feeling a lot better
We should've done this sooner
I'm not expecting anybody
I'm doing that right now
We never should've gone there
I'm not sure who did that
I'm afraid I'll get lost
I'm one of your neighbors
I'm told I was a cute kid
We don't do this often enough
I've already done enough
I've done enough already
This isn't what I had in mind
I've already eaten supper
There's nothing we need to do
I've just moved to Boston
There's no money in my wallet
I've never ridden a horse
I wanted to do that, too
I've never studied French
This isn't French
It's English
That's enough food for a week
Make sure you're here by 2:30
I believe that'll happen
Let's have some fun, shall we?
It's going to be fun, I think
I know that you're smart
It's been windy all afternoon
I can't hold on any longer
I have one of those, too
It's been a tough year for me
I did really well, I think
I made a U-turn
I didn't do that very well
Don't you remember my promise?
I don't care who does that
Don't you dare try to do that
I don't care who does this
I don't use paper towels
Don't underestimate the enemy
I don't do that very often
I don't think I'm biased
I don't like chopping wood
I don't often wear a hat
Doing that would've been easy
I don't think I'm immature
I don't often tell jokes
Didn't I tell you not to sing?
I don't think I'm neurotic
I don't have that choice
I liked it, too
Did you think I looked scared?
Did you come here last Monday?
I've stopped doing that
I've never seen a whale
You'll go with us, won't you?
I have to be there at 2:30
I've hired a new lawyer
Why don't you guys like me?
I haven't eaten much today
I've grown used to this
Why didn't you bring it home?
I've been so happy here
Why are you doing this again?
I've already fixed that
Why are we listening to this?
I just wasn't ready for it
Who wouldn't want to do that?
I've already had lunch
Who said I wouldn't be there?
What inspired you to do that?
I'm too weak to do that
What do you have in that box?
I'm prepared to do that
We've got to quit doing this
I'm already over thirty
I'm already on the list
I'm already a bit tipsy
We haven't changed the rules
I'll always be with you
We don't know what'll happen
I never would've said that
I'd like to do that now
I won't stop doing this
I won't stay any longer
This hotel was built in 2013
I wasn't here yesterday
There's still a lot of learn
There's a lot to prepare for
There isn't any toilet paper
You don't need to tell Tom
That's absolutely ridiculous
I think we're all confused
Our team isn't likely to win
I thought you'd come today
I wasn't surprised by that
Mary is a plain-looking girl
I won't ask you to do that
I won't be at home tonight
I need everybody's help
It's time to stop doing this
I won't go there by myself
It's going to be challenging
It's been a challenging year
I'm seldom late for school
It didn't happen by accident
I'm the one who needs help
I don't often come here
I'm thin, but not too thin
How is the weather in Boston?
I'm very open to new ideas
I don't like doing that
How do you know how old I am?
I've already arranged that
I didn't wait very long
Do you plan to have children?
I've already set the table
Can I have some more pudding?
I've already told everyone
Are you still in high school?
I've been awake since 6:30
I couldn't help smiling
You'll never get bored here
I've never eaten Thai food
I always get up at 7:30
Why are you working so late?
I've never lived in Boston
I always get up at 6:30
Who would want to live here?
I've told you that already
What's the matter with this?
What did the specialist say?
I didn't object
We're going to have to move
I already know what's wrong
I didn't flinch
I've already said yes
I didn't buy it
We hope that you'll do that
I'm sometimes careless
I did that, too
I won't argue with you
We don't do this very often
I believe that won't happen
I don't want to give up yet
They're refusing to do that
There's no way that'll work
I know you'll agree with me
That's not impossible to do
That won't happen overnight
I sing pretty well, I think
I promise I'll do that
That wasn't what I expected
That isn't likely to happen
I think I'd like to do that
Someone's waiting to see us
I was Mr. Jackson's student
Please don't ask me to sing
I won't make dinner for you
Our house was built in 2013
I'd like to try that myself
I'll find out what happened
I like basketball, too
I'll leave Boston on Monday
I'm not in Boston right now
I hope I wasn't boring
I'm not sure what'll change
Mary is a good-looking girl
I'm pleased with the result
I don't read very fast
I don't need this much
I've done time
I can't do that without help
I've been sick
I can't do this without help
I can't sell my things
I've been hurt
It's definitely frustrating
I could've done a better job
I can't open this door
I've been away
It's a school, not a prison
I can't answer you now
I'm vulnerable
I don't need this much money
I'm very tough
Have you changed the filter?
I don't need this much stuff
I'm very messy
I don't often wear corduroys
I'm very blunt
Does this make sense to you?
I don't think I'm unbeatable
I'm still sick
Can you handle the pressure?
I don't think I'm very funny
I'm scared now
Are your eyes troubling you?
I don't think I'm very petty
I'm recovering
Are you planning to do that?
I don't think we can do that
I'm quite weak
You'd better make one, too
I've already resigned
I'm quite tall
Why are they staring at us?
I'm your new neighbor
I'm quite rich
Who should we speak to now?
I'm sure I'll succeed
I'm quite poor
What time did you get here?
I'm so glad I met you
I'm quite lazy
What does this mean to you?
I'm really very happy
I'm pretty old
What did you do about that?
I haven't done that in years
I'm not yet convinced
I'm on the job
We've got three games left
I'm not always honest
I'm not stoned
We're not afraid of anyone
I'm irritated by that
I'm not family
We're both very happy here
I'm going to be there
I'm just a boy
We're both very frightened
I'm already in Boston
I'm in my room
We're all praying for rain
I'm here again
We'll be leaving on Monday
I won't sing with you
I'm growing up
I think perhaps I'll do that
I won't give you that
I'm going deaf
We don't know who did that
I think we'll always be here
I'm frustrated
We didn't have any warning
I was inside, waiting
I'm displeased
We didn't change the rules
I'm busy again
We couldn't go any further
I think nobody's home
I'm bummed out
We can't have it both ways
I'm being sued
We can't give you anything
I don't wear a tie every day
I'm badly hurt
This won't fix the problem
I won't answer that question
I'm back early
I won't be paid until Monday
I'm back again
I'm an outcast
I'm an athlete
I'd like you to do something
I'm an amateur
I'm always happy to help out
I love Mary's perfume
I'm an acrobat
I'm fairly talented, I think
I'm already up
That's part of the problem
I'm feeling a lot better now
I'm a weakling
I'm going to propose to Mary
I'm a teenager
I'm in love with you already
I don't have a butler
I'm a survivor
I'm not interested in sports
I'm a southpaw
I'm not leaving anytime soon
I didn't wait in line
I'm a sculptor
I'm not sure what's going on
I can't do that today
I'm a romantic
I'm pretty excited right now
I can't back down now
I'm a reporter
I'm pretty outgoing, I think
I'm a preacher
I'm quite good at doing that
I'm a newcomer
Let's go down to the river
I've got to start doing that
I'm a minister
It's definitely a nuisance
I've learned a lot of things
I'm a mechanic
It's becoming more popular
I've learned from my mistake
I'm a magician
It's a dangerous situation
I've seen this movie already
I'm tired of reading
I'm a handyman
I always get up at six-thirty
I'm the bashful type
I'm a good boy
I'm still doing that
I'm a gardener
I'm proud of my work
I'm a fugitive
I can't communicate with them
I'm hardly ever late
I'm a designer
Is it difficult to do that?
I'm going to save it
I'm a crusader
I'm finished already
I'm a botanist
Don't let anybody fool you
I didn't go jogging yesterday
I'm already standing
I'm a bookworm
Do you think I look strong?
I didn't know what that meant
I'm already a father
I'm a believer
Do you know the bus driver?
I didn't know what to believe
I'll let you do that
Do you ever wear a bow tie?
I didn't want to shoot my dog
I won't sing tonight
I don't have to do that today
I won't eat anything
Why do we have to go home?
I don't like punk rock at all
I won't starve
Where do you go from here?
I don't think I'm a bad loser
I won't eat it
What's your cousin's name?
I don't want to die in prison
I wasn't too worried
What do you want for that?
What do you suppose it is?
I wasn't fired
We've fixed all the leaks
I wasn't armed
I have no pain, which is good
I think I'm likeable
I haven't been there in years
I haven't done much this week
I haven't eaten meat in years
We don't want to get lost
I hope it doesn't ever happen
We didn't have to do that
I hope that didn't offend you
I like teaching, too
They've made improvements
They wouldn't let me sing
They didn't want me there
I just can't thank you enough
That's not worth the risk
I just didn't want to do that
That's not worth our time
I just didn't want to give up
That's just how I like it
I just don't have enough time
I can't tell you why
That's just an accusation
I just don't have that choice
I've found the leak
I just don't think it's right
I've been fortunate
I'm pretty athletic
Please don't make me sing
I'm not that naïve
I'm not eating that
Mary's dress is too short
I'm not a terrorist
I'm not a good cook
I'm not a barbarian
I'm no longer bored
Let's not eat out tonight
I know I could've done better
I'm kind of thirsty
Let's not do this anymore
I'm a bit skeptical
Let's have lunch together
I'll dance with you
It's difficult to do that
It's difficult to analyze
I know you're being sarcastic
It's been cloudy all week
It wasn't really so scary
Do you think I look happy?
Did you change the filter?
You're half an hour late
You won't mind, will you?
I think I'm going to die soon
Why can't we do that now?
I think we're the better team
Who said I wouldn't help?
I think we've had a good year
What do you plan to sell?
What do we need that for?
I don't often smile
We've been working on it
We're all pretty excited
I've been disloyal
They've already fixed it
I'm seldom at home
They don't want to leave
I'm not very smart
I'm not very brave
I'm not infallible
I'm not a murderer
Mary's dress is too long
I'm not a gangster
I'm not a crackpot
I'm not a comedian
I'm kind of sleepy
I'm in a big hurry
Let's walk home together
I'm here all alone
Let's not go there today
I'm already in bed
I wasn't ready to be a father
I'm a student here
It certainly wasn't easy
I wasn't sure what that meant
I'm a patient here
Have you found a job yet?
I won't be at school tomorrow
Do you think I look pale?
I won't give you any medicine
Do you think I look cool?
I won't listen to you anymore
Did you sing by yourself?
I wonder what they'll do next
Can you guess what it is?
Are you going to do that?
I wouldn't quit if I were you
I'll be back in about a month
I like it, too
When is it going to end?
I'll die if you don't tell me
What's unique about you?
I'll get you something to eat
What's there to discuss?
I'll give it to you right now
What's the real problem?
I'll let you know what I hear
I like Boston, too
What's the matter, dear?
I'll tell you the whole story
I hope I'll fit in
What's the asking price?
I'll try to have fun tomorrow
What's that machine for?
I'm always going to work hard
What's that green stuff?
I'm doing everything I can do
I don't have a son
What'll this accomplish?
I'm doing everything possible
What happened on Monday?
I'm getting to be a good cook
I can't retire yet
What do our guests want?
I'm glad it happened this way
We're taking a big risk
I'm glad it's all working out
I've never skated
We're not all Canadians
I'm glad we're still doing it
I'm not very tall
We're all pretty hungry
I'm going to enjoy being here
I'm not a fascist
I'm happy with what I've seen
I'm not a crybaby
They say I'm a war hero
I'm just glad no one got hurt
I'm a picky eater
The brake's not working
I'm just glad no one was hurt
I'm a doctor here
That's impossible to do
I'm not doing this for myself
I'm a big boy now
I'm not even going to comment
I won't accept it
I'm not going to be a yes man
I'm not opposed to doing that
I'm off to a late start today
I'm old enough to know better
I'm prepared to talk about it
Mary isn't so beautiful
I'm pretty good at doing that
I'm really not happy about it
I'm so glad you are not upset
I'm still in a state of shock
Is doing that difficult?
Tom told me to be here by 2:30
I'm still planning to do that
How's your garden doing?
I'm think I'm pretty generous
I'm very sorry for my actions
Everything's going well
I've been drinking since 2:30
Don't be afraid to sing
I've been having a rough time
Do you think I'm biased?
I've been told not to do this
Do you have to sing now?
I've been working all my life
Do I look sleepy to you?
I've got to start working out
Can you help me do this?
I've tried doing that already
Aren't we going do that?
I've tried everything already
I can't do it all
Are you still on a diet?
You're pretty stubborn
Tom didn't give an explanation
Why would anyone leave?
That's probably what Tom meant
Why shouldn't we leave?
I've never told Tom about that
I'm stressed out
Why is truth important?
I've already told Tom about it
I'm really drunk
Why can't we do it now?
I'm very young compared to Tom
I'm not that old
Why aren't you cooking?
I'm very glad you're here, Tom
I'm not that bad
Who's going to do what?
I'm glad that Tom wasn't there
I'm not so smart
Who wouldn't want that?
I can't get my tractor started
I'm not prepared
Who wouldn't like that?
I can't let you do this for me
I'm not homeless
Where are your jackets?
I know his real name isn't Tom
I can't really comment on that
I'm not drinking
When should we do that?
I didn't like the way Tom sang
I can't say any more than that
I'm not diabetic
What's the real reason?
I didn't answer Tom's question
I can't speak to you right now
I'm not deranged
What's happened so far?
I'm not demented
What'll the results be?
I'm not autistic
What'll the outcome be?
I'm not an angel
What was your strategy?
What would you have done, Tom?
I didn't do my job well enough
I'm not a racist
What do you do all day?
Tom would've liked to do that
I didn't know this at the time
I'm not a prince
What did we do with it?
I didn't really think about it
I'm not a madman
What did the doctor do?
I didn't sleep much that night
I'm not a killer
We're all pretty tired
I didn't think I was that good
I'm not a farmer
Tom said that I can't come in
I didn't want to offend anyone
I won't bite you
I won't back off
We aren't finished yet
I don't agree with that at all
Was I supposed to sing?
I don't agree with that myself
I wasn't pleased
I don't believe we can do that
I don't care how much you make
I can't say no
I don't care who wins the game
I can't refuse
I don't care who wins the race
I can't decide
I don't care who you voted for
I don't charge for my services
How did you and Tom get along?
I don't feel frustrated at all
I don't feel the least bit sad
What are Tom's children like?
I don't follow politics at all
It's not too expensive
I don't have a house in Boston
It wasn't an easy race
I don't have a lot of problems
I don't have a phone right now
I don't have a problem with it
How do you really feel?
I don't have to be nice to you
Here's the translation
It's time for Tom to go home
I don't like dancing very much
I won't be able to catch Tom
I don't want to move to Boston
Doors open at 2:30 p.m
I wasn't sure what Tom meant
I've resigned
Do you plan to do that?
I haven't had any problems yet
I'm well paid
I parked my car behind Tom's
I hope I don't starve to death
I'm very thin
Can you jump that high?
I hope we'll get together soon
I'm very tall
I don't think Tom was joking
I hope you'll have a good time
I'm very sick
I'm very rich
I'm very fast
You voted, didn't you?
I'm unpopular
Will you be my friend?
I'm tone deaf
Where's your bathroom?
I'm the chief
I'm shivering
I'm paralyzed
There's no water left
I'm on a roll
There's no money left
I'm off today
That's still not true
I'm not weird
Is that man over there Tom?
I'm not tough
Somebody's in trouble
I think we'll have a good team
I'm not petty
Tom says he can't do that
I'm not naked
I'm no genius
I'm moving on
Let's keep doing this
I'm moving in
How deep is this pool?
I'm just fine
Everyone's interested
I'm improving
Don't leave me behind

It's unlikely Tom will do that
It's going to take a long time
It's going to all be over soon
It's fine by me if you do that
It's been really windy all day
It's OK with me if you do that
It won't be so easy to do that
If Tom wants to drive, let him
I've spoken to Tom and he's OK
I've been here for three weeks
I'm worried about Tom's future
I'm sure Tom will be all right
I'm not sure Tom will be there
I'm not going to let you drive
I'm not going to let Tom drive

October 20, 2014 was a Monday
Now isn't the time to do that
My flight will arrive at 2:30
Make sure Tom doesn't do that
Jackson is Mary's maiden name
It's only going to get better
It's definitely going to rain
It's been raining all morning

I'm glad we did that together
I'll be home all day tomorrow
I'll be here until about 2:30
I'd be willing to lie for you
I won't ask Tom to lie for me
I wish I hadn't let Tom drive
I wanted to lie, but I didn't
I usually don't eat breakfast
I tried to guess Tom's weight
I think Tom won't forget that
I should've never lied to you
I should've never lied to Tom
I knew Tom wouldn't lie to us
I haven't done the dishes yet
I don't think Tom will resign

It's our third day in Boston
It's going to happen tonight
It's going to be a long wait
It's about time to go to bed
Is this Tom Jackson's office?
Is it OK to call you tonight?

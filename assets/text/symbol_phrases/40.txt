Can you keep me up to date?
Can you keep me in the loop?
Can you keep me posted?
And what did he tell you?
That Mary dumped him.
He's never been unemployed
If you love it here, stay here
What's so interesting?
I think it's my favorite
It hasn't always been this way
Can I ask for your help?
I don't think Tom is an alien
Tell Tom that I'll be late
There's nobody like Tom
Is this place dangerous?
“Shibuya Station?
It’s not far at all from here
Tom doesn't eat beans
Do we have to do this?
I can't see it clearly
Nobody loves you, Tom
Don't listen to Tom's lies
Let's take our time

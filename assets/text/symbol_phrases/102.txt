Who is she?
Who is she speaking to?
She let go of the boy's hand
She is fair, fat and forty
She wore a long, loose coat
She's an absolute angel
She was at her wit's end
I'm afraid she can't answer
She is a clear-headed
She's tired from overwork
She's always on the go
She is a self-educated woman
She is pigeon-toed
She looks like a farmer's wife
She was a tall, slender blonde
She received a doctor's degree
She's of the Caucasian race
Did she come with him?
She doesn't hate him
In fact, she loves him
She calls her sister Mina-chan
She's a beauty from a distance
She went to the hairdresser's
She shared her husband's fate
She brushed her husband's hat
She didn't reply
She's good to me you know
She sang a song, smiling at me
She's acting on instinct
She's as pretty as her sister
She didn't give me her name
She doesn't have any friends
She's loved by her friends
I hear she's a famous actress
She's neither rich nor famous
She is, in brief, a chatterbox
She didn't show up
Will she come?
She hard-boiled the eggs
She's gone on a trip
How well she cooks!
She isn't a good cook
She'll make a good wife
Has she ever fallen in love?
She's off and running
She broke the cup, too
She bought the dictionary, too
Is she coming, too?
Is she coming, too?
I hope so.
Don't make sport of her
Don't make fun of her
Let's leave her alone
Who doesn't love her?
We'd better leave her alone
You've got to see her home
I couldn't bear to look at her
When did you see her last?
It's pride that drives her
I can't help laughing at her
Need we wait for her?
Do you know her?
She's on a roll
She's new fish in the pond
She's a lady of iron will
She's off with the flu
She's on the rolls
Sad to say, her son died young
I'm sad
Don't feel sad or ill at ease
Don't be sad
Pools of sorrow, wave of joy
Why should you be sad?
Didn't you hear a scream?
I'm tired
I'm feeling tired
Shall I take the wheel?
As I was tired, I went to bed

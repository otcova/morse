Why don't you leave with Rima?
Don't worry
We'll get through this
Ziri and I are just friends.
I think he wants more.
Ziri's heart nearly stopped
I'm saying it now, Rima..
I love you!
Ew!!!
Did you just fart?
Ziri's farts don't smell
I'll keep reporting
In your dreams, loser!
Ziri just couldn't get over it
Let's catch up at lunch
Ziri spat in Rima's face
Ziri's parents didn't show up
Give me that phone back.
Come and take it.
Oh, Ziri..
Why did you run away?
Ziri looked around, horrified
Ziri didn't show up for days
Don't talk back to your boss
Excuse me, I am an apple
They don't seem surprised
Do you carry batteries?
Does it include batteries?
It still works?
What do you want to eat?
It's all meat!
Look over here!
Someone's dropped £5.
Nice!
What's this?
All I can say is, amazing
I don't know what Tom's job is
What did Tom choose to do?
Let's let Tom choose
Let's throw Tom a party
I'm shocked that Tom did that
You're so annoying
That's getting on my nerves
You're being obnoxious
This bag cost £6
Are you going to the cinema?
She's my neighbour
I've got my doubts about that
Why is he cross?
Can you smell something?
Can you lot smell something?
Isn't that his hat?
Is that not his hat?
Have you got health insurance?
The fracture must be X-rayed
Can you act as interpreter?
Can you interpret?
He's a press photographer
She's a ballet dancer
Do you like ballet?
It's raining a lot this year
Who is the letter from?
Who brought the post?
No, I'm still looking.
It's just not working
What do I do now?
Stick at it!
Are you coming?
Can you do me a favour?
Depends what it is.
You're good at that.
Yes, he enjoys walking.
No, he always goes by car.
How do I get to the cinema?
Can you take me with you?
How deep are the oceans?
There aren't enough funds
Wear this.
I'm so tired of all this
I'm so tired of all that
I don't care for butter
I'm sure you'll enjoy it
I'm sure that you'll enjoy it
Tom hasn't seen the list yet
I've been feeling good
I've been feeling great
Seeing that, Ziri stormed out
It's paid off, too
I don't like this game
Can we play another?
You'll need gloves
It's freezing outside
It's freezing outside
There weren't any survivors
OK, guys!
Time to wake up!
Rima has a boyfriend.
Whoa!
Slow down..
Could you say that again?
Move out of my way.
Or what?
I'm coming with you.
Dream on, bro.
What is going on today?
We're losing light
We'll deal with it later
Don't cause any problems
Don't make any trouble
You'll be grandparents soon
This pear isn't ripe yet
Mary wore men's clothing
I don't know the right answer
No counter-attack was launched
Good afternoon, sir
How may I be of service?
Did you do anything at all?
She's not a prodigy whatsoever
Is this even a name?
That's not nice at all
Do you even have sex?
Watch out!
We'll get through it together
There's a calendar on the desk
We're better together
I'll give it my best
Let's finish the indica
Here's a dolphin
Do you speak Genoese?
It's raining heavily
Where's the library?
Western Sahara isn't Moroccan
After all, it's not about love
You're good at this.
The band re-formed
It's almost time to sleep
When does the train leave?
Ten to.
When do the buses run?
Twenty to and ten past.
When does the bus run?
Twenty to and ten past.
We've run out, I'm afraid.
What's up with him?
What's up with her?
Enjoy the lovely weather!
Happy Summer Solstice!
Can I just use the phone?
Of course.
We're so old
I mean, of Ukraine
Don't shoot me in the head
What if they kill her?
What if they kill him?
Where are you off to so early?
Where were they taken?
I'm not sure either
These aren't my ties
Don't be a penny-pincher
She didn't show up today?
You'll do it again
Could you ask her?
Let's ask someone
Don't try to bamboozle me
He thinks he's rich
Let's go to the market!
Where did you go on holiday?
Hello, Peter, how are you?
Good day!
She's unwell
Get a good rest!
I work on Sundays, too
I'm a very slower walker
He didn't even bother replying
He didn't even bother to reply
Here's a simple example
What the heck!
That'll be about it
Will you tell her I called?
You're in luck
It's not far from here
Everything okay, brother?
How much is that one?
I'm afraid it's not for sale.
Please, put the kettle on!
Who are you?" - "Nobody
Was just passing by.
Have a great evening!
Have a nice week!
He's always grumbling
Is he accusing us?
I'm going to the university
I'm going to university
It was in 1989
I'll be there at five o'clock
It's a picture
It's a photo
It's a photograph
We haven't visited Corsica
And who might she be?
You make me lose my patience!
He's crossed the border
Is he able to type?
I'm in the swimming pool
I'm in the pool
Does Algeria have cheap labor?
This is my favorite T-shirt
How about a round of golf?
I'd rather gnaw my hand off.
I'm not your big sister, Mary.
What are you on about?
I'm your mum.
The calm didn't last for long
It's got to be a wig
When can you give it to me?
I love you, Ziri," said Rima
I love you, too," replied Ziri
I love you three," added Walid
This isn't knitting
It's weaving
Don't worry
We're professionals
What could it be, by chance?
Don't watch me, watch Tom
They'll have to catch us first
They're both handsome
It's like a plague
I'm kind of tired of it
I'm kind of tired of this
I've abandoned the garden
I'll get dressed for church
Are you going to the dance?
Of course!
They're worshiping God
Whose clothes are you washing?
Which house do you prefer?
Zelensky is pro-West
Lithuania joined NATO in 2004
Russia annexed Crimea in 2014
That's why we were late
I've thrown that away already
How does this machine work?
It's difficult to speak French
I've met Tom many times
What was the price?
Let's just wing it
I would have gladly come!
Will you translate it for me?
Do you guys have a car?
Y'all can believe me
I'm running
Will she help us?
I have a 2D wife
I'm a man of culture
I thought they'd hear us
I thought that they'd hear us
Things aren't as they appear
She smells!
He ordered a pint.
Tom has to repair Mary's car
I don't have to shoot you
Yes, you've already said that
Is that really all?
Is that really everything?
And what did he learn from it?
I'm an inhabitant of Earth
I'm an earthling
I hope I haven't bored you
OK, what shall I sing?
All right, what shall I sing?
I've got fond memories of you
Is he a diabetic?
Is he diabetic?
Are you a diabetic?
Are you diabetic?
Have you ever had surgery?
Hello!
Anyone at home?
Yes, I'm here.
Hello!
Anyone at home?
Yep, me.
That'd be nice.
Pot, don't boil!
Here's the pot
Is it Carnival already?
How far, roughly?
He's in his forties
I tried that, too
I tried doing it that way, too
Don't eat so much meat
Do you have a lot of guns?
Are there a lot of guns?
The reasons weren't explained
This isn't a cheap hotel
What is Tom running away from?
Tom couldn't recall meeting us
I can't say why I like it
Who is Tom running away from?
Take me to Tom, please
It's a peacock butterfly
How much money did you get?
It's undue risk
You're excessively trusting
It's unduly expensive
How do they treat SARS?
We just can't move past them
It's all natural
What more can a woman do?
What more can a man do?
What more can be done?
Yes, it was good
Yes, but it doesn't matter
Yes, but that's not important
And there you go !
We'd better be careful
We'd better be very careful
Don't throw me overboard
Now's your chance to catch up
I'm in London at the moment
Have we landed?
Have we landed yet?
Have we already landed?
We haven't yet landed
It's green
Let's cross over
The light's green
Let's cross
Don't touch that switch
That's why I always lose
Let's go look at it again
It's rarely done these days
Are you going to beat me up?
Why would I beat up a girl?
Are you coming to Australia?
Will you come to Australia?
Why is Tom here?
I don't know why Tom is here
Nobody invited him.
Ziri had come.
Speak of the devil.
Just then, Ziri walked in
Without him.
Where are my kites?
Tom's a bad father
I won't obey Tom
He isn't my boss
Tom's here to meet Mary
Yanni's a blacksmith
I'm not expecting details
Have you smoked?
I'm feeling pretty safe
Tom's washing your car
Bill's in Japan
What has happened to my baby?
Mary's boyfriend is a Canadian
Mary's boyfriend is Canadian
It didn't seem that way to me
What happened is..
Earl Grey, please.
Yes, ma'am
Why did he come back?
The payment didn't go through
You're taller than my father
That joke wasn't in good taste
We've prepared a room for you
One drink and I'm out of here
We didn't eat or drink
I've been informed about that
Will Tom ever catch up?
I don't like Tom.
Neither do I.
Tom doesn't speak French.
Neither does Mary.
Get out!
This is the ladies' room!
You're in the wrong
Tear well up in Ziri's eyes
Get ready!
Departure in five minutes!
Get away and don't come back
It's a story I'll never forget
I'm going to dinner with Tom
No, I don't
I told him the truth.
I don't need a thing
Please don't bother Tom
I can't stop doing this now
I'm pretty well cleaned out
We'll make it this time
That isn't the way I'd do that
Why does he hate himself?
I've made tea
There's no way back
Tom isn't going to move
Why's this box so heavy?
Is Tom busy now?
I really should've phoned
It's a scene I'll never forget
Why did he eat the bee?
I'm happy with this approach
What did Tom send you?
I'm famous for doing nothing
What was Tom scared of?
That's not fair!
I don't know
I woke up like this.
Hello Mary!
Did I wake you?
It's two in the morning
I've been all around the world
Poor thing.
What's making you worry?
I'd like you not to lie to me
Don't turn round
This won't be easy to forget
Security!
Ziri couldn't hold it back
Get away from me!
Shut up and get in the car!
Don't come out
I love you.
I love you more, dummy.
Rima wasn't ready for a kiss
Rima banged on Ziri's door
He came out, grinning
Back off, you creep!
Never touch me again!
Who's that?
Who's that?!
Great question!
Oh, sorry, Dad!
I didn't recognize your voice!
Ziri ran off the stage, crying
Dirty is my middle name.
I'm just glad Tom is here
I know that it's you
Tom won't be at work next week
Do you often read in bed?
I knew I'd never want to leave
How soon will Tom be here?
I'm going to confide in you
So what!
Tom didn't feel scared
They've got their eye on you
Tom is very cute, isn't he?
It was pretty eye-opening
Who did Tom meet on the train?
Tom can't avoid that
You've overwatered the flowers
Don't overfeed your dog
That's a very overused cliché
Do you remember who was there?
You haven't missed anything
I'll stay with you today
I don't want this one
I don't know how to do this
That's not what I meant
I don't see any problems
Are there Christians in Egypt?
You're perfect
I can't take my eyes off you
Just then, Ziri came in
What's your name?
Ziri's lawyer showed up
Ziri moved into Rima's mansion
Move it!
Move what?
Move your ass!
Who won first prize?
The doll's eyes fell out
I shouldn't have...
Oh, cut it out, Ziri
I won't forgive you this time.
It's hardly the case
I'm sure Tom isn't a coward
How tall are you now?
Give them to me!
Tom's dog hid behind the couch
I usually get home before 2:30
Tom wasn't aware of that
How should we behave here?
Can't I just tell the truth?
Can't I tell the truth?
Why can't I tell the truth?
What horrible thing happened?
What terrible thing happened?
What terrible things happened?
What horrible things happened?
I think they're beautiful
I think it's pretty
I think they're pretty
The letters won't be delivered
Letters won't be delivered
The letter won't be delivered
However, this is not good
But this isn't good
Why should we do that now?
How can I remember kanji?
Do you feel refreshed?
Are you guys idiots?
Are you idiots?
Did you seriously do that?
Did you really do this?
What are your favorite foods?
May I call home?
Can I call home?
Was anyone in the next room?
Which is the most delicious?
Which one tastes the best?
Should I tell my mother?
Why did you miss class?
Why weren't you in class?
Was there a refund policy?
Is there a refund policy?
What's your refund policy?
Is it OK to do this?
Was that information needed?
Excuse me, may I try this on?
I'm not searching for anything
Has he gone for another smoke?
Tom won't twig
Tom won't realise
Thank you!
You've helped me a lot!
A pleasure as always.
Food's ready!
At last!
I'm starving!
Is anyone in that room?
No, no one.
What's in that box?
We haven't got time to dawdle
We don't have time to dawdle
Who ordered hot chocolate?
What is there to choose from?
Have you seen his father?
Was it announced beforehand?
Was that announced beforehand?
Could you move up a bit?
Could you budge up a bit?
Is there a bakery near here?
Will it rain tomorrow?
It's quite possible.
The post didn't come today
What's your favourite team?
Which team is your favourite?
There's a tree in the park
Now, let's start the class
Now, let's begin the class
Let's begin the class
That's hardly likely to happen
I'll use the new plates
We'll use the new dishes
I'll put money in my wallet
We'll stay in a hotel
We'll be staying at a hotel
We'll be staying in a hotel
We'll stay at a hotel
Why did you have to work late?
Are you liberal?
Where do we get off?
That's how Tom described it
Get off me, you creep!
Ziri's knees started to act up
With that, Ziri walked away
I'm going to be a father?
Are you sure?
You don't need to tell me why
Are you a liberal?
Tom didn't come to the door
He doesn't have what it takes
What time did the play start?
I'm very sorry you failed
Where was Tom sitting?
I didn't sign that document
I'll put money in my pocket
It's fun, and I enjoy it
Tom isn't as handsome as I am
Tom isn't going to call you
Tom couldn't read
I don't blame them though
“I know
Will you be my beloved?
“We are what we think
“Oh, you hate your job?
Why didn't you say so?
I've seen everything!
It's a whole different planet!
She's my sister-in-law
That's how I would describe it
Tom hasn't yet made a decision
Tom isn't your worst enemy
Who did Tom meet on the bus?
Tom can't hurt you now
That's likely to be wrong
That's likely to be incorrect
How long was Tom in a coma?
I'm afraid that Tom won't come
Have you ever dated?
Have you ever gone on a date?
You've never dated, have you?
I'll give you all I've got
Don't forget to pack a sweater
Tom wasn't done yet
Don't you try doing this again
How much does he cost?
Ziri ran away, screaming
I'm not your girlfriend.
Yeah, and that's a shame.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
Just look at you!
With that, Ziri stormed off
Don't come near me, you creep!
I love you.
I love you, too, moron!
I love you.
I love you, too, silly!
I'm... your father.
And I'm... speechless.
Hi, I'm Ziri, and you are?
I'm speechless.
Let's get you cleaned up
Well... yes!
Ziri's mouth dropped
Why do you care about Ziri?
That's my motto
Hey!
You take that back!
You've won the first prize.
Are you serious?
Are you sure?
Is your name Ziri Nani?
Sure!
Follow me to my office.
Ziri wouldn't even let Rima in
Ziri's fake mustache came off
Ziri?
Come in, come in, dear
What's going on here?
You're our new guest, are you?
Ziri's luck started to run out
Ziri's luck ran out
Soon, Ziri moved out
Wouldn't you be over the moon?
Where are you from?
My country no longer exists.
What do you mean?
It's not there anymore
Are you Russian?
I'm not even from Russia
I'll ring you again later
I'll phone you again later
You'll find out very soon
Ziri's luck has run out
He's in his kitchen, cooking
He's cooking in his kitchen
It's one of my favourite films
Has Ziri's luck run out?
Ziri's wife came up to Rima
Ziri's doctor came by
Next stop: main station
Next stop: main station
I want to get rid of Ziri.
Consider it done.
Where's my calculator?
Who else was with you?
Is Tom sure of that?
Is Tom sure about that?
They've got everything here!
I'll have chicken, then
How can I tell?
How do you mean?
I've never seen them laugh
I've got no reason to be happy
Tom can't find his sunglasses
What's the name of this drink?
Tom isn't in the garage
It wasn't possible then
What measures did Tom take?
Yay!
That's not exactly what I want
It's a linguistic hodgepodge
No, this isn't my car
Hello everyone!
How many hanzi are there?
No, of course not
I'll do that work by myself
I can't give you what you want
What's the exact time now?
I hope you'll let me help
What kind of food is that?
Tom didn't remember meeting us
Go away and don't come back
Hey, babe!
Wanna go out tonight?
Why don't you take off today?
Wow!
I'll never leave your side
I love you so much.
I love you so much, too.
Please forgive me, Rima!
Please...
I don't know...
Suddenly, Ziri leapt out
Come on!
Off to bed!
I'm going to the pharmacy
Ziri wasn't about to give up
Ziri came into Rima's office
Ziri didn't let Rima out
Ziri got into his mom's car
Get out!
Yeah, I like that
I'd love to catch up
Does Western Sahara have oil?
Why are the Sahrawis fighting?
I thought you'd be a lot older
I thought you'd be younger
What are you reading, Tom?
She couldn't do anything
Imagine you don't know me
You'll see everything yourself
How often does Tom visit you?
Dogs don't give birth to cats
I wish I knew Tom's address
We didn't see eye to eye
Tom liked Mary's cooking
You know where I've been
Tom wasn't sitting up
I don't know if Tom heard me
I want to tell you I'm sorry
Look, Tom is coming
What's there to be jealous of?
Who did Tom meet in the park?
How do I make it appear?
How do I get it to appear?
Don't get worked up," she said
We were young once as well.
Well, well!
I wouldn't have thought that
He's straightforward
Was that easy to do?
I'm just washing up
There's a yellow rose here
I'm washing up
I'm just doing the washing-up
I'm doing the washing-up
I'm taking a short cut
Why is Tom cross?
Where've you parked the car?
In the car park.
Where do you live?
I live in England.
I'm looking for a bed
I'm looking for a double room
Don't you find Tom a bit smug?
That band's excellent
What's the quickest way there?
Ziri wouldn't get away with it
That's too dear for me
Can you lower the price a bit?
That's too expensive for me
Can you lower the price a bit?
Does Ziri even know Berber?
Is there a car park here?
Just then, the lights went off
I love you.
I love you, too, silly!
Now kiss me already!
What is going on with Ziri?
Check on Tom, please
What am I to do with it?
Wow, this is a nice table
Suddenly, the light went on
Ziri's heart bubbled over
Ziri ran to Rima, screaming
Put that book away, Ziri
My mother has Parkinson's
Did you think it was tasty?
Can I talk now?
Go ahead.
Do you believe in some god?
Do you believe in God?
Let's change the subject.
Do you believe in God?
I'm gonna leave.
You still love Ziri.
You still love him.
I'm not listening.
Do you believe in God?
My God, you're so annoying!
Do you believe in God?
No!
You do!
My God, you're so annoying!
Is that my pizza?
What are you looking at?
Go away!
Ziri was at Rima's heels
I'll clean this up
I'll clean the kitchen up
Mom!
Please go to your room!
Ziri cleaned up Rima's room
Tom hasn't eaten in days
I don't like wearing ties
I couldn't decide what to wear
I've been doing this for hours
What a fucking nightmare!
No, I don't have a girlfriend
Why aren't you in bed?
Tom's cat is old
Have you decided what to do?
It's not easy to describe
I'll probably go to Boston
Perhaps I'll go to Boston
I'll likely go to Boston
I won't likely go to Boston
I'm back on my feet
I don't want a lover
Dad, where's my glass?
The things are in dad's car
Go back and sleep!
I didn't know, but I guessed
Tom wasn't far behind us
It's a piece of cake to him
It's child's play to him
But the coffee isn't good
Father, where is my glass?
I'm not fooling around, guys
We don't use that door anymore
Where's my package?
This isn't a waste of time
Deep down, Ziri envied Rima
I'm not going to remember that
Do you really need Tom here?
Who shot who?
They're my guests
They're nail clippers
Listen, stay where you are!
What's the use of wriggling?
I swear I won't do that
Tom isn't from this area
It'll happen sooner or later
Who shot whom?
Do you ever work on weekends?
Do you enjoy black humour?
I don't need to know your name
I don't know any details yet
There wasn't anything to eat
It's not mine
It's my brother's
We don't celebrate Christmas
Why didn't you remarry?
Why didn't you get remarried?
I don't know what Tom drank
We weren't allowed to enter
I'm going to leave it at that
It's awesome
Ha!
Ha!
I'm using the Internet!
Tom wasn't doing his job
Maybe I'm to blame
Don't try to save me
Half of this money is Tom's
Don't tell Tom about us
I don't know how this started
Let's do it on Monday
May I see it?
What was to be done?
Don't spank your kids
I don't like this car
Don't change that
Was Tom's room clean?
Don't talk about it any more
He doesn't live here any more
What's a kilometre, Mum?
Mam?
What?
What's a kilometre?
Here, make yourself useful
Here's 50p
Kick-off is at 2.30 p.m
Kick-off is at 2.30 p.m
I'm sure Tom would've loved it
What's the name of your band?
Is he a traitor or a hero?
I felt something wasn't right
I'd rather not be doing this
Can you describe the pain?
Why did you move house a lot?
I stayed there until 2:30
Was Tom wearing gloves?
I'm going to be a biologist
This coat is fur-lined
Ziri dialed Rima's number
Ziri's friend came over
I don't believe in voodoo
Ziri got near Rima's car
Now where could my pipe be?
How about we head back home?
This investment won't pay off
Do you like this car?
Get in quick!
I'll drive you home
Ziri got into a stranger's car
Zymurgy..
What a mouthful!
And what does it mean?
I don't accept that diagnosis
Ziri's dad came back
Ziri's dad took his mom back
Have you been on Insta?
Why did the Roman Empire fall?
Do you remember it fondly?
He's not bothering anyone
We can't give up hope
For him, time was money
I've finally made it!
I'm sure you'll like it here
Law is a subject I don't like
He's a rat!
He's a squealer!
I'll give you the best one
Tom can't go either
I'm so hungry I could faint
I've got to get away from here
I'm glad when you're glad
Please don't throw that away
I've never used that knife
Make a wish!
I'm meeting Tom for brunch
Would you like to do a dab?
Stupid cunts!
What bunch of moronic cunts!
Tom can't eat nuts
Tom can't eat seafood
I wasn't there that night
Tom wasn't a big drinker
I'm the answer to your prayers
Why don't you stick around?
Tom can't do this now
I don't really want to know
I'm not saying it's right
How many spears do you need?
How many javelins do you need?
How many spoons do we need?
We can't prove that
What an angel!
What did Tom get from you?
What's in that desk?
I'll stick around a while
How'd you get in here?
Don't say those things
Who's that with the hat?
Get me a pitcher's glove

Mr. Jackson, your rebuttal
Even the air's spicy here
You know what it is?
He's going to testify for us
Court's adjourned
Why am I so alone?
It's a racist thing to say
Did you really have sex?

I've lost faith in you
I don't know what his faith is
Is that story fact or fiction?
Let's cut across this field
He's the best man in his field
He's the fifth man in line
He's in his fifties
Let's not start a fight
I can't make out these figures
This didn't figure in my plans
I don't like modern films
Is that your final decision?
It's a fine day today
I'm feeling fine, thanks
That's fine!
Let's finish this job tonight
Will you light the fire?
Fire away!
Whose firm do you represent?
First, let me ask you this
She's forgotten how to do it
He's a former student of mine
When will he be freed?
I'm stuck in my job
Do you like French wine?
Someone's at the front door
I just don't know exactly when
I don't see any fun in it
That's not a very funny story
Is this a gag?
I'm game for anything
I gather you don't like him
Is there an air gauge here?
They're still around
They're still available
They're surrounding us
They're under arrest
They've found survivors
They've got explosives
They've got guns
This doesn't count
This doesn't help

Isn't he a gentle person?
Don't work too much!
This way, gentlemen!
When did you get my letter?
Can you get me another pencil?
We've got enough
I'll get there in an hour
I couldn't get him by phone
Those two don't get along
I'll get along somehow
I can't get at my luggage
How can I get back at him?
Can I get by the guard?
Did you get in with our crowd?
I can't get my shoes off
He's getting old
Don't get on the train yet
Let's get on with the meeting
How are you getting on?
Do you get the idea?
We've got to leave early
Is there a TV in your bedroom?
Why do you like Hawaii?
Well, girls, it's time to go
Who's giving the main speech?
Be careful!
I don't give a damn
Don't give away my secret
Who gave out the tickets?
There's a river near my house
Who gave away the bride?
I'm glad to hear you're better
We'll save you
We'll show Tom
We'll talk tonight
We've done nothing
We've got everything
We've got nothing

And how?
And why?
Goodbye," she said
The crazier, the better
Who was Queen Elizabeth?

You've got a lot of willpower
You've got a strong will
She's slim and sexy
She's strong and sexy
He's strong and sexy
In springtime, the dawn

How old are you both?
He's a total genius!
Do you like his songs?
Does he usually work late?
How much housework did you do?
Do you like these songs?
Aha!
So that's what's going on!
All right, we'll meet at five
Are these cups porcelain?
Are you interested in art?
Are you married or single?
Can you light the way?
Certainly, you're right
Did you keep your appointment?
Did you pass your math exam?
I don't like botched jobs

Tom must've known Mary
Congratulations, I guess
We didn't get our money back
Tom wasn't in prison in 2013
It's not a bug
It's an undocumented feature

Is Algeria's economy evolving?
Is Algeria truly developing?
Algeria's lakes are shrinking
He's a good diver
It's the rat race
Crying isn't just for girls

How did 2012 start?
Who am I hitting?
I'm busy, therefore I can't go

I'm an admin
No, why?

What could it be?
Can I use the Wi-Fi?
It's always someone's birthday
Thou shalt not pass!
How are things back home?
I'm scared of my alarm clock
Please don't disown me
That's a weird way to say it
Sorry, this sentence is taken
How cooperative was Tom?
We'd better be on our way
What time did Tom go home?
Tom didn't go to the library

You're not in any danger
I'm tired of these rules
I'm tired of all these rules

Everyone laughed at Tom's joke
Why are you so controlling?
It’s good to go!

How are they the same?
Fuji from here?
That isn't a bad idea

Every transaction is recorded.
Every single one?
Yup!
Tom didn't answer the door
I've officially gone crazy
I won't do it this time
This time I won't do it
What flight will Tom be on?
What exactly does this mean?
We weren't at our best today
That isn't good enough
Tom didn't try to contact Mary
In Algeria, wages remain low

I can't wait!
To the beach.

Don't study while watching TV
Happy Pride, Horus!
Happy Pride, Tom!
I'm a kitty cat
Hello, boys
Hi, kids!
How are you on this fine day?
We're not in any danger
You lowly wretch!
Could you care less?
We're renovating our house
Tom's car is old
In other words, Tom is lazy
You've got to watch this movie
You're so much happier now
I'm so much happier now
We can't reverse the process
The process can't be reversed
Say it!
I'm here waiting for you
Uh-uh.
Would you like to?
I'm now at Tom's house
I'm now at Tom's place
I'm now at Tom's
Who do these keys belong to?
You know that I'll follow you
You know I'll follow you
I'd never feed my dog a banana
Tom's plane left an hour ago
I can't eat any more
I'm full
Where's Tom's hat?
We don't know anyone in Boston
March on!
March away!
Finish it quickly!

That isn't logical
Fancy seeing you here!
Tom's a great bloke
She's travelling at the moment
It's Tom again
Do you think she is dead?

With whom did he speak?
He's drinking apple juice
You're smart, but so am I

She's afraid
Is she a vampire?
She's a translator
She's an engineer

Change the disk, it's boring!
Tom can't respond
Me too, buddy

I, too, am happy
I'm happy as well
You are my love, my angel

It's like riding a bike
That's our car
Where are your fingers?
It was a long, difficult night
Isn't that soothing?
Isn't it soothing?
Why didn't Tom go there?
Why did Tom go there?
I'm the one who went to Boston
Where did you buy this candle?
Who did that to Tom?
Was this added by mistake?
Should this be deleted?
I'll go to class
It's not easy being Tom
It's not easy being me
It's not easy being the boss
Being Tom's wife isn't easy
That is what's important
I've brought snacks
Tom went through Mary's stuff
That isn't impossible to do
You'll never be smart
Why do I keep doing this?
How do you say it in French?
Let's all eat together
We didn't take our hats off
Who'll accompany me?
It's gone midnight
At last, I managed to find Tom
Tom's cheeks were bright red
Tom is a professor, isn't he?
There's nothing I can't do
Well, tell me about it, then!
Well, say it, then!
There’s no time for this!
There’s no time!
There’s no time for that!
We don’t have time for this!
We don’t have time for that!
I don’t have time for this!
I don’t have time for that!
Who gives a damn about it?
Who cares?
Who sent you there?
It was Tom who sent us there.
Who did Tom go there with?
Tom is at his wits' end
Does Mary watch TV?
Is Mary watching TV?
Is Tom watching TV?
Is he watching TV?
The TV doesn't work well
He's probably watching TV
You don't watch TV
This TV doesn't work
Do you watch TV often?
That's an interesting sentence
Is that bacon?
Who am I, and who are you?
I'd like to come at nine
He doesn't trust you
They're going to sleep
You haven't gone to bed yet?
You're not asleep yet?
That isn't really my thing
Tom did this, didn't he?
That isn't a crime
Do you have an upset stomach?
What's "arroz a banda"?
That's Mary's ex-husband
I want to be there by 2:30
It's too heavy
I can't lift it
It's too heavy for me to lift
Where's Tom dog?
I've got to stop smoking
You've both done very well
I've lost my mobile phone
Tom's parents love me
Hey, Michael here
Don't just sit there
That isn't why I came
We're doing our homework now
We couldn't believe our eyes
I'll let Tom use my bicycle
They didn't allow me to enter
They didn't let me in
They wouldn't let me in
Are you waiting for somebody?
Maybe I'll come tomorrow
I'll come tomorrow if I can
You've never been nice to me
My dad doesn't drink.
Mine doesn't either.
We aren't geniuses
We have only three hours' time
I didn't mean what I said
Let's order in
It's a lion
When does this lesson end?
When will this lesson end?
How old is this vine?
Have you seen that person?
Could I have a fever?
Don't cross the line!
I'm sorry
I didn't mean to cross a line
What is Tom so afraid of?
This product isn't popular
I know they don't love me
It's no longer possible
Where are you going?
To Lyon!
Where's that?
I'm xenophobic
I didn't know you smoked
Since when is that a crime?
It's good that he was there
Did you talk about my book?
But I love you!
Uh...Um...No, sorry
I don't know
That's what I was getting at
Tom's been out of it lately
I'm going camping with Tom
The acting wasn't great
I don't intend to fly anymore
That's a great milestone
Save now!
He's an energetic man
You're still weak
Mary doesn't speak Galician
Is Amharic a Semitic language?
What is a furry?
Where's the beef?
2020 was a bad year
Is mayonnaise an instrument?
I already know Tom's opinion
Don't hug me, I'm scared
I'm a maniac
I told Tom I couldn't sing
We'd be glad if Tom left
That's not your book
Doesn't that scare you?
I won't help you next time
Math is really hard!
You can't be my professor
Why are neighbors so gossipy?
Why won't you marry me?
Why's everyone staring at us?
Why's everybody staring at us?
Tom needn't have gone there
That doesn't scare you?
What's making you sad?
Would you like to tag along?

We're proud of our work
I thought the movie was great!
Here he is showing up!
Can I buy a ticket to heaven?
That's just super
I'm filled with happiness
That's not what's important
That isn't what's important
Tom was a baby in 2013
Come inside, Tom
I hope that Tom doesn't see us
I hope Tom doesn't see us
We're so much happier now
I'm a lot like my father
When did Tom start doing that?
I'll study French at home
I'll try this one more time
Is that insect repellent?
Didn't I tell you to leave?
I'll see you in next week
We won't see Tom there
We won't see Tom

What did you just say?
I said 'thank you.'
No, you said 'fuck you.'
I heard you.
Fuck you!
I only told you 'thank you.'
Why are you being so rude?
Go fuck yourself.
You're insulting me, here.
You are insulting me.
I didn't insult you.
Yes, you did, motherfucker.
We don't know who they are
Is it mine or yours?
I know you can't see him
I know you can't see Tom
I'm here live
They're vegans
You like jazz?
I don't know how to say that
Will we get any supper?
Can you stop annoying me?
Are you my mother?
Nice!
We're demons
It's what we do
It can't be repaired
It can't be mended
It's irreparable
Later, others came
Later, others also arrived
Later on, others arrived
There's no getting it back
There's no turning back time
Who's seen my book?
Why don't you ask him?
Why not ask him?
It's chilly outside now
It's a cool bag

Did you know who Maisie was?
She's more famous than him

That isn't exactly true
Don't ask me to join your club
That isn't quite true
That isn't completely true
Don't you dare close your eyes
I don't care
I didn't look that up at all
Do you know its etymology?
Je t'aime.
Thank you, I love you too.
Say 'I love you' in French.
Je t'aime.
Thank you, I love you, too.
I'm scared
I know people who've done that
I didn't see Tom arrive
That's not a bird, is it?
No, I didn't go to Torino
I'm Leonardo
There's reason to hope
Am I mistaken in some way?
Why do dogs bark?

What do you mean?
Don't tell me that.
Yes, I will
I love you.

Abort mission!
Abort mission!
They'd have fun
I'm your friend.
I'm tired and bored
I haven't done that today
Has this happened to you?
Have you met Yanni?
Come rub my back.
It's simply obvious
Hey, come rub my back.
I'm not your bitch.
They didn't write anything
Tom's selling his condo
I've only got one lesson today
It's pretty far from the city
What will our future be like?
Wait, what?
It's a regional dialect
I'll say what I think
I'm going to say what I think

The people didn't believe me
Do they know how to write?
I don't know whose fault it is
I said I didn't know you
Can I do that?
Are you sure?
I'm afraid Tom won't come
What did you do to my car?!
Let's get out of here!
I'm glad to be by your side
He's just a kid!
I hope it's not impossible
Smart kid!
She's very patient with me

Depends on your beliefs.
No gods, no masters
Can't we see each other now?

Tonight, it's snowing
Should I tell her?
I don't know
Should you?
Should I tell him?
I don't know
Should you?
I'm not really sure about this
It's not too late to turn back

Maybe we should pull over.
Are you crazy?
Keep driving!
I will never accept this!

How do you handle flirtation?
How do I handle flirtation?
I hope I'm imagining it
I hope I'm just imagining it
Skura is flirtatious at work.
She has always been a slut.
Yanni didn't pay attention
How do women flirt?
How do men flirt?
Yanni can't help it

A bit tipsy?
He just threw up on Mary!
What country was he born in?
I can't go back to my city
They'll leave soon
I don't need power
Is Tom also coming?
The fridge is empty!
I want to buy a 32" TV
Don't forget to get vaccinated
He wouldn't stop crying
Men don't do that
They're strange
Do I have a cold?
Do I have a flu?
I'm busy this week
Married men don't do that
I can't dye my hair
My mom would kill me!
Most men wouldn't do that
This week, I'm busy
Please don't message me
We'll do whatever you say
Don't cause a commotion

I've got a cold sore on my lip
I'm scared to make a mistake
We don't have much time
I'm engaged in a new business
I haven't been to work
I've stayed at home all day
I'd hoped we'd become friends

Where's the ladies' toilet?
Where's the ladies' loo?
Girl, you look fab!
Mi casa, su casa
The cave-man spoke Toki Pona
I'm fluent in English
You mustn't tell Tom anything
I'm fed up with updates
It's murderously hot today
Don't wait up!
We're taking piano lessons

The wine's bad
Don't blame yourself!
Don't defend the separatists
Algeria won't be divided
Who cares?
Let's talk about Algeria today
Algeria is not a "new country.
This doesn't change things
Black lives matter.
Palestinian lives matter, too.
France left Algeria in 1962
Long live comrade Ho Chi Minh!
Algeria has 58 wilayas
What's trolling?
She's Kurdish, not Turkish
He's a whiner
Can Algeria become rich?
Where is Yongbyon island?
What happened?
Can you sell it to me?
I haven't had any coffee today
Never eat soggy waffles.
I can't pronounce this word
Why did I find that so funny?
Don't fawn on me
I don't like it
Feed me!
Next year come sooner!
Yanni is a trans woman.
No, you mean he's a trans man.
No, she's a trans woman.

Really?
How come?
Your language doesn't exist.
Really?
How come?
Does she have free time?
It's hauntingly beautiful
They couldn't find this place
This vacuum sucks.
Please, shut up already
The more you do, the better
Yanni read Skura's email
How did you become an admin?
They're closed now
Here's how the song goes
I'm sorry if I was rude to you
Let's eat, people!

Have you tried working out?
What's Algeria's GDP growth?
Morocco's plan backfired
Haha, just kidding... unless?
Algeria was liberated in 1962
Yanni is Skura's ex-partner
What are Yanni's values?

Yanni isn't gonna be happy
It's probably a tough time
There wasn't even sex

Yanni heard Rima's concerns
He's still alive and kicking
He's still going strong

He didn't even look at me
She didn't even wave at you
She didn't even look at me
I can't defeat the final boss
That money isn't mine
That money's mine
Let's play tag!
Well, excuse me, princess!
Tom's funk band was in a funk
Is that ours?
Is this ours?
Now it's getting complicated
It's getting complicated now
She went to the doctor's
There's that noise again!
Can you hear it?
That's Tom snoring.
There's that noise again!
Can you hear it?
It's Tom
He's snoring.
I've got nothing to write on
Tom, why did you do that?
Tom, why have you done that?
Come on!
Get up!

What colour are the tyres?
It's just his way.
Can I borrow that?
I'll give it back tomorrow

Where are you from?
I come from Algeria.
What herbicides do you use?
Tom didn't like living alone

Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone there?
Hey, does anyone have any gum?
I can't call anyone right now
I'm not folding their shirts
What did you just say to Tom?
When's Tom due back?
Nobody's going to believe that
Why did you lie to Tom?
We're in 2013
I'm quite embarrassed now
Nobody'll ever find us here
Tom ran over someone's dog
You're avoiding my question
Somebody's watching us
Nobody's allowed to do that
Someone's waiting in the lobby
Someone's trying to kill us
Forget it!
Why is everyone staring at me?
Can't someone else do that?
Did anyone else get hurt?
Did someone pay for this?
Is there somebody else here?
Has anybody else seen this?
Can't someone else do this?
Has anyone else seen this?
Was it a hot poo?
It could've happened to anyone
Where is your garbage can?
Tom couldn't have done this
I've got bigger problems
I'll buy you another one
I'm a good guesser
I'm a little curious
You've cleaned your feet
I can't play piano
Come to Chile again!
This is just racism!
That's not okay
I'm not calling you by name
Don't love everything you see
Don't say everything you know
Don't do everything you want
What a collection!
Quick, hold onto this tree
I don't know
Tom!
Tom hasn't eaten supper yet
It's very easy to understand
I don't believe a word you say
The birds are singing!
Isn't it beautiful?
NO!
Father!
What happened?
Wait, what the hell is this..?
It's a book.
What book—" "Read the book!
You goose.
It's all shit to me.
Who the heck's book is this?
I'm looking for work, too
Who's coming to see me?
I didn't forget about you
Or, is it the bagel?
I'm prone to forget names
I liked the present a lot!
She's a fantastic person
He's a fantastic person
In any case, I should call
Don't think about the price
Are you ready for tonight?
I don't like hitchhiking
I don't like filthy cops
No, this is my second time
Tom's son is John
Tom's son is called John
John is Tom's son
You're really an angel
Have you ever fallen in love?
I'm a little hungry right now
Do you want to take a walk?
No, not at all!
He's looking at you
Do you know him?
He's an Olympic swimmer
I asked you a question.
I didn't hear you.
You think that Tom is evil?
Good work, Tom
He's kinda cute
You can't unring a bell
You're no longer my daughter
You're no longer my son
I'm not bragging
How fast can a year go by!
She's under the chair
He's under the chair
I'm very modest
No, he didn't harass me
Please don't judge me
I'm not proud of my daughter
I'm not proud of my son
Why am I stupid?
I'm not trying to impress you
Thanks, Tom
You've been a big help!
I've had a little bit too much
I'm getting sleepy again
Tom doesn't look reassured
We're looking for Tom
Tom isn't going to argue
Tom isn't going to change
Tom couldn't help but listen
What's Tom rambling on about?
She's not interested
Tom said he wasn't interested
I assume you're not interested
Tom isn't really interested
He's just being polite
What sorcery is this?
I'm interested in your work
Clearly you're not interested
I thought you'd be interested
Look, I'm not interested
That's all I was interested in
Well, I might be interested
Yeah, I'm interested
How long will you be in Korea?
Shall we dance a bit?
Where's Minnesota?
No, I'm asleep.
It doesn't matter, Tom
They still taste good.
I'm from Hungary
So you do believe me?
That's how we first met
I don't want to cry
You can't change the past
Who's the lucky girl?
Who's the lucky guy?
It's hard to understand you
You're hard to understand
You're very hard to understand
It's quite humid
It's very humid
It's really humid, isn't it?
Is the dog yours?
This isn't my dog
Where is Poland?
Where's Poland?
Why have I done such mistakes?
This, however, is not possible
He's a fan of Sex and the City
I don't believe this story
We'll celebrate tonight
I'm here for work
Why did you do that?
Who is he and what's his name?
I'm not much of an athlete
I don't believe Tom's story
He's materialistic and shallow
I'll get the food
I'll get the others
I'll take a look
I've got to get to class
I've said I'm sorry
Are you looking for Tom?
That's exactly what Tom said
It isn't your fault
It wasn't a crime
It'll be dark soon
It's been done before
It's a strong possibility
I'm sorry this happened
It's starting to rain
We're not Bengali
It's not your fault
It's only three o'clock
Can you spell it?
It'll have to wait
It's been a long week
That hurts!
We're all doomed!
Are you a musician?
He's not that cute
He's independently wealthy
He's drop-dead gorgeous
He's rather handsome
Don't tell Tom I said that
What's her boyfriend's name?
I don't have everything I need
Who did you get that from?
Don't lie to me again
But I do like that, mortals
I guess it's decided
I'm speaking Spanish to my cat
Do you enjoy mystery novels?
Here's a treat for you
The rain's not letting up
I was disgusted, too
I'm glad you approve
I'm using the computer
I don't know where to put it
I don't know where to put them
I'm going to become the best
I've got to drink your cola
I'm coming for you
I'll get the guns
I'm not a drunk
I'm used to this kind of cold
I'm used to this kind of heat
I sure could use some shut-eye
Not if you win.
I'll be right back
Let's check the map
Let's have a party
You abandoned me!
I'm just having fun
I'm not buying it
I'm sick of running
I like what you're doing
That could've been prevented
That's a safe assumption
I've got a big day ahead of me
Let's have a chat
Let's try one more
Let's try one more time
Let's try once more
Let's try doing that again
That's also irrelevant
I'm chatting online
It's not a dog
She has two sons, I believe
Tom, bring me a sandwich
I've had too much to drink
Where did they send you?
I'm having trouble sleeping
Let's play some cards
Keep quiet, will you?
It's getting cold again
I'm playing a game online
So why am I crying again?
I'm not your friend anymore
I'll always be your friend
Do you need something?
Yes, I need to talk to you.
I've got some dust in my eyes
I don't feel like playing
Try and catch me!
Don't worry
You'll make new friends
I'm starting to lose hope
You don't really care about me
I don't feel good
I've got sore eyes
Does your throat hurt?
Yes, a little.
I couldn't sleep last night
Does your chest hurt?
No, not at all.
What have I got, doctor?
A cold.
Do I need a shot?
I don't know
I just made it up.
I didn't write this sentence
I didn't write this letter
It's probably just the wind
She didn't write back
He didn't write back
Tom didn't write Mary back
Tom didn't write back to Mary
He wasn't interested
I don't trust her
I don't trust him
Where have they gone?
I was hoping I'd see you again
These candles aren't white
This candle isn't white
I'm having sex with you
I'm eating cheese
I've had worse offers
Is this an actress?
It's the flight from Recife
This cat doesn't chase mice
This person doesn't live here
Is that Wall Street jargon?
We're all unemployed
It's easy to understand
It's not like that
I'll send my mother a letter
It's not too far
It's not too far from here
It's not too far from Boston
It's not too far to walk
It's quite a ways from here
Why would he lie about that?
I've had enough of your lies!
Are those flowers for me?
I'm innocent!
They didn't need to come
He doesn't want anyone to know
She doesn't think so
You don't think so
He doesn't think so
I married on the 1st of June
I'm at the station now
Roma" is an anagram of "amor.
This is Copacabana!
I couldn't hold back my tears
I have a boyfriend.
Since when?
This is the 10 o'clock news
What heavy traffic!
What lovely weather!
Onwards, to glory!
Fuck your old mother!
They aren't hungry
This makes me smile to death!
This is very funny!
This makes me laugh to death!
Mary didn't keep her promise
Who do you think we are?
Who is confused?
It's a difficult language
Will there be a cake?
How frequently do you fart?
Is this Sonisphere?
I'm not proud of my behaviour
Who's tired?
Who's confused?
I'm not proud of my behavior
I'm not proud of how I acted
Fortunately, she didn't die
She's not German, but Austrian
Where's Minsk?
I get paid 300,000 yen a month
Come on, be honest
You've been very helpful
I don't know where you live
I'm a heroine
Where is your book?
On the desk.
I'm a fucking economist
Art thou being serious?
They don't like cats
Do you want to eat meatballs?
Your Majesty!
Oh, the gayness!
YOUR MAJESTY!
What?
Mind your mouth!
How?
My ship will protect me!
Where does Marika live now?
Why are you so serious?
Whose serve is it?
Where did you buy that skirt?
When is blueberry season?
When did you seed the lawn?
What's your rush?
What size are these shoes?
We don't want to be separated
Tom's hair is all silver
Tom's grandfather was a slave
They sought Tom's help
There's no sense in doing that
There's a slight difference
That's a simple matter
Snap out of it!
Smell what's in this bottle
Slow down!
Sit down over here, won't you?
Serve the coffee now, please
There's too much smoke in here
May I have a second helping?
May I be seated?
Let's slip away quietly
Let's sit this dance out
Is this sterling silver?
Is this bolt secure?
Is it a slow train?
I've never sung this before
I'm selling my car at a loss
I'm dying for a smoke
I'll see you to the gate
I'd like to see more of you
I slipped up badly, didn't I?
I don't have any small change
I don't get enough sleep
How well can you skate?
How much do eggs sell for?
How does that seem to you?
First, I can't go
Don't slip on the ice
Do you smell smoke?
Do you know how to sew?
Did you sell your old piano?
Can you see in this light?
Blood rushed to Tom's face
Now it's another thing
What's the go?
You'd better watch Tom
You went to Boston, right?
You should've visited Boston
Why didn't Tom come?
Why didn't Tom come with you?
Why did you run off to Boston?
Why did you come to Boston?
Why are you still in Boston?

What's gotten into Tom?
What's been bothering you?
What time is it now in Boston?
What time is it in Boston now?
What happened with Tom?
What happened to your ankle?
What happened in Boston?
What do you think of Boston?
What do you do in Boston?
Were you really in Boston?
We're talking about Tom
We're going to Boston
We got married on October 20th
Was Tom telling the truth?
Was Tom in Boston yesterday?
Tom's office is on Park Street
Tom's last name is Jackson
Tom's appointment ran late
Tom went to Boston in 2003
Tom walked over to Mary's desk
Tom told me you're from Boston
Tom said he'd walk Mary home
Tom moved to Boston in 2003
Tom lives at 333 Park Street
Tom knows what's in the bag
Tom knows what's at stake
Tom knows what it's for
Tom knows time's running out
Tom knows this isn't good
Tom knows this isn't any good
Tom knows there's a problem
Tom knows that's no good
Tom knows it's too late
Tom knows it's his call
Tom knows it's a lie
Tom knows it can't happen
Tom knows I've been shot
Tom knows he's being watched
Tom knows he can't win
Tom knew I'd be there
Tom knew I'd be awake
Tom keeps saying he's innocent
Tom isn't wearing any pants
Tom isn't really listening
Tom isn't quite himself lately
Tom isn't one of us
Tom isn't one of them
Tom isn't listening to Mary
Tom isn't listening anymore

Tom couldn't have helped Mary
Tom couldn't have done better
Tom couldn't go with Mary
Tom couldn't get a job
Tom could've taken the money
Tom could've stopped it
Tom could've saved himself
Tom can't hurt you anymore
Tom can't be in Boston
Tom and I aren't divorced
There's nothing wrong with Tom
There's no place like Boston
There's a lot to see in Boston
That's what Tom would say?
That's what Tom would do
That's what Tom said to Mary
That's what happened to Tom
That's what got Tom killed
That's not what Tom wants
That's not what Tom said
That's how Tom did it
That's exactly what Tom thinks
That's entirely up to Tom
Tell Tom I'm coming over
Tell Tom I'll call back
Stay out of Tom's way
Something's worrying Tom
Of course, I told Tom
Of course, I remember Tom
May I call you Tom?
Let's take a trip to Boston
It's snowing in Boston
It's not the job
It's not far to Boston
It's nearly midnight in Boston
It's 2:30 in Boston now
Isn't that what Tom said?
Is Tom on any medication?
Is Tom going with you?
Is that where Tom is?
Is that what Tom wants?
Is that what Tom meant?
Is it far from here to Boston?
Is Boston very far away?
Is Boston far away?
I've visited Boston twice
I've visited Boston before
Is that true?
I've had enough to eat for now
I've gone to Boston twice
I've eaten enough for now

I was born in 1995 in Boston
I really should've known that
I live at 333 Park Street
I haven't been to Boston yet
I arrived in Boston at 2:30
How's the weather in Boston?
How will you go to Boston?

May I hold your hand?
Can I hold your hand?
Is it OK if I hold your hand?
What is she dancing to?
What are they dancing to?
We're sorry
I'm sorry I disappointed you
When do the fireworks start?
Mary's husband is rich
I’m getting a 404 error
What beautiful teeth you have!
I'm going to do some shopping
Why can't people hibernate?
I make 100 euros a day
I'm now sitting at my computer
I'm not worried about you, Tom
I'm worried about Mary
I'm not worried about Tom
I'm worried about you, Mary
Is it the truth?
I'm so sick of being sweaty
I'll be flying to Germany
I'm dangerous
Is there any milk left?
I trust you're well
Don't laugh at his expense
Why should he leave?
Do any of you have a pencil?
Does anybody have a pencil?
Does everybody have a pencil?
It's Tom's fault!
Who won the Superbowl?
I'm sorry
There's no reason to be afraid
Do you love me?
I don't know.
Does he have feelings for me?
Why is Tom so gloomy?
What'll grow in this soil?
That's not so!
It certainly is so.
So far, I'm bored
Not so much pepper, please
Is the beam solid or hollow?
If I can do it, so can you
I'm not drunk
I'm as sober as a judge
I want to go home.
So do I.
Don't let it get soiled
Could I have some towels?
I wouldn't accept this bribe
Make her move!
Fine", said Tamás
What's the fuck ?
What does the fox say?
This is last month's magazine
This is yesterday's newspaper
Where's today's?
This is yesterday's newspaper
Where's today's paper?
Mary can't come
It's brutal
He's brutal
She's brutal
You're in the right place
Fine, who are you?
What's happened, has happened
It's history
At least 100 people attended
Virtues!
Who knows what virtues are?
Not I. Not anyone
That is why I don't sleep
Which book are you reading?
Tom knows Mary's husband
Tom didn't fool me
That's what I was looking for
I'll be flying to Boston
What incredible memories!
I'm watching figure skating
Being a good actor isn't easy
It's following instructions
Or, not feel
That's where I live
You're my teacher and my wife!
Are you sleepy, honey?
If you want, we can talk later
We'll be at home today
Can I work here?
Who, being loved, is poor?
Love is wonderful!
Let's get started!
Are you sure about it?
That's very ingenious
Tom thinks you're cute
What did you say?
Is she a girl or a woman?
Don't smoke in bed
Please don't smoke in bed
(Ray Kroc)
I've always been a freak
I'm one of those people
I can't forget her eyes
I can't forget her look
I can't forget her smile
I can't forget her voice
I can't forget her beauty
I can't forget her kindness
I can't forget her softness
You still love her, don't you?
When it rains, he feels blue
Tom's definitely not stupid
He's stupid lazy
I'll never forget Tom's smile
I'm in Modena
Can I share?
Do you have a lot of money?
Is the meat good?
Is the lake deep?
Is the book boring?
Is this book boring?
Is this lake deep?
Tom doesn't have a cellphone
What was Tom afraid of?
What were you afraid of?
What's wrong with Tom?
We're pretty busy right now
Were you frightened?
However, you made a few errors
I'm not arguing with you
I'm not tired at all
Hey!
They won't be shot
I want that book, please
She's dancing with another man
He's dancing with another girl
We're looking into the problem
I can't find Tom anywhere
Is this really that important?
What colour is his hair?
It's not Tom I'm worried about
She fainted, but soon woke up
Have you come to arrest us?
I'll be with you
I'm sorry
I didn't mean it
It's me, Marika, your wife
Can you keep your mouth shut?
I didn't expect to see you
They're using you
This thing won't last long
We're not married yet
What else do you like?
You're making a grave mistake
You're doing the right thing
You should've seen Tom
You should've gone north
Tom can't have gone very far
It's not all that uncommon
I'll see the president myself
I'm pregnant
You're on my side, aren't you?
I've got nothing to tell you
It's an order
It's a trap
Don't tell me he's dead
Freeze right there!
He hired Tom to kill Mr. Smith
He's one of my best men.
If you say so.
He's out there somewhere
How do I look?
Don't translate this sentence
I'm not a squirrel
Who started the fire?
Who spread that rumor?
Where are the stables?
What started the fire?
We've spent too much time here
Tom's life was spared
There's a south wind blowing
Let's split the profits
It's not raining hard
It's just a sprinkle
It's good roasted on a spit
If it tastes bad, spit it out
I'm in low spirits today
I'll do it in my spare time
I hope you're in good spirits
I don't have much to spend
I don't believe Tom is a spy
I can't stand that man!
How did you stain your dress?
Don't bother standing up
Can you spare a cigarette?
What did she mean?
What a wonderful lady!
Did you fall from the sky?
What a fool he is!
We'll meet you out front
What's there to talk about?
Tom did something I'd never do
What!?
I'm sure she'll like it
I'm sure he'll like it
I'm sure Tom will like you
Wake up, please
How many sisters have you got?
Look out!
There's a lorry coming!
You're one lucky girl
You're a lucky girl
Tom says he'll never go again
Oh, sorry for not noticing you
Tell me Tom's email address
Tom isn't fine
Why do fools fall in love?
Do you have a map?
Everybody's talking about it
How are you two getting along?
I think I'm in love with Tom
What am I doing wrong?
Why are you mad at me?
I'm not mad at you!
You're young
What are you trying to hide?
Nothing.
What if my parents find out?
What if your parents find out?
What if Tom finds out?
He's cute and funny
Who gave this to you?
I wasn't implying anything
Get out!
And don't ever touch me again!
I don't care about Instagram
Don't be silly
Are you angry at me?
Why are you avoiding me?
There's no need to explain
Why are you being so distant?
Why isn't it red and puffy?
Are you ready for tomorrow?
It's snowing outside
I'm easily influenced
The rain became more intense..
We're very proud of you!
Will you go on a date with me?
Why are the nights so dark?
Don't worry!
Well, that's rather bizarre
This is my teammate, Donnavan
Is this you?
Have you been in Rio?
I'm just being sarcastic
I'm just being me
She's just being snobbish
So, be my guest!
Is that true?
He won't be ready
Watch it and dance!
You're not yourselves today
What is that on the plate?
Why are you grinning?
Is that true?
Is that Tom calling again?
I know where I'm going
It's a good question
When and where shall we meet?
No.
You don't...?
I had one, but now I don't.
Why did you stop me?
Dad, a UFO!
It's a UFO!
Maybe 50 or so?
Do you want to play shogi?
Are you sure?
You won't regret it later
Where is my wallet?
Nevermind!
Hey, can you help me?
Oh, nevermind!
Tom won't be here much longer
Someone's been very busy
That's not scary
C'mon!
English is easy!
It's not that far from here
Tom got married at 26
Tom wears black-rimmed glasses
Tom's condition worsened
Let's try calling Tom
I'm really stuck!
How is Cristian doing?
Either he goes, or I go!
Either she goes, or I go!
Either they go, or I go!
Either Tom goes, or I go!
Either Mary goes, or I go!
You're next, Tom
I'm not going to go back
She's with Tom
What's WhatsApp?
Do you have a smartphone?
Is that even legal?
She's gone to the stadium
We be of one blood, thou and I
I don't want to be evil
Who will win the gold?
Who will win the gold medal?
I'm afraid of Putin
Is it already open?
It's already open
I guess it's too late now.
No, Tom
It's never too late!
Get out of the shower!
Tom, get out of the shower!
What's your name?
Tom.
What's the rest of your name?
My name is Tom, just Tom.
He was tall, slim and strong
I don't have a landline
You don't have to tell me
You're too hard on yourself
Have you been there yet?
How do you spell YMCA?
Was this Tom's plan all along?
Hey, look what I can do!
Hey, look what I can do!
I'm trying to work, Tom.
She's an ungrateful child
We won't be here much longer
He won't be here much longer
She won't be here much longer
It burns!
Are Tom and Mary dating?
No, they're just good friends.
Now I've told you everything
But I've got an afterthought
Would you like to hear it?
Get off your tush!
It's a thing of the past
Er, who would that be?
Is it someone I know?
Yes, I like it
I wore my clothes inside-out
Why are you driving west?
I wasn't in the office then
I don't know what happened
What are you feeling?
Ah, it's almost time for exams
I'm dead!
Hurry up or we'll be late
So this is your company?
It's really pretty here

I think we're finished here
I think we're going to be late
I think we're going to be OK
I think we're in trouble
I think we're out of gas
I think we're pretty lucky
I think we're related
I think we're safe for a while
I think we're safe here
I think we've got a problem
I think we've made our point
I think we've seen enough
I think you know why I'm here
I think you'd better leave now
I think you'd better leave
I think you're in danger
I think you're probably right
Don't make mistakes!
You don't need the money
There's a book on my desk
You like baseball?
Tom can't tie his shoes
That's all in the past now
I'd like a little help
Tom can't tie his own shoes
Why are there so many people?
Will you be there Saturday?
Are you an exchange student?
Where do I sleep?
Where is the blanket?
Tom's shoelaces are untied
Do you still hate Esperanto?
The revolution won't be sober
She's married to a dentist
He's married to a dentist
Let's listen to music
Are you making a scene?
Don' translate word for word!
I'm not good at pretending
He's fit and muscular
What if he says no?
What if she says no?
He'll be asleep
I'm not a coward
No, my name is not Maria
Don't say that you're bad
Ever!
You're doing so well!
Congratulations!
She doesn't want to judge him
I'll translate for you
How can I get a bus here?
Will you come to my party?

What happened?
Nothing.
I won’t be fooled
I don't like this song
It's 5:00 a.m. here in Brazil
I love you so much, Mom!
It's an honor to meet you
Urgently!
Come back here!
Pay attention to what he says!
I'm not perfect, I know that
That's a really big apple
It's a very big apple
What color is Tom's hair?
What color are Tom's eyes?
What color is Tom's dog?
What color is Tom's car?
It's more than tolerable!
I've got a car
I'll buy a pen from him
Tom laughed at Mary's jokes
Why are you talking like that?
Tom didn't see Mary anymore
You're parked in my spot
You're sitting in my seat
You're drinking out of my cup
You can't exist without water
How do you write ‘pretty’?
Salt, please
Is this Tom?
I'm as old as you
Are you online?
I'm looking for my friends
Which title did you choose?
I'm fatigued
He's always late to class
You're a douchebag!
Luke is Laurie's brother
My ears are bleeding!
I'm going out with Peter
I'm from Milan
He's supported by his family
We didn't ruin our clothing
I didn't ruin my clothing
You didn't ruin your clothing

She's destroying her clothes
Mary's destroying her clothes
We're destroying our clothes
He's destroying his clothing
She's destroying her clothing
I'm not ruining my clothing
I'll ruin my clothing

She didn't know that
I'm glad you reminded me
I don't know when he's coming
At my sister's
Come to us tomorrow!
Lead your friend to me!
He's standing outside the door
I don't know German
I can't sell at this price
Where do you know that from?
Put the glass on the table!
Go across the river!
Go after him!
Follow him!
I'm not very well
I haven't seen you in a while
Sit down, please!
It will be my pleasure!
May God help you!
Sleep well!
Did you have breakfast?
Lay the table!
We didn't expect guests
I ask you, please eat!
I'm waiting for your wife
Excuse me!
Speak slowly!
I understand you!
Have a seat, please!
You are welcome here!
Do you speak Elvish?
Run fast!
What word is that?
This wasn't my mistake
Tom didn't like his name
I've had enough of your crap
Will he call me this morning?
Why did you open your mailbox?
Tom doesn't smile very often
You wouldn't be able to tell
They won't be able to tell
I'm not lazy but diligent
Above all, don't panic!
Alright, guys, let's do this!
Don't mumble your words
Objection, your honor!
Please, let me out!
I will be good, I promise!
There's got to be a better way
This is one BORING movie!
Wow!
I don't get it!
This is Ms. Müller
What did he want?
What did she want?
They're inseparable
What were you thinking about?
Tom doesn't work anymore
Why don't you calm down?
You're really making me cringe
I'm flying to Germany
Thank you so much, my friends!
I'm ugly
That one's OK
I'm flying to Boston tomorrow
Who will give more?
I'm not a manager
There's a cat there

Tom, wake up
Wake up, Tom
So, what happened this time?
And how do you like this work?
I'm not the manager
Can you speak Uyghur?
You can't run away from age
I'm born in the U.S.S.R
Am I going the right way?
I think I'm going to stop now
I never lie..
Never, or at least very seldom
I got it!
The answer is 24, right?
Who cares?
I'm learning Chinese on my own
If he knew, he would tell us
I'll take it as a challenge
She doesn't eat the red apple
He doesn't sleep
He doesn't run
You don't walk to school
I don't sleep in a bed
I'm from Estonia
We shouldn't spend money
He flat-out lied
I don't have much time
Would you please hurry up?
When do you go to sleep?
Have you had breakfast?
It's time to play the joker
I don't choose your ties
She doesn't speak my language
I had some calls to make, too
Am I very nice?
Who is your best friend?
Do you enjoy Mary's company?
Is Mary attractive to you?
Do you find Mary attractive?
Does Tom live far from here?
Does Tom live far from you?
Do you write short stories?
You're a compulsive complainer
You're trapped
Surrender!
You've been captured
Surrender!
I'll kill it
That was absolutely awesome!
I'll be leaving this evening
What did she bring with her?
Why aren't you coming?
Because we don't want to.
Why aren't you coming?
Because I don't want to.
Please wait a minute!
It's already midnight
Is the game still going on?
I know why he's doing this
Are you serious?
Are you serious?
I don't know why Tom got sick
What did Tom bring?
What did Tom bring with him?
Who did Tom bring with him?
Who did Tom bring?
It's my turn now
It's not always easy
I don't do it for money
Go to bed!
Don't be a spoilsport
We're all going to die!
He's way out of my league
This one's full
I can't leave you behind!
I can't leave him behind
I can't leave her behind
Don't be afraid
I won't hurt you
I won't come tomorrow
How can I write faster?
And what should we do?
I don't hold grudges
It's a driverless car
It's an autonomous car
It's a self-driving vehicle
It's really a shame!
I didn't know what to do next
Let's go back to the motel
Let's go back to the hotel
I hope it's not true
Please wake up at 7
Since it rained, I stayed home
It's part of my job
It's not worth the money
Firstly, we mustn't be selfish
Weather's pretty nice tonight
Is your family doing well?
She's looking at us
She's very unpredictable
It wasn't my idea
It wasn't her idea
It wasn't his idea
Stop drumming on the desk!
You're so cute together
She's getting ready
Can you rub my shoulders?
Can you rub my back?
I'm not interested in him
He's just a friend
He likes you!
She likes you!
I didn't know any of the songs
He's a friend of a friend
What other choice did I have?
It's a golden retriever
It's a Labrador retriever
It's not the first time
That's completely ridiculous
Why did this happen to me?
Why did you say this?
That's my reasoning
It's not my native language
I've never liked her
Are you freaking serious?
How can you even compare them?
That's not what I said
Why not both?
Are you fucking kidding me?
For me, they are the best
It's not their fault
I just haven't found it yet
Ew!
That's so gross!
That's gross!
It's a shame she's so gross
You're gross!
What is he talking about?
We're going to have a baby!
Did you see this man?
I'll be right there.
Tom, can you come tomorrow?
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Can you come tomorrow?
Do you understand Latin?
I walked 10 kilometers today
So you're a mercenary, right?
Yes, it's possible
Do you have a drug problem?
You can't make everyone happy
What the hell is it with you?
What the fuck is it with you?
I'm eating an apple
Two!
He's Tony
Did you get another cat?
And when are you going?
I can't forget Marika
Has Marika ever visited Japan?
Who was Marika?
Where did you meet Marika?
Did Marika speak Swedish?
Does Tom speak French?
Can Tom speak French?
Is Tom any good at French?
Did Marika read the Quran?
He's playing with his friends
She's playing with her friends
They're playing together
That doesn't change a thing
Do you see it?
Do you have a lot to do?
Are you headed towards me?
She's doing quite well
She's gentle and patient
Leave now!
Achoo!
Bless you!
Thanks.
How's your new job going?
Where is your brother?
I need to see him immediately!
Please, show me your photo
Am I a liar?
I've known you for years
I've never been to Oslo
Have you ever been to Boston?
Why should I believe you?
How are you called?
Who will give the party?
I'm going to work by bicycle
I'll take my car
How much money do you need?
Do you help me?
Have a nice sleep!
He's handsome and mysterious
Tom can't abide veggies
Can you do it alone?
Do you have any farm animals?
Must I always go through this?
Oh, that's ancient history!
What are you angry about?
What does the bill amount to?
What's your annual income?
Give me some sugar, too
I don't like this room
May I have another one?
Tom is hurt!
Call an ambulance!
Are you angry at him?

How do you tell them apart?
How long have you been away?
I can't answer this question
I didn't want to go anyway
I was awakened at five o'clock
I'm anxious to succeed
I'm not wide awake yet
Is there anything for me?
Is Tom awake yet?
It's thirty kilometers away
Where the fuck did the sun go?
Don't say bullshit!
Stop saying bullshit!
Who wrote this bullshit?
Why do you want to outcast me?
Sarcasm?

They'll make you hate yourself
First, I'd like to thank God
There's a lot of work to do
Marco!
Polo!
It's very dangerous
She won't listen to me
He won't listen to me
But will it be a problem?
It's like I always thought
I've never trusted Tom
You would abhor that!
Tonight I'm getting drunk!
You're spreading false news
And you?
My family's well
And how about all of yours?
We're definitely going
You?
Naturally.
Of course.
Holidays?
What are they?
He'll get sloppy
How beautiful we are!
That wouldn't be so stupid

Have you fed the horse?
Plants require CO2 to grow
He isn't married
He's not married
It's Monday and it's sunny
If you write, write correctly
Don't be peeved
Alright, let's try to do this
I'm afraid of bats
They've gone to buy a baseball
Where can I take a bath?
Today, I have other plans
And for what?
I'm not an expert
He's intelligent, but lazy
Well done!
That's not bad
Some are good, others bad
Ready?
Go!
I'm not a hipster
I'm looking for a place to eat
Do you have some lip balm?
She's an esthetician
She's stupid and greedy
He's greedy and stupid
She's easily influenced
She's materialistic and vain
She's nuts
Are you vegetarian?
What are you hiding from me?
It's like magic
He's been acting odd lately
She's been acting odd lately
It's just a rumor
No one likes you.
It's not true!
He's desperate
I am a fly!
How do I use this?
Are you still angry with me?
I'm not feeling like joking
Have you ordered?
Why do you hide your thoughts?
I don't want any money
I'll be back shortly
If you need help, just ask
Do you know this comic?
Do you know this cartoon?
Umm, I have a request..
Excuse me, I have a request
It's still a job
She works 9-5 every weekday
I don't live in Turin
You're a wanker
Why are you aggressive today?
Don't step in the flower bed
Haven't you begun yet?
I'll phone you before I start
I'll take roast beef
Let's begin with soup
Are you leaving today?
Being stubborn won't help you
They've been late every day
What became of them?
There's just one day left
There's only a day left
There's a day left
Don't be so harsh on yourself
My name's Tom
I'm from France.
Tom!
She's different
He's different
I don't want to have children
You can't do that to me!
You are mistaken!
Arabic is difficult!
Let's talk about your work
Okay, try again
I'll call you in the evening
He can't have said that
No, I saw it
It's true!
I don't care
I don't care
You mustn't tell anyone
Do you like mussels?
Did I see what I saw?
Should I tell the police?
I'm not gonna lie to you
It's not even true
Why did you cry so much?
It's hurting our children
Why this line?
He's a lucky guy
She's a lucky girl
I'm an ex-vegetarian
Is that all your small change?
It's bizarre
Do you have the source code?
Who invented bureaucracy?
That guy's really lazy
As far as I go, I'm a cook
It's no big deal if I lose
So what if I lost?
Everyone's different
Bathroom's free
I'd like some powidlo
Did you get a good look?
Let's call the police
Now I'm a real old man
Did he do this to you?
Did Tom do this to you?
Do you know this man's name?
Do you know this woman's name?
Do you know his last name?
It's been more than a month
Have you paid the rent?
Let's not fight among us
I'm going to drink some juice
How can we save the earth?
That's where my family is from
This :-) is an emoticon
It's one of my favorite dishes
Can I have one?
Good for you!
I didn't know that trick
That was the last drop!
I don't want to see you again!
She's not fat
You're too skinny!
Police!
Drop your weapon!
Black, of course.
What would Jesus do?
He's tall and lanky
We can't disappoint him!
Do you have a mental problem?
What are you thinking about???
Keep the faith alive!
Stop making fun of me!
You really kick ass!
Where is the key to this room?
He didn't buy it
We're just good friends
Did you sleep with him?
No, I did not sleep with him
No, I didn't sleep with him
Did you kiss him?
Did Tom kiss Mary?
She's a beautiful woman
You don't have to shout at me
Tom avoided Mary's eyes
Tom called you?
Tom can't walk on his own yet
Tom couldn't look at Mary
Tom didn't raise his voice
Tom didn't see a way out
Tom didn't take the hint
Tom hasn't turned up yet
Tom said he'd find her
Tom says he'll find her
Tom wasn't always there
I can't do anything at all!
Can I eat this bread?
There's no rest for the wicked
That, I don't know
They say he's gone for good
It's bad for your back
He doesn't see it that way
She doesn't see it that way
He's a rebel
It's the story of my life
It's their business
It's not the same anymore
My dad doesn't hate you
He knows what you're thinking
She knows what you're thinking
It doesn't taste very good
We don't have a lot in common
I didn't suspect anything
He didn't suspect anything
She didn't suspect anything
They didn't suspect anything
Put your guns down!
What did she do with it?
What did he do with it?
Do you have a calendar?
I'll buy the tickets tomorrow
Is that bag made of calfskin?
That's a good buy
The fire's blazing nicely now
Were there any calls for me?
What does the plan call for?
I'm coming to the car
Please, open your mouth!
Do I have your attention?
For what reason?
He's small for his age
She's interested in fashion
It's enough
What a cute outfit!
He's really cool looking
It's really cool looking
What else do you do?
I'm shopping for my girlfriend
I'm shopping for my boyfriend
Where are my leg warmers?
Where did you buy it?
It's you you the fallen angel
You don't have a life
Have you forgotten?
Where did you buy that?
I'm coming.
Oops, I think we forgot Tom
Oops, I did it again
I don't know the truth
He's a great scientist
Summer vacation?
I think we need to call 911
After a moment, Tom followed
After a moment, Tom joined him
After all, Tom was your father
I mean Jesus, Tom!
We don't know yet
Tom's name was on the list
Would you do that for me?
Tom can't hold his liquor
So... it was all his fault?
You should know that by now!
Did you draw it from memory?
Did you find your car-keys?
How can you doubt his word?
I couldn’t let it go
I just can’t picture that
I know what he’s capable of
I know what’s in your heart
I think I’m going to be okay
Tom bent over Mary's corpse
Tom couldn't talk me out of it
Tom didn't look back
Tom didn't want to die
Tom didn't want to starve
Tom doesn't like me much
Tom, where are we?
Bring me the phone, Tom
I don't ask questions
I'm gonna be in my room
I'm going to be in my room
I'm hopping a ride
I've been praying for this day
You've been screwing with them
I couldn't agree more
What's in it for you?
I think it's pretty cool
Get off my lawn!
We're not together anymore
They are both so lovely!
They were both so cute!
I honestly don't care
Show me what you're capable of
Show us what you're capable of
Share and spread the word!
That's what you do
Dry your tears, my child
You don't have to cry
My mom says I'm pretty
My mom says I'm smart
She's very impressionable
I'm pretty sure she's right
I'm pretty sure he's right
Wow, you look really beautiful
Do I look okay?
I will do anything you say!
Please don't take my life
What impressed you the most?
I don't know who to choose
They're both incredibly cute!
I choose you!
Tom, I choose you!
Pikachu is a Pokémon
Tom is not a Pokémon
I'm not very athletic
She's not very athletic
We broke up on Valentine's Day
She has no clue who she's with
She's lonely and unhappy
My dress is ruined!
Why are you wearing my dress?
That's my dress
What if I get caught?
What if we get caught?
She's jealous and possessive
I'm depending on your help
It is the steamed potato!
Can you justify your claim?
Could I look at that book?
Has Mary cleaned the room yet?
This plate isn't very clean
Tom can't read or write
When could you start working?
Send us your shadows!
How much does it cost him?
Use this!
Run for your lives!
Are you chapulling?
What if you get caught?
Do you have a paper clip?
May I come along with you?
What time is it by your clock?
She didn't even say thanks
I totally agree with you!
Can I kiss you?
Is it OK if I kiss you?
May I kiss you?
Take away these dishes, please
They don't accept volunteers
Don't leave me here alone
It's almost 11:30
He's Italian
Have you a dog?
What did you do today?
What did you say to the boys?
I can't trust people like him
Do you think it'll rain today?
Can I call you back?
This really isn't a good time
I can't right now
I'm going back to sleep
Wow, you're so lucky!
Hi honey, I'm home
Mr. Young is old
You know exactly what I mean!
Where did this come from?
I saw the pictures.
What pictures?
When did Mary buy this skirt?
What's come over you?
Who's in command of this unit?
Can I complement you?
You're just envious
Where is he now?
Where is she now?
That's a very naive question
It's my dream home
When will you be ready to go?

Has Tom always been fat?
Has Mary always been fat?
Do you known where Tom is?
I'm Tom!" replied Tom
Put that down!
He's like a big teddy bear
Hope doesn't feed our familes
And what is it?
Do you understand?
That is the place for me!
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?
How are you?
Be careful not to slip!
We are old, tired, and sick
I know that donkey!
What!
Do you like cats?
Bob will be back at 6 o'clock
You've given up smoking
I hear you've given up smoking
I hear you've quit smoking
I hear you've stopped smoking
I've always done it that way
Look!
A red and white mushroom!
It looks so tasty!
No, don't eat it
It's poisonous.
I've seen nobody except you
You idiot!
Look at what you've done!
Tom's work is sloppy
No one's in the bath
We don't trust Tom anymore
It wasn't my mistake
Peace and love..
How do you like our city?
That candle isn't white
Those candles aren't white
I don't speak Bosnian
The life of a human isn't easy
You didn't tell a joke
Your jokes aren't funny
Tom's health is improving
If Tom comes, please tell me
I can't follow Tom's logic
Tom's face lit up with joy
He isn't very good at math
Don't exceed the speed limit
Tom's bag was badly damaged
I think I'm sick
He's arrogant and selfish
He's an antihero
I'm not normal
He's useless
She's completely useless
What about Tom?
I've got no money left
He gave the go-ahead
There's a beach party tonight
I couldn't have said it better
The speed limit was 60 mph
No, that's a different story!
Shall we take a cab?
I never should've hired Tom
I wish I'd brought some snacks
Tom always thinks he's right
You should've been here
You should've left it to me
You're smarter than you look
Tom's smarter than Mary
Tom's smarter than we are
You must help him, quickly!
She gave the go-ahead
I'm so fed up of everything
Tom's sister's name is Mary
Apparently, that's not correct
You obviously don't understand
Does anybody have some news?
Is this your idea of fun?
My wife thinks I'm crazy
You're insane!
Hi, Tom
Why would you do that?
The keys, please
What are you doing in there?
Why do onions make you cry?
Don't quit
I've already paid the bill
Would you like one of these?
Would you like a cookie?
I thought you'd already left
We've already discussed that
We've already begun
Would you like another cookie?
He’ll say if he doesn’t agree
Who told you about this?
Where did you meet?
How is this dish made?
When did she go to Mongolia?
Did you meet in Seoul?
Did he write it with a pencil?
Did you just get here?
Did you see him in the park?
Did he get here last term?
We met in Xi'an
She graduated in 1996
Who does he play tennis with?
Oh, what?
You don't know?
Why doesn't she like me?
Why doesn't he like me?
Luka doesn't like me.
But Jonas likes you.
I don't care about Jonas!
Do you know why?
Do you know why?
She's an avid art collector
He's an avid art collector
He got his pilot's license
What an idiot he was!
Tom says he'll be a bit late
What an idiot she was!
Don't worry about them
Don't worry about him
Don't worry about her
I don't like cooking
I don't like to cook
Tom!
Get back to work!
I don't want to see him
I don't want to see her
That's what I said!
It's like it never happened
Hi, Tom!
Hi, Mary!
Don't mind him
Don't mind Tom
He's a little retarded
I'm eating my sandwich
She's a bit of a rebel
He's a bit of a rebel
She's a little rebel
Do you know Tom's blood type?
Let's register for that class
Can I register for that class?
At what time will I see you?
Can you put that into English?
Is it made of iron?
Is it necessary for us to go?
We'll investigate the matter
I'm talking to my friend
Write!
This box isn't so heavy
What country is Boston in?
What state is Boston in?
This knife isn't very sharp
Do you have a bike?
Do you have a motorcycle?
In some sense, you are right
We don't have all night
I've never been there
What is your favorite pastime?
Tom hasn't gone anywhere
He's still in his room
Do you like coffee?
When did Tom go to Boston?
Tom got to the station at 3:00
It's not even funny!
I'm too stupid for this world
I want a refund!
That's totally it!
Hi.
Hello.
What's up?
Nothing.
Who the heck is Tom?
Do you compost?
It was a very exciting day!
The accident wasn't his fault
It wasn't my fault," said Tom
But what do I see!
I spent 3000 yen on a new CD
How were the pyramids built?
You're standing on my foot!
It's disgusting
Are you feeling confident?
That's nothing, don't worry
Do you have a girlfriend, Tom?
If you drink, don't drive
If you drive, don't drink
I'm here to see Tom
I'll never disappoint you
I don't dare talk to her
I feel like playing, too
We could do with Tom's help
Could you work on him a bit?
We definitely need Tom's help
Listen to me!
Don't even think
We're in control here
That isn't a dog
It's him or me
Do you have pencils?
I can't even if I want to
Where's Benin?
Where's Boston?
Where is Benin?
You should've done it with us
It's always been like this
It's always been this way
I haven't seen Tom recently
Hi!
I'm going to pay
Capitalism can't be reformed
That's a secret
I don't like apples
She didn't give me anything
You've nothing to worry about
I'm not in love with anyone
I am hungry!
You are my best friend!
About how old am I?
Are you old enough to drive?
Have you had enough of me yet?
Tom doesn't study hard enough
Tom isn't good enough for you
You're old enough now
She's Miss Perfect
I've always loved plants
She's a ski instructor
I don't want to play with you!
I don't want to play with you!
You're not my friend!
Having a good time, old sport?
Seems I'm the only one
Sorry, old sport
I want some coffee, please
We're drinking tea and waiting
Don't eat me
She's a complete bitch
Last night, I read a book
It's 8:00 p.m
You'd have to expect that
When is Tom expected back?
What does Tom expect?
We're not expecting your help
We expected you at 2:30
I'm expecting a call from Tom
I was expecting you at 2:30
I should've expected that
I expect Tom back by 2:30
I expect to be back by 2:30
I didn't expect this
I didn't expect this result
I didn't expect that to happen
I didn't expect help
Are you expecting somebody?
You like chocolate, right?
You like chocolate, don't you?
Tom doesn't know French at all
You'll have to jack up the car
Don't judge Tom too harshly
That's just what I want
I'm no judge of art
Where is the judge?
She's on the honor roll
He's on the honor roll
She's a fashion designer
I, too, like candy
I like candy, too
Can you predict the future?
Tom's crying.
I know.
I'm so sorry
Are you okay?
Didn't you hear?
Oh, no!
What am I going to say to Tom?
I'm looking for my cat
He's a nice guy
No, I don't like him.
What's her problem?
What's his problem?
What's taking her so long?
She's been in there forever
What's taking him so long?
He's been in there forever
I'm being serious!
Come on, Tom
Come on!
Come on, you can do this
Just one more sentence!
What is her problem?
What is his problem?
There's no hot water left
My door's always open
What secret handshake?
So, what's your name?
Well done, Tom
We're moving in together
Piece of cake!
It's my very case!
They're married now
You're such a perv
When should I start?
He's a personal trainer
I haven't got any pen
You've already explained that
You're at home too?
You're home too?
Are you home, too?
Are you at home, too?
Why are you at home?
I'm in Tehran
Take a shower, now!
Did you hear?
She's going out with Tom!
I'm fine, thanks for asking
My life is over!
May I accompany you?
Never!
Of course, not.
I don't hate children!
I didn't know what else to say
I see you've got a new hat
Here's my membership card
Who do you like us to forgive?
Don't touch my daughter!
It seems that he's lying
Is a human being mortal?
Did you like the bicycle?
Go, give me
Esperanto is no one's property

Do you enjoy coffee?
I'll contribute soon
Go and be happy!
How can I be of use?
What's your favorite soda?
I'm in need of affection
Can you ski?

Who is this old dame?
Why are you looking for him?
What time do you wake up?
How did you make the decision?
Are you still dating Tom?
Are you still with Tom?
Are you still married to Tom?
Is that Guatemala?
Are you still dating Tom?
Tom!
Go outside and play!
What does BLT mean?
Tom?
What key is the symphony in?
We'll feed the kids first
May I keep this photograph?
Just what do you mean?
I've lost the key to my room
I'm thankful for your kindness
I'll be a bit late
I hope this horse doesn't kick
Do you know Tom by sight?
Did you hear a knock?
Can you untie this knot?
Keep on with what you're doing
Tom didn't know where to look
Tom didn't know where to start
I love you, honey
Why is my life so boring?
Do you know why?
No, why?
We can really win this!
Do you know if Tom is here?
A bottle of water, please
Morning!
What is its price?
You made it, Tom!
And now what?
Everything is solvable!
Don't speak to me that way!
Don't die!
She didn't say a word
Out!
I've already had two coffees
I think you're very cute
He's left me
She's left me
I'm leaving Tatoeba
This happened to me too!
Finally, I took leave of them
You're right
I should stop.
Do you want to go to the zoo?
Do you recognize me?
We are old friends.
When a man cries, he is strong
Shall we?
Did you have an affair?
Who wants to learn Polish?
She's very worried about you
He's very worried about you
Don't tell her I'm here
Don't tell him I'm here
He's either crazy or on drugs
I'll show you how it's done
He doesn't say what he thinks
What's the minimum salary?
I'm not eager to meet him
It's very cold, this winter!
Can I sleep on the couch?
I'm a good mother
I'm a good father
I've been wounded with a knife
How is it written?
I've spent a lot
Tom has money, but I don't
Tom is rich, but not me
You've worked more than I
A novel.
Is the seat high?
Do you see my brother's lamb?
Go to work, everyone
And you?
The same.
Where is your badge?
I suppose he'll come
What is in the backpack?
What a stench!
This lasagna is quite hot!
Do you see the big book?
Leave, please!
I'll read it when I'm able to
Neither entrance, nor exit
Did you listen to his message?
Do you want to win?
Poor cat!
Stop war!
Start love!
What do these words mean?
That's her home
May 5th is Children's Day
She hasn't paid Tom yet
He hasn't paid Tom yet
Did you ever try?
That's his home
Why not tomorrow?
Would you drink champagne?
Is there any problem here?
Did you know the dead man?
I'm confused
What am I going to do now?
I've come here before
I don't think so
What a trash!
He doesn't even listen to me
They don't look very happy
He doesn't look very happy
She doesn't look very happy
Poor Tom!
Oh my God, they're so cute!
Don't you worry
Why did you wake up?
He's wealthy and powerful
Let us do the first step!
Don't let them escape!
Look, this is a true story
Too bad!
What topics is she discussing?
I'm driving a car
Go, already!
They're not examples
There's no need to be afraid
Do you know a good film?
I'd like a fork
Where is Thessaloniki?
In Greece.
Don't tell the police anything
Yes, a button from a shirt.
No, a little further back
Tomorrow will be a holiday!
Awesome" is an overused word
His invention is brilliant!
Her invention is brilliant!
Where do I cook dinner?
Where do I cook supper?
Don't stay too long!
You're not as young as Tom
I love you Tom!
Have you ever had a wet dream?
Oh no!
February 12 is Darwin Day
They broke up, in the end
It was really bittersweet.
Oh my!
I've got anything
There's a puppet in the box
You want to vote?
That's not prudent
I'm certain, I saw him
I can't help you any further
You're smaller than Tom
Could you repeat that slower?
I didn't lose them
I'm no longer sleepy
How expensive!
Where is the woman?
You're breaking the law
So long, see you later
You are as stubborn as a mule!
My mind is made up!
What color are your nails?
Good night, my friends
For me, it's an obscene art
He's quite authoritative
Some people bring sadness..
I'm in good shape
I'm in fair shape
I wish!
If only that were true!
I've improved the sentence
Where is the book that I read?
I wasn't able to escape
My nails are blue-green
I don't amuse children
He's helped me willingly
Is there a white eggplant?
Does it surprise you?
Who am I?
I don't burn them
I don't understand them
I don't listen to them
I don't follow them
He's beginning to believe
If only it could rain gold!
What would the prince like?
That hut's floor is of bamboo
What are you asking for?
Can water intoxicate a person?
Why are they saying this?
I'm young, too
They won't waste time
Which flower did she smell?
Could it be urine?
I don't speak Arabic
Everyone say: "Hi Mary!
Say "hi" to Tom, everyone
She wouldn't even say hi to me
He wouldn't even say hi to me
Everyone, say hello to Tom
I'm tone-deaf
Is that car yours?
Tom, do you have your keys?
Why do people like golf?
I've got a little job for you
Have you ever eaten an insect?
I can't stand boiled onions!
What's a sentence?
To what shall I compare it?
What are you lying around for?
Tom's ties are always too loud
I can't help looking up to Tom
When will they start logging?
Doesn't that bolt seem loose?
Can't you lower your voice?
Are you at liberty to talk?
I've lost my purse again
I don't like Tom's looks
It's time for breakfast
It's too heavy to lift
I'm looking for a room
Where's the log house?
Do you have a license?
Who's that lame boy?
Don't lie on the damp grass
Don't stay away too long
Don't lose hope
Where have you been?
When do you close?
I think I'm getting sick
It's my ship
Did you want to speak with me?
I'm always tired
Are you still scared?
Does your head still ache?
May I begin?
Is it OK if we begin?
He's eight years old
It's 7:45
It's 9:15
I'm hungover
Mary tied Tom's shoes together
Do you want me to help?
It looks like it'll clear up
Are you a bachelor?
Those times aren't coming back
Can you send me a screenshot?
We'll see each other next week
Why didn't he come?
Weapons on the ground!
She's beautiful, isn't she?
Let's make for that tall tree
Look at the beautiful sunset!
How much do you make a month?
That's no reason to get mad
Who made the highest score?
Where can I buy a magazine?
I'd love to see this movie
The heat's driving me mad
Has anyone seen the major?
Where can I hire a maid?
Don't make me do that
What was your major?
What made Tom mad?
What made Tom angry?
What did you major in?
The heat's driving me crazy
Who got the highest score?
That's no reason to get angry
Let's head for that tall tree
3 times 5 is 15
That guy's incredible
That guy's amazing
Are they still mad?
Are they still angry?
Is he still angry?
Is she still angry?
Mary, I love you
What did you do at night?
She's eight years old
Why are you looking so sissy?
I'll write a book
I'll admit that
There's no knife
I'm not busy tonight
It's extremely cold today
Does truth begin in lies?
Don't ask me
She's better than me
She's more beautiful than me
I want to die!
I don't want to live with you
I'm busy doing homework
Mom, I'm hungry
We're talking about them
Can you e-mail it?
He's scared of dogs
He's a wealthy man
They know what's happening
You're a rock
You're Petrus
Don't lose time!
Hey you, shut your mouth!
It's neither milk nor whey
She's five
I'm going home next week
Where is the nearest bus stop?
It's too flashy
There's no sugar
Hear, O Israel!
I'm dissatisfied
I've never been to Istanbul
Are the hotels pricey?
And God said: Love!
What time is it in Sri Lanka?
Why isn't the WiFi working?
Can I get a receipt?
I'm scared of dogs
I'm tall
I, too, am a teacher
I'm also a teacher
Is there a bulk discount?
There's a little wind
How about some coffee?
Don't be like the rest of them
How do you make coffee?
Listen, Israel!
Lend me your pen, please
I'll lend you my book
I'm not trying to be lazy
What is happening there?
I'll return home tomorrow
You'll return home tomorrow
He'll return home tomorrow
She'll return home tomorrow
We'll return home tomorrow
They'll return home tomorrow
You don't have to be shy
Go vegan!
We've grown apart
I've finally come of age
I'm living in an adobe house
I'm lusting after him
We're age-mates
I'm lusting after her
I can't remember that now
It won't leave my head
Mary, I love you.
I know.
Sing me a song, Tom!
I'm tired
May I borrow a pen?
Won't you come with us?
Press ENTER, and voilà!
I'll go home at ten
I'll come home at ten
Who said what to whom?
He's over forty
She's seventeen
She's seventeen years old
I'm thirty now
Whisper in my ear, Mary
What do you say?
What do you say?
Plants breathe, too
Sing along with me, Mary!
I'm up
I can't get over my cold
Don't get steamed up
Watch your tongue, Mary!
Let's definitely do that
That's a big problem
I can hear Tom's voice
Gee whiz!
It's too salty
I'm from Denmark
The apple fell!
I love you, Tom
Tom hasn't paid Mary yet
Let's go to Boston together
Here's my number
Have a beautiful Sunday!
Does anybody recognize him?
I'm twenty-seven years old
Can we help you?
I'm happy for you two
What's better?
We'll be there anyway
Let's return to the hotel
It's awfully dangerous
It's really dangerous
I'll repair it now
What horrible weather!
We don't have any extra money
I know what I'm supposed to do
Give it time and you'll see
Why are you lying then?
I'll never learn some things
And that's the truth
I can't see a thing
No one will know this song!
But it's in the newspaper!
It's not completely impossible
But I wouldn't risk it
He's scared shitless
Normally, that should work
Thank you, my child
That's your car
You're very good-natured
What are your thoughts?
I've got a queen of hearts
Where do you live, exactly?
It's good to stay home
How's life going?
Does he speak Portuguese?
It's forbidden to do this here
We can't do this here
I don't work
What is man?
He'll win for sure
He'll come for sure
He'll come soon
He's not here yet
He isn't here yet
He came at about two o'clock
He's a close friend of mine
He's a heavy drinker
It seems that he's a student
He's friendly
It's very likely he'll come
Tom, look!
The squirrel is back!
I've been lonely, too
I can't wait to see you
I can't wait to see you
I have missed you so much!
I'm so glad you're home
I've missed you so much, Tom
I've missed you so much, Mary
I miss my boyfriend so much!
I'm going crazy!
I miss him so much!
It's okay to cry
I'm going crazy!
I miss her so much!
I miss my girlfriend so much!
I'm emotionally drained
I can't stand you sometimes
Have you been crying?
Yes, my eyes are all red.
What should I wear?
I can't believe Tom is gone
I just can't stop crying
I'm a dictator
I'm not a dictator
She's a graphic designer
What's up with that?
Will you do it for me?
Please don't be angry!
That's what I'm assuming
Who is Tom's girlfriend?
I've got one for you
He isn't able to understand it
I can't speak my mind
He can't read
He's unable to read
He isn't able to read
He's just like a baby
She's not talkative
She's scared of dogs
Don't go above five rubles
This material absorbs CO2
Not so fast, young man!
It's only $69!
It's only 69 €!
I don't understand it at all
I'm eighteen
He's a very strange person
Alessia can't speak English
She can't love you
May I accompany you home?
I want a new cellphone!
I want a new smartphone!
I don't think it looks bad
It's just not my style
Lol!
I'm cleaning out my closet
Why does makeup expire?
Tom Clancy passed away at 66
Poor Tom, I'm sorry for you
Love has never killed anyone.
Really?
Ask Romeo and Juliet.
Do you like IKEA furniture?
What is your favorite Pokémon?
Go to sleep Tom!
Go to sleep, Tom
Go to bed, Tom
He's relaxing at home
Can you understand French?
I just can't understand him!
Come here, friend
I'm sorry for disturbing you
Today is Tuesday, October 1st
He's a complicated boy
You're afraid
What country is it close to?
Close the window, please
Why is Facebook so famous?
What time shall I be there?
For now, no
They can't afford to be late
You can't afford to be late
There aren't so many gays here
I'm not joking
It's time to make up your mind
I'd like to buy a small mirror
I'll be back in three minutes
I meant to call, but I forgot
Are Tom and Mary man and wife?
Who manages this department?
Where can I get a good meal?
Is that bird male or female?
What does that poster mean?
Was this book meant for me?
Where's the men's room?
I can manage, thanks
What made you sick?
I'm not able to swim
I'm afraid of cats
I'm scared of cats
Does your stomach hurt?
It'll soon be sunset
Does God exist?
Words can't be taken back
I'll stay for a week
I'll call at seven
Oh no!
When will you come back home?
How much do these pants cost?
Tom, you traitor!
I'm drinking orange juice
You're drinking cherry juice
She's drinking apple juice
What is the man saying?
What is the woman saying?
Where is the cat sleeping?
What am I eating?
What happened after that?
Happy German Unity Day!
Are you deleting the comments?
What are you so worried about?
Why are you so worried?
He's a man with an iron will
Can you hand me that?
Are you scared of Tom?
Did you return Tom's books?
Was Tom killed?
She'll plant roses in a week
Who are the girl's parents?
She's a second grader
Don't make me wait
Do you think I am nuts?
You are incredibly naive!
Tom didn't go in right away
Tom didn't go straight in
Could you do me a big favor?
Could you do me a huge favor?
Could you do me a small favor?
You're making a huge mistake
I can't do this all on my own
I can't do this all by myself
It's very abused
It's very exploited
He's hurt!
Call an ambulance!
Get fucked!
He's a riot!
Don't poke the bear
I'm proud to be an Italian
It's an ambitious plan
Why do you look so sad today?
Sundays I don't go to school
What does the bill come to?
I'll be there
However, I might be late
Don't swear
That's a mistaken belief
Sorry, my mistake
Now you've got me all mixed up
Don't mix me up
If I'm late, don't wait for me
Why is your room pink, Tom?
What are you referring to?
What're you referring to?
She's my great-grandmother
In no way, stay in the ass
Keep still!
How was LA?
How was New York?
How was Los Angeles?
How was Boston?
It's one of my favorite books
I should confess in church!
Do you have a biro?
Do you have a ballpoint pen?
It's kind of distracting
Thanks Tom!
How many likes did you get?
Oh, my childhood was nice!
Many thanks for your effort!
Tom, you're not funny
I lost all my self-confidence
Why do we die?
Why are we born?
Tom went to an all-boys school
Do you not like Tom?
You dislike Tom, don't you?
Who deals the cards now?
Whose turn is it to deal?
Whose turn is it to drive?
Whose turn is it to pay?

You didn't ask.
Why didn't you tell us?

And that's how Mary met Tom

What's your favorite animal?

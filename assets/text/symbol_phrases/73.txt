He wasn't afraid of death
He wasn't able to swim
It wasn't your fault
Tom's teachers don't like him
You've got to change your life

I don't like blue towels
I really love this towel.
Keep it.
I really love this towel.
Keep it.
Oh, thank you!
How do you fold this towel?

This is Algiers.
This is home.
Tom's girlfriend is cute

He's now able to speak Berber
Berber.
Why?
Berber.
Why?
Because it's my mother tongue.

There's water in the glass
Really sorry, Mary!

We'd better disguise ourselves
Come on, I'll show you myself

Let's not sell ourselves short
I didn't express myself well
We're not ready to leave
It's time to defend ourselves
Frankly, I'm curious myself

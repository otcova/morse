Will the lockdown ever end?
How's your weekend going?
How was the rest of your week?
Get to it!
I guess you haven't met yet
I'll brew up some tea
Fingers crossed it'll be ok
Didn't you read the contract?
You got your bike?
It's slow going this week
Oh, I forgot to reply to you
It's enough for today
I've a bad head for names
Balderdash and piffle!
Oh Tom's into horse riding?
That's sheer brilliance!
Tom's a bit posh
Pep yourself up, woman!
They declared a truce, finally
Trying saying "No" some time
Say "Yes" to life
Let's call it quits
Just go home, seriously
Cripes!
A pox on you!
Fancy a pint?
School's been shut for months
Are you positive about that?
City or Rovers?
Please don't hang up
Normal humans don't need them
He who knows, rules
He's young but experienced
The laundry isn't dry yet
You're a very naughty boy
That's neither here nor there
He was a doctor for 40 years
Yanni's body was unearthed
I'm yearning to see you..
He'll finish in a second
It's time for me to eat
I don't like this shirt either
Let's play on the beach
That means it's healing
It's normal for wounds to itch
That means they're healing
Don't be such a chump!
Yanni has COVID-19
I don't like alcohol
You're going to be late
I'm the regional champion
You don't want to trip
Me neither!
You won't die of old age
I think it's not so bad
Tom, would you help me?
Me?
Are you out of your mind?
Of course not.
That isn't the plan right now
Tom's walk is like Jar Jar's
Who cooked?
Who cooked breakfast?
Who cooked dinner?
Who cooked supper?
Who made lunch?
Where's your store?
Where's your store located?
Where's your garage located?
Where's your garage?
Why's everyone laughing?
Why's everybody laughing?
What's you last name?
Let's never grow up
Are you tired yet?
How often do you eat pudding?
Next time, pay attention
Do they know what's going on?
I wish I had time!
It's written in Bengali
I can't give it to you now
They are really stupid!
Can I have a glass of juice?
I think we should leave now.
Me, too.
I have reasons to be nervous!
I want to kiss you so much..
Turn off the TV!
They don't look good
Tom, I came to say I'm sorry
I'm going to drink milk
They haven't fallen
Did everything go all right?
I'm Mary's friend
Obesity doesn't just happen
Does Tom swim?
Don't make it too spicy!
Don't make it too spicy
Of course, I've heard of it
Who teaches the third grade?
Are you still swimming?
Nice to meet you, Ellen
Do you have Spotify?
Tomorrow will be a new day!
Who directed this movie?
Is there an alternative?
Luckily, we have some savings
We're logical
May I try on this jacket?
May I try this jacket on?
I've drained the bathtub
Tom had money, and I didn't
I don't envy your life at all
Don't sit down
Where's the black cat?
He's still moving
That's what I'll have
Let's assume that's true
Let's assume that it's true
Let's assume it's true
Mary became a mother in 2013
Isn't it Tom's fault?
Don't believe what Tom says
I know when I've been insulted
This T-shirt is still damp
I've bought a new computer
You see that, don't you?
Where exactly are we going?
To Algiers.
I know something's wrong
This is Algiers, I presume.
Yes.
Here we are, finally
It's still quite humid outside
Who was Matoub Lounes?
Adrar" means mountain n Berber
The water is already knee-deep
Anymore questions?
He's still sleeping
Ijdi" means "sand" in Berber
OK, let's try this once more
Do you believe that it's easy?
Argentinian.
I'm as intrigued as you
Is it OK if I use your phone?
They've been to Switzerland
The children aren't in bed yet
We've run into a problem
Come on, let's be on our way
Where exactly is Boston?
Where exactly is Australia?
Do you speak Ido?
What's that on the plate?
Of course, you can come back
Of course, we'll do that
Their marriage won't last long
Can you sit in the back?
What are the side effects?
It's warmer than usual tonight
Keep aware!
That's an interesting point
That's how things were
This isn't for Tom
It's for Mary
I'm as intrigued as you are
I've heard Tom has left Mary
Scotch is Tom's favorite drink
Come on, Tom, drink up
Can you guess which one?
I'm driving tonight
I hope you're reliable
I hope that you're reliable
I've heard you're reliable
Let's eat, drink, and be merry
Tom drank out of Mary's cup
I saw Tom spiking Mary's drink
I'm beginning to feel drunk
I can't drink wine anymore
Mary watched, frowning
Did Tom drink beer?
Tom's father limps
Tom's father has a limp
What do you call this drink?
I've never drunk wine
Here, have another drink
Have a drink with me, Tom
That drink's mine
Tom drank Mary's coffee
Tom doesn't drink beer anymore

She's an awesome nurse
Does Tom drink tea every day?
I'm pleasantly drunk
Tom refreshed Mary's drink
Do you want something to eat?

Tom didn't drink wine
Is Tom really drinking milk?
You're my first love
His anger wasn't feigned
Let's drink smoothies
I should've read that book
I wish I'd read that book
I drank Tom's wine
Did Tom drink coffee?
Don't drink caffeinated drinks
Where's your restaurant?
Everyone's a translator
I don't know what to drink
It's upsetting
Don't eat or drink too quickly
Tom, let me get you a drink
What was Tom drinking?
It's my favorite drink
Order a drink for me, too
Order me a drink,too
Tom's favorite drink is water
What do you have to drink?
Did Tom drink wine?
Tell Tom that I don't drink
You shouldn't drink seawater
What fizzy drinks do you like?
Here's a drink for you
I'll be at home all afternoon
Why don't you drink it?
How many beers did Tom drink?
I guess the party's over
There's nothing left to drink
Tom wasn't really that drunk
Have you tried seitan?
We've been ordered to attack
Yanni didn't make it
Yanni didn't visit his mother
Yanni hasn't responded yet
Ah, him!
The cup is full!
Tom didn't enjoy the meal
Let's call off this attack
It's so good to see you!
I'm terrible with names
I'd like you to meet Karina
What even is a pomegranate?
We'd like your help doing that
We should be back before 2:30
Which button did you push?
Whose books are these?
They're Tom's.
Actually, maybe I can help you
That's not Tom's notebook
It's mine
OK, I hear you loud and clear
I can't decipher this message
That's not your notebook
It's Tom's
Perhaps I'll do that tomorrow
It's about time you let me out
Now he's a stand-up comedian
That isn't Tom's notebook
It's mine
Men don't ask me out anymore
That's our bus
That isn't your notebook
It's Tom's
Do all of you believe that?
The pool isn't open yet
We couldn't get the door open

Where do you like to study?
Has your study been published?
Don't disturb Tom
He's sleeping
Was Tom good?
Who asked Tom that question?
Who helps Tom?
Who needs Tom?
You're a cheapskate
Yanni's house was breathtaking
You're not lost
He's a clown.
You, too, Tom
Tom wished he'd studied harder
We're studying this trend
I don't understand your logic
What's the logic behind this?
That's a logical conclusion
Is salsa a fruit salad?
Is ketchup a liquid?
Is ketchup a syrup?
Doing that shouldn't be hard
Doing that won't be possible
The party hasn't started yet
Would you rather I stay?
Would you rather I stayed?
Tom missed us, I think

Do you like horror films?
You shouldn't be afraid of me

Why do you side against Tom?
Show me how you're doing that
This isn't where I usually sit
Don't kill Tom
I couldn't have done otherwise
Where did you put your shoes?
Why was the game called off?
You'll be able to speak French
It's OK to try again
You're always watching TV
Was Tom lying?
Look!
There's a cat in this kitchen
I doubt that it'll please Tom
I doubt it'll please Tom
What is a pomegranate?
It's still moving
It's very practical
This isn't normal at all
I can't let you have this
I'd really like to kiss you
Do you think it's a good deal?
That's where I have to go
I'm an archeologist
It can't be removed

I'll tell you what I want
Tom didn't eat dinner
Do you?
I'll scold Tom
Are you one of Tom's sons?
Are you trying to sell those?
Is Tom correct?
It won't be easy for you
I wonder who's responsible
Who turned the light off?
What do you call it in French?

You're on good terms with him
Threading a needle isn't easy
Tom admitted he'd taken bribes
Tom admitted he'd lied to Mary
This isn't a safe place to be
That's something we must avoid
Is Tom in love?
That's what you need to avoid
We're trying to avoid a fight
Tom's reaction shocked me
Do you know Georgina?
She's perfect!
How did you cook this soup?
Tom won't appreciate it anyway
They're adding fuel to fire
Is anyone in the bathroom?
Tom's chest is hurting
I can't stop eating
That's what Tom wants to avoid

Tom was sick, and so was Mary
Tom told me Mary wasn't sick
I'm sick of this song
I'm sick of hearing this song

That is reassuring.
He's a bad teacher
Marie's parents are rich
How much does this shirt cost?
I left Tom's house at 14:30
What is freedom of speech?
Both of Tom's parents survived
None of Tom's family survived
There's a mirror on the wall
I don't really want to, either
He's a real scumbag
What do we need to survive?
I've survived worse than that
I hope I'll survive this
Let's adapt!
Let's conform!
Incredibly, Tom survived
Stop reprimanding Tom!
Will it be Tom, or me?
She works even if she's tired
How did Tom survive that?
What is joy?
We don't need this to survive
May I kiss you now?
Tom wouldn't come in
I didn't finish the book
Tom won't survive on his own
I'm not sure Tom will survive
We can't swim
Tom won't survive this
I've never believed Tom
Tom could've prevented it
Could you take over for me?
Do you have a hernia?

It's written on his face
Will you start living here?
Did you already read this?
We're veterinarians
How is Mary's boss?
Is that person OK?
Do you like beef?
For some people, it is
It's our first class
It's our first lesson
He's disoriented
My lawyer didn't do his job
Easy, don't let it fall
We look like we're sick
I'll go in a moment
I'll leave in a moment
I'm the national champion
It's not like you're the boss
Let's get out of the house
I don't have initiative
They're building a wall
Who would know how to do it?
Wherever I go, I find friends
He's always liked women
Who fixed the window?
You're a really pretty girl
There's only a double bed
We're office workers
He's standing next to my house
How do I get to the bank?
I'm against doing it
Tom doesn't know how to add
Is she from here?
What subject did you choose?
What even is time?
We didn't win
Tell me what you've been up to
We're a lot like Tom

We'll wait up

We're homesick
That's a fairy tale
It's a tall tale
We're economists
How far is the nearest town?
I'm studying hanzi
Does it hurt when you pee?
We're all married men
When did the pain start?
How do you feel this morning?
Does what I said make sense?
How much will this cost me?
We're very impatient people
I'm less optimistic than you
Why did you come to my party?
I can't find my pruning shears
We're native French speakers
There isn't any running water
Today's going to be a hot day
Don't eat right before bedtime
I left my earmuffs at Tom's
He's the outlier
Don't let Tom eat any peanuts
Tom doesn't eat chocolate
Did Tom eat all his soup?
Let's eat early tonight
No, you're not a cat
What animals eat mosquitoes?
She's pitiless
He's pitiless
You're pitiless
He's greedy and pitiless
I didn't mean that at all
Why didn't Tom eat dinner?
You too, Tom?
Even you, Tom?
Et tu, Tom?
To lose weight, eat less
It's about synonymy
He'll be done right away
Don't eat just before bedtime
When did you get to school?
I'd really like to leave
My parents aren't home much
Tit for tat!
Where else can algae be found?
If I have time, I'll come
Go ahead, write!
Dogecoin to the moon!
When was your last haircut?
Will that cost extra?
Do you want a shave?
I want my hair shoulder-length
Let's forget this problem
That'll please my father
That'll make my father happy
Tom isn't going to eat with us
We'll be done soon
We'll be finished soon
We'll be finished in a second
That's far from adequate
We've already eaten everything
I'll take you there
I wasn't trying to hurt anyone
Tom is eating Mary's sandwich
I couldn't get out
It's become very warm
It's become very cold
It's become very hot
It's become very popular
It's become very interesting
What's a UFO?
Don't worry
Do you always eat like this?

We didn't pay
We're engineers
These grapes don't taste good
We're freelance journalists
I hate drama!
Men can't live without water
I'm Seminole
I don't like you.
Is it just?
Is that just?
Is it fair?
That's what the doctor said
We've got five cats
Is Tom sleeping or dead?
She married Tom, not me
Can you buy me an ice cream?
It doesn't work at all
OK, gramps
Stop, Tom
It's not funny anymore
Ew!
We're all married women
You're important
We're all gay except for Tom
Can you understand our French?
We'll be safe
More slowly, please
We're both thirteen
We're architecture students
We're undertakers
We're all golfers
When is Tom going to get here?
We're not dumb
We won't come
You'll end up on the gallows
Do you ever dream in French?
I don't find this interesting
We're all mothers
Everybody has flaws.
I don't.
Everyone has flaws.
I don't.
Turn on the light!
We'll do this
We couldn't stop smiling

We're thrifty people
We're all housewives
I wasn't there with Tom
We're nuns
If Tom can do it, so can I
We're all children of God
We're all God's children
We're all God's children.
I'm not.
You came here to swim, right?
We're looking for my book
We're hungover
I don't think it'll reach us
You see that black dot?
That's an airplane
That's what Tom wanted to say
There's pus
I'm putting my shoes on
Is it just the three of us?
Where did you go?
Tell Tom that I'm studying
We're just trying to have fun
I'm at the doctor's
You pervert!
The prison is this way, please
We're not lazy
I'll have to reset my password
I'm a student of engineering
I didn't dare look behind me
We got A's on the exam
I'll be there until seven
That's a hero
We're both thirteen years old
That's how I feel about it
We're all ambulance drivers
We're orthodontists
We're engineering students
We're off duty
We're smart people
We didn't cry
We're atheists
Tom's going to die
We're upstairs
Sorry, but we have orders
The storm didn't last long
We weren't mad
I'm Brazilian, and you?
We're expected
What an idiot I was!
Have you ever written to Tom?
When can I take a break?
We're actors
We're very patient people
I think I'm going crazy.
No, you aren't
We're honest people
It is in Tom's own interest
We won't fail
We're an hour late
My brother was a furry, too
Don't put out the fire
I'm also the most handsome
I'm starting to like it
I'm who works the best
For once, don't say anything
Do we have class this Friday?
I can't go outside
Rice doesn't contain gluten
It's an incurable disease
You don't need to pay anything
Today, dinner is on me
Is Tom having fun?
Who's whistling?
No one's going to believe it
Nobody's going to believe it
Do you speak Sinhalese?
I'm not afraid to lose
Tom doesn't want to lose face
I don't want to lose this job
It's tough to lose a loved one
We'd hate to lose you
How did Tom lose his job?
How can Tom lose?
Tom might've lost his way
We've lost a lot of customers
Don't lose your optimism
We're in a jam
Mary married Tom, not me
This isn't a hat
I'm putting on my shoes
That little kid is a hacker!
At last Tom's time came
Tom hasn't realized it yet
We're architects
There's a sock on the floor
Of course, we want to win
Tom might've read the letter
We're with Tom
We're still up
You'll paddle, right?
Is Tom finished?
I think it'll snow tonight
We're astronomers
Don't tell anyone what you did
We're interns
That's being done right now
We're amateurs
We're outcasts
We're undergrads
Don't let Tom suffer
We cried, too
Don't follow Tom's advice
We won't bite
She's very interested in chess
Is Tom friendly?
Are you Tom Jackson?
Who cleaned the living room?
Don't whine, do something!
Tom might've lied to me
Has Tom lost his mind?
Has Tom lost his mind?
Has he ever had it?
Let your soul turn to peace!
We're interpreters
They're still up
How long has it been raining?
I don't want them to hear it
Who are you waving at?
We're FBI agents
He'll snap soon
She'll snap soon
Do you love Mary?
Be quiet and start learning!
Don't let your memes be dreams
We're painting
Don't talk to her right now
Did you see?
Have you ever tasted paella?
I'm a video game programmer
It's written in Thai
We've never talked to them
Does she speak Polish too?
It's written in Galician
Do you have any idea?
It's written in Croatian
Who's shorter, Tom or Mary?

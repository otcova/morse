Sami was out, riding
Itâ€™s time to Let Girls Learn
How to say "please" in Wolof?
As a child, I was chubby
Can I push the button?
Cook the potatoes!
Brr!
I'm freezing!
Are you still tense?
I'm sorry
He's obviously lying!
She's obviously lying!
I'm not bored
I'm not shocked
I'm not so busy
I'm not depressed
I'm not a bit angry
I'm very happy today
I'm not tired tonight
I didn't like Tom's cooking
I'm not very impressed
I don't mind if Tom is late
Why can't we swim here?
I'm not very busy today
I'm not willing to help
I don't know what Tom needed
When can we go swimming?
I don't mind waiting for Tom
I don't think so, either
I wasn't scared at first
Tom is hoping he'll be hired
I'm not at all concerned
I didn't know what Tom needed
I didn't do that properly
I didn't mind waiting for Tom
I'm not totally convinced
I wasn't surprised to see Tom
Who told you I could swim?
I don't enjoy talking with Tom
I did that single-handedly
I'm in a strange mood today
How are things going at home?
That's just what was missing!
Do you need glasses to read?
What do you like to eat most?
Are you a baker?
What bad weather!
Here's to the holidays!
I detest that!
I dislike that!
I hate that!
We have to leave!
We must leave!
You're funny!
What are we drinking?
Watch me do it!
Where is my key?
Heavens, I'm lost!
You are really incorrigible!
You are hopeless!
These are all my occupations!
Are you hungry too?
What salary do you offer?
Tom goes to Mary's home
Where is my guitar?
Where is my saxophone?
Welcome to our city!
Do you know this woman?
Do you like to drink beer?
Where is the wheelbarrow?
Is it your son?
Why am I alone?
Why are you depressed?
She doesn't stop talking
Hi, Tom, where are you going?
Keep your hands on the car!
You've lost your head!
Have you seen my magazine?
What more do you need?
Sami liked Layla's video
Mary sleeps at Emma's home
Can you give an example?
I did that wrong, didn't I?
Tom is hoping they'll hire him
I didn't do that on my own
I didn't do that very long
I didn't do that willingly
I don't know who they were
I wasn't afraid to do that
I wasn't happy to be there
I'm not all that surprised
Who taught you how to surf?
I didn't do that in a hurry
I didn't do that last night
I don't care if I don't win
I don't mind if you're late
I wasn't a bit disappointed
I wasn't awake at that time
I wasn't through doing that
I wasn't used to doing that
Why aren't you swimming now?
I didn't get paid to do that
I didn't hesitate to do that
I didn't immediately do that
I didn't notice any problems
I don't mind waiting for you
I wasn't frightened at first
I wasn't having a lot of fun
I wasn't having any problems
I wasn't listening carefully
I've never been to a funeral
Who taught you how to juggle?
Who told you I couldn't swim?
I didn't do that very quickly
I didn't have any luck at all
I'm not any busier than usual
I'm not going to tell you why
I've done that more than once
I've never enjoyed doing that
I didn't do that the right way
Tom's eyes glowed with joy
Tom is kind-hearted
What does it mean to be happy?
What does it mean to be free?
Tom is bad-tempered
Tom is down-to-earth
Tom is fun-loving
Tom is laid-back
Tom is self-assured
Tom is self-confident
Tom is stand-offish
Tom is stuck-up
Tom is tight-fisted
Tom is warm-hearted
Do you enjoy cooking?
Do you enjoy shopping?
Do you enjoy watching sports?
Do you enjoy playing games?
Do you have your own bedroom?
Do you have any hobbies?
Who took my keys?
Sami was good-natured
Sami had sex with his ex-wife
Sami isn't making money yet
I didn't have to do that again
I didn't need to do that again
I don't mind sitting by myself
I don't need to do that either
I wasn't any busier than usual
I wasn't aware of the problems
I wasn't in a hurry to do that
I'm not really enjoying myself
That's what I need to find out
That's what I want to find out
Sami's cancer has returned
Where is my scooter?
Where is my kick scooter?
He's feathering his own nest
He is such a nonce!
This is what we could do:
I can't backtrack
Do you have a favorite color?
Do you have a favorite color?
If so, what is it?
Sami looked at Layla's fingers
How can you eat this much?
I'm hooked on that game
Sorry, did I wake you?
Sami watched Layla's video
That's not what I said I'd do
Can you move your ears?
No.
I don't like Tom much, either
Sami came to Layla's house
Tom doesn't have what he needs
At first I didn't believe him
At first I didn't believe her
I'm sorry
What if things don't work out?
We're safe for now
What's going to happen?
I don't know.
Why are you so insolent?
Why are you so fresh?
Could you explain it again?
Let's throw them out!
Get everyone together!
Where is Mary tonight?
Hello everyone!
Good morning!
Do you want to visit the city?
You want a beautiful horse?
Just kidding!
Everybody dance!
Do you have a handkerchief?
I'll talk it over with my dog
I don't have a cassette deck
How about six o'clock?
How about six?
Be sure to remember!
Funny!
Wow, so cold!
I'm going shopping!
That one!
Good idea!
Don't complain!
Don't speak!
Brr!
So cold!
Look!
An airplane!
Do you feel very weak?
It's all delicious!
I wish you good health!
Caution, dangerous dog!
I've returned!
Where is a pen?
What place?
Hello, Teacher Li
Is it hot today?
Goodbye, Anna!
Is Beijing hot?
You will regret it!
She's very obstinate
What's the dessert?
So beautiful!
Don't walk so quickly
I can't keep up with you
Are you Anna?
Mr. What's-his-name called me
If you wish, we can go there
I know it's terrible
How about a good massage?
I'm not a hard working person
I'm a level-headed person
I'm very sad tonight
Do you want cotton buds?
Tom said he doesn't do that
Which one do you want?
That one.
Which one did Tom give you?
That one.
Which one did Tom give you?
He gave me that one.
If you have to go, then go
Tom doesn't read much
Tom can't read very well
Tom doesn't read very often
Tom doesn't like reading
I'm not asking you, Tom
Which of those boys is Tom?
Tom wants to come, too
Tom says he wants to come, too
Was it just a dream?
Did you buy candles?
What are you doing here?
And what are you doing here?
Do you have the manual?
I didn't do that yesterday
I can't come now
Do you like drinking beer?
Are you sure everything is OK?
I'm already retired
Are you hungry, too?
I'd like to be a veterinarian
I'll buy the tickets
That's a serious accusation
I didn't know Tom was back
Let's make some more cookies
Why did Tom go?
Do you want more ice cream?
What was Tom up to?
This land is Tom's
I feel like I'm always rushed
Tom has a 3D printer
Silence at the table!
Are you even trying?
I thought he'd never leave
I thought she'd never leave
What is the point?
I'm hungry for potatoes
I'll have some cake
Are you selling your car?
You're upset for nothing
Hang on!
Didn't I see you yesterday?
How are we today?
Technically, I wasn't lying
I'm 99% sure
The dog's ears feel hot
I'm in the cellar
You'd be a great father
Don't forget to buy bread
Tom said that, too
I've agreed not to do that
Tom wouldn't agree
All Tom's jokes fell flat
I'm not at all interested
I'm not interested at all
Why isn't anyone swimming?
Why isn't anybody swimming?
Tom won't be caught
Tom won't buy bread
Tom won't come here
Tom worked part-time
I didn't do that yesterday
You're eating your orange
You aren't helping
He said "please take my place
It's been a few weeks
What in all the world is that?
Have you waited for me long?
Sami's dog needs a fur cut
You can't go beyond this door
I was 15 seconds over
We've been here for three days
He has a house in Chicago, too
Tom won't believe that
Do you go out a lot?
Tom wouldn't answer me
I've also done that
Do you enjoy dancing?
I've done that again
Do you still eat meat?
Do you watch TV a lot?
I've begun doing that
Are you still confused?
Do you still like jazz?
Do you still live here?
Tom, I must talk to you
I've done that as well
Do you live near a park?
Do you still have a dog?
I think I'd better be quiet
Who told you this nonsense?
I'm an engineering student
Do you think this makes sense?
Where did you guys find that?
Should we wait for it here?
Did you ask Tom for help?
Did Tom ask you for help?
Did you ask for help?
Did Tom ask for help?
You look like Tom's wife
Tom doesn't really like sports
How will all this end?
How was Tom able to help?
How much is all this?
We're going to call Tom
Tom doesn't think he'll cry
This isn't Tom's office
I know exactly what I'll do
Tom likes gluten-free noodles
Where is the German consulate?
I don't want to visit Tom
And, finally, Mary slapped Tom
We're out of figs
Your son is already five?
Somebody call an ambulance!
How do you spell "rhinoceros"?
Do you see the puppy?
Can you count to ten?
Let's go fly a kite
Let's go to the toy store
This dog isn't mine
Why is your dog limping?
Is your dog deaf?
So, you're not too bored?
Where's the justice?
Tom's a cokehead
How sweet!
Thanks!

What are you studying now?
Do you still do that a lot?
I've been known to do that
I've been sneezing all day
I've begun studying French
I've done that in the past
I've hardly ever done that
Tom won't get in your way
I've been hoping to do that
I've done that a lot lately
I've found a way to do that
Do you still like spicy food?
Tom wears a size 14 husky
I've always loved doing that
Tom won't enjoy doing that

Tom won't stop loving Mary
I've been the one doing that
I've been waiting to do that
I've just started doing that
I've advised Tom to do that
Do you still believe in magic?
I've been doing that too long
You aren't Canadian, are you?
Tom isn't a Canadian, is he?
You're Canadians, aren't you?
You're a Canadian, aren't you?
I don't speak Finnish
It is hot today!
Why are you scared of Tom?
Why is everyone afraid of Tom?
Why is everyone scared of Tom?
Tom was busy and I was, too
Tom was sleepy and I was, too
I've done that for many years
I've had no chance to do that
I've never actually done that
Tom won't be able to refuse
Where will you go next summer?
Tom won't likely trust Mary
Tom's rowboat capsized
Actually, I feel bad for Tom
Am I doing this wrong?
Am I doing this incorrectly?
Am I doing this the wrong way?
Can I have some coffee?
Is this too small?
It's made of wool
Let's go get them
Let's wake Tom up
Tell Tom I'm fine
Tell Tom I'm here
Tom can't hurt us
This is Tom's dish
It's too noisy here
Let's go somewhere else
Tom wouldn't murder anyone
Tom wouldn't hit anyone
There's a crack in this wall
There's a policeman outside
Tom said he wasn't cold
There's some water left
There's not much water left
I'm Tom's teacher
Are Tom and Mary optimistic?
I think I'll leave early today
Tom should've let Mary drive
I'm already quite busy
Why was Tom angry?
Tom isn't my partner
I'll update you later
How heavy is that box?
What day is the fair?
Don't touch that!
I started working here in 2013
I've already agreed to do that
Tom wouldn't accept my gift
I've already filed a complaint
Tom writes children's books
I've apologized for doing that
I've been learning how to swim
I've been told I can't do that
I've done that for a few years

Tom, I must tell you something
Silence!
Tom falls!
Tom paints!
Is Tom a witness?
We are busy, Tom
Hush!
He's sleeping
Tom hopes he won't be demoted
Tom hopes he won't be deported
He hugged Alice, too
He kissed Alice, too
He saw John, too
Tom wouldn't kill anybody
Tom wished he'd told Mary that
Why do you not like your job?
Don't be angry
What a big boy Tom is!
Hi," Tom said shyly
Sweat ran down Tom's back
Did Tom say when he'd come?
Tom is at Mary's home
Oh, shoot!
Tom can't afford to have a car
How to become rich?
What's your book about?
Let's get a chicken
It's not the alcohol
Do you think Tom can return?
Faster than a baby's yawn
Esperanto Man to the rescue!
It's Tom's book
It's in Europe
It's always with me
It's technically legal
I'll never drink again
If so, what do you play?
Who'll tell Tom?
Won't you sing?
I think I'll take that
I won't buy this shirt
I'll buy you something
I'll call the Jacksons
Sami looked at Layla's boobs
Sami's friends are gay
Sami wasn't even drinking
Sami is Farid's stage name
Sami is Farid's last name
Sami didn't see Layla at all
Tom's parents are both killers
No, this is not possible
Sami's stalker is in prison
Ken is tall, not me
He's a raving egomaniac
You asked for my opinion.
No, I didn't!
Tom's dog likes playing fetch
The sun beamed into Tom's eyes
You ask a lot, Tom
Thanks, Tom
Up leap / the waves to heaven
He hasn't got much upstairs
Picard is an oÃ¯l language

I haven't paid yet
So, who's the lucky one?
It's time Tom left
Make it short, Tom
I think it'll work
Tom can't fire you
I won't let you in
Tom didn't call me
I'd like some beer
I'd like some wine
I'm not a pacifist
I'm not so worried
It'll be safe here
It's a new bicycle
Leave me alone, OK?
Should I wait here?
Did you know Tom was adopted?
Did you know Tom was here?
I don't drink beer often
I don't drink wine often
I know that isn't the truth
I know you're not happy
I'll go tell everyone
I'm sure I'll see Tom again
I've already said I'll do that
I've been planning to do that
I've decided I'll do that
You aren't helping a lot
You're not helping a lot
You're shorter than me
You're shorter than I am
Should we help you?
They don't like us
I'll go get Tom now
I'll be back
I'm calling Tom now
What movie is this?

I'm sick of burgers
I'm sick of hamburgers
Are those Tom's children?
Which movie is this?
Sami doesn't know Layla's name
Sami wasn't expecting Layla
Sami took Layla's credit card
Sami was super-busy
Sami's heart fell
Aart joined ISIS in 2016
Come along!
Come home!
Sami got an e-mail from Google
Sami won't back down
Sami doesn't know how to hack
Sami hasn't done anything
Happy St. Patrick's Day!
Happy Paddy's Day!
How do I look?
You look beautiful.
Not much.
Not much.
Let's get cracking
He's got it bad
She's got it bad
Did Tom give Mary that?
Did Tom give that to Mary?
Don't let anyone see you
I know Tom isn't happy
Is this your helmet?
This isn't my knife
Who'll you vote for?
You aren't so smart
You won't find them
I ignored Tom's mistake
I like Tom's new jacket
I bet we'll have fun
I can't explain this
I can't get to sleep
I didn't impress them
I guess it'll change
Will you call Tom today?
I gave Tom Mary's address
I won't let Tom hurt Mary
I'll meet Tom next Monday

Will you help Tom do that?
I hope Tom doesn't find me

I think it'll be fun
I want an MP3 player
We've helped Tom many times
I'll buy you a watch
Is Tom really Mary's husband?
I'll find it for you
I'll let you explain
I'm interested in it
Tom won't be able to stop us
We can't change that
I didn't think Tom would come
You aren't my friend
I wish I'd called Tom earlier
You don't seem tired
I think I'm objective
I think I've finished
I think it won't work
I'll leave in October
I'll request a refund
I've changed my plans
I've requested asylum
Are your children here?
I can't help with that
I didn't attack anyone
I'm sure he won't mind
I'm sure she won't mind
I didn't burn anything
I don't have any bread
I'll stay home tonight
I've been beaten twice
Why is the table dirty?
Why was the train late?
You've disappointed us
I imagine you're hungry
Mary thinks so, too
I won't talk about that
I'd like some more rice
I've solved the mystery
I can't pay for it today
You've already said that
How do I roast termites?
What does the dog want?
Are you going to the concert?
I can't pay my rent today
I should've recognized it
I'll make some sandwiches

How are you doing tonight?
How are you going tonight?
Did Tom take his medicine?
Did you pass all your exams?
Have you already told Tom?
Do you like to study French?

Don't you still owe Tom money?
Don't you know what that is?
Do you still sing with Tom?
Have you already been there?
How did Tom become so rich?

How come Tom didn't do that?
Here's a pillow you can use
Have you talked to Tom today?
I can't make any exceptions
Has Tom discussed it with you?
Have you tried talking to Tom?
I'm sure we'll miss Tom a lot
I've dislocated my shoulder
You like cooking, don't you?
You like drawing, don't you?
You won't have any problems
You don't need to go with Tom
You've arrived just in time
Are you almost finished here?
Are you planning to go there?
Can I borrow this dictionary?
Could I ask another question?
Did you buy some nail polish?
I haven't met Tom's family yet
Did you empty the dishwasher?
Did you report what happened?
Did you start the dishwasher?

Didn't you know that already?
Didn't you make any mistakes?
Tom wasn't prepared to do that
Do you like cooking programs?
You must respect Tom's privacy

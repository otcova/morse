I wouldn't enjoy doing that
I wouldn't do that that way
Tom is the one who's crying
I won't eat at home tonight
I won't do that without you
I wish we'd left early, too
Tom is hoping we'll do that
I wasn't tempted to do that
Tom hasn't actually won yet
I thought I'd do that today
I think you're good-looking
I think you're going to win
I think you're a good coach
Tom doesn't want to eat now
I think I'd hate doing that
Tom doesn't think we'll win
Tom doesn't think he'll win
Tom doesn't think I can win
Tom doesn't care if you win
Tom didn't seem very scared
Tom didn't seem upset to me
Tom didn't seem too worried
Tom didn't seem to remember
Tom didn't seem to be ready
Tom didn't seem to be lying
I said I'll do that for you
Tom didn't seem to be bored
Tom didn't seem to be awake
Tom didn't seem to be alone
I promise I'll wait for you
Tom didn't seem tense to me
Tom didn't seem sad, did he?
Tom didn't seem intoxicated
Tom didn't seem happy to me
Tom didn't seem embarrassed
Tom didn't seem drunk to me
Tom didn't seem bored to me
Tom didn't seem a bit angry
Tom didn't need to go there
Tom didn't need to be there
Tom didn't look too worried
Tom didn't look tired to me
Tom didn't look happy to me
Tom didn't look broke to me
Tom didn't know who we were
I knew you wouldn't say yes
Tom didn't know where I was
I knew you wouldn't hurt me
Tom didn't have time to eat
I knew you wouldn't give up
Tom didn't have any enemies
I knew you wouldn't be late
Tom didn't have an umbrella
I knew you wouldn't be busy
I hear you've been promoted
I haven't painted for years
I haven't paid the fine yet
I haven't paid the bill yet
I haven't paid for that yet
I haven't had my dinner yet
Tom asked me if I'd do that
I haven't gone shopping yet
I haven't been to Australia
I haven't been feeling well
I haven't agreed to do that
Tom's house is in the city
Tom wouldn't talk about it
Tom wouldn't open the door
Tom wouldn't do that alone
Tom won't agree to do that
I don't want to change jobs
I don't think you're boring
I don't speak French either
I don't know how much it is
I don't care who kisses you
I didn't think you'd see us
Tom wasn't worried, either
I didn't know you'd show up
Tom wasn't wearing his hat
I didn't know you'd noticed
Tom wasn't very persuasive
I didn't know you'd do that
Tom wasn't very persistent
Tom wasn't looking at Mary
I didn't know I'd get fired

I didn't know I'd be lonely
Tom wasn't very diplomatic
I didn't do that my own way
Tom wasn't very dependable
I couldn't wait much longer
Tom wasn't very courageous
I couldn't sleep on the bus
Tom wasn't very busy today
I can't wait to talk to you
Tom wasn't very believable
I can't do that without you
Tom wasn't very aggressive
I can't believe we did that
Tom wasn't traveling alone
Tom wasn't told to do that
Tom wasn't the one who won
Tom wasn't ready to go yet
Tom wasn't quite ready yet
Tom wasn't expected to win
Tom wasn't easy to impress
Tom wasn't at home, was he?
How often do you wear a hat?
Tom wasn't able to help me
How much money did you need?
Tom wasn't a very nice guy
How much butter did you use?
Tom wasn't a religious man
How much beer should we buy?
Tom wasn't a model student
How many spoons do you need?
Tom wasn't a history major
How many donuts do you want?
How long did the storm last?
How long did the movie last?
How long a rope do you need?
How come you didn't do that?
Don't you have a dictionary?
Don't think I won't do that
Don't make me do that again
Do you want to do that, too?
Do you think you'll do that?
Do you think we can do that?
Tom told me you didn't win
Do you think French is easy?
Tom told me you didn't cry
Do you speak French at home?
Do you have to do that, too?
Tom told me that you'd win
Do you have a green sweater?
Do you feel like eating now?
Tom told me he'd walk home
Do we need to do that again?
Tom told me he'd try again
Did I give you enough money?
Tom told me he'd stay home
Can you do that on your own?
Tom told me he'd been sick
Can you buy a ticket for me?
Tom told me he'd been busy
Tom told me he wasn't sure
Are you still a taxi driver?
Tom told me he wasn't sick
You're not expected to win
You should've left earlier
You look like you're upset
You look like you're tense
You look like you're ready
You look like you're angry
You look like you're alone
You could've waited longer
Would I be able to do that?
Won't you stay for a while?
Why don't you do that, too?
Why don't we sing together?
Why can't you just do that?
Why can't we do that again?
Why are you doing that now?
Which do you think is best?
Tom told me he didn't know
Where's the subway station?
Where will you go tomorrow?
Tom told me I'd likely win
Where do you usually study?
Tom told me I couldn't win
Where do you intend to eat?
Where did you go on Monday?
When would you like to eat?
When will you do that next?
Tom should've slept longer
When does the museum close?
When do you plan on eating?
What will you eat tomorrow?
What programs do you watch?
What else needs to be done?
What did you do after that?
What did you buy yesterday?
What did you buy in Boston?
We've both never done that
We're not doing that today
We don't often leave early
We didn't do that together
This cloth isn't very good
This can't be used anymore
There's only one clean cup
There isn't much wine left
That's not how we did that
That's a famous restaurant
Please don't open the door
Our company isn't very big
Of course I didn't do that
Let's try to sing together
Let's meet at the hospital
Let's go shopping tomorrow
Let's do that by ourselves
Let's do that after school
Let's all do that together
Tom says that he won't win
It's really cold, isn't it?
Tom says that he won't cry
It's muggy today, isn't it?
Tom says that he can't win
It smells like it's rotten
Tom says he can't eat nuts
Tom said that he won't win
It looks like you're upset
It looks like you're tired
Tom said he's going to win
It looks like you're tense
Tom said he's glad you won
It looks like you're ready
Tom said he'd probably win
It looks like you're drunk
Tom said he'd go to church
It looks like you're bored
Tom said he wouldn't dance
It looks like you're angry
Is that an expensive watch?
Is it hard to speak French?
Is it all right to eat now?
If you want to go, you may
I've never been in a canoe
Tom needed to do that, too
I've found a job in Boston
Tom must've been horrified
I'm sure you can't do that
I'm sure somebody will cry
I'm still a French teacher
I'm sorry
I can't do that
Tom looks like he's scared
I'm sorry I didn't do that
Tom looks like he's lonely
I'm really glad I did that
Tom looks like he's hungry
I'm not afraid of your dog
Tom looks like he's asleep
I'm in no hurry to go home
Tom looks like he's amused
I'm hoping to go to Boston
Tom looks like he's afraid
I'm glad you waited for me
I'm glad I got there early
I'll have to do that alone
I'll do that if you insist
I'll buy you a ticket, too
Tom knows we can't do that
I'll be home all afternoon
Tom knows that I won't win
I'd rather not go with you
Tom knows I didn't do that
I'd prefer to stay at home
I'd never make you do that
Tom knew he'd have to wait
I'd never done that before
Tom isn't wrong about that
I'd never do that that way
Tom isn't very influential
I'd never agree to do that
Tom isn't the only witness
Tom isn't tall for his age
I'd be fired if I did that
Tom isn't living in Boston
I wouldn't let you do that
Tom isn't eating right now
I wouldn't let that happen
Tom isn't crying right now
Tom isn't a friend of mine
I won't sell my car to you
I wish we'd done that, too
I want to be ready by 2:30
I thought it wouldn't hurt
I think you're a great guy
I think you're a good cook
I think I've broken my leg
Tom hasn't stopped winning
I think I'd better eat now
Tom hasn't done that a lot
Tom hasn't been supportive
I plan to get home at 2:30
I never said I wouldn't go
Tom eats a lot, doesn't he?
Tom doesn't want me to win
Tom doesn't think I'll win
Tom didn't want us to come
Tom didn't want to be last
Tom didn't want me to stay
Tom didn't want any coffee
Tom didn't study yesterday
Tom didn't sound convinced
I knew you'd pass the exam

I haven't done my homework
Tom didn't seem optimistic
I haven't cried in a while
Tom didn't seem frustrated
Tom didn't seem frightened
Tom didn't play basketball
Tom didn't look frightened
I don't think you're ready
Tom didn't know who to ask
I don't think you're funny
Tom didn't know any better
I don't think that's yours
Tom didn't have a shirt on
I don't often see you here
Tom didn't even try to win
I don't intend to go there
Tom didn't even look at it
I don't eat meat every day
Tom didn't do that tonight
I didn't think you'd dance
Tom didn't do that so well
I didn't know I'd get hurt
Tom didn't do that in 2013
I didn't know I'd be first
Tom didn't do that himself
I didn't know I'd be early
Tom could've waited longer
I didn't do that on Monday
I didn't do that last year
Tom and I'll sing together
I can't get my car started
I can't get home by myself
Tom admits he's left early
I can hear people's voices
Tom's dog seemed friendly
Tom wouldn't swim with us
Tom would've liked to win
How much ice cream is left?
How much butter do you use?
Tom wasn't working for me
How far is it to the beach?
Tom wasn't wearing gloves
How do you do that exactly?
Tom wasn't wearing a suit
How did you come to Boston?
Tom wasn't wearing a mask
How about doing that later?
Tom wasn't walking slowly
Don't you feel like eating?
Tom wasn't very talkative
Don't sing that song again
Tom wasn't very organized
Don't drink too much water
Tom wasn't very observant
Do you want some cake, too?
Tom wasn't very dedicated
Do you prefer wine or beer?
Tom wasn't very courteous
Do you often work overtime?
Tom wasn't very confident
Do you have a pair of dice?
Tom wasn't very attentive
Do you eat bread every day?
Tom wasn't very ambitious
Do I need to do that again?
Tom wasn't really my type
Do I have to do that today?
Tom wasn't ready to leave
Did you buy this in Boston?
Tom wasn't doing anything
Couldn't you do that later?
Tom wasn't afraid to fail
Can you still ride a horse?
Tom wasn't able to escape
Can you still meet tonight?
Tom wasn't a student here
Can you still climb a tree?
Tom wasn't a good teacher
Can you do that in one day?
Tom wasn't a good swimmer
Are you still in the lobby?
Tom wasn't a good student
Are you still able to swim?
Are you good at doing that?
Are we allowed to eat here?
You've got to do that now
You'll do that too, right?
You'd better do that soon
You'd better do that fast
You look like you're sick
Tom wants to do that, too
You look like you're poor
You look like you're done
You look like you're cold
You know we can't do that
You know I didn't do that
You don't have to eat now
You can't wait any longer
Would you like to eat now?
Tom told me that he'd won
Would you do that with me?
Tom told me he'd call you
Why don't we eat together?
Tom told me he'd be there
Why does that even matter?
Tom told me he wasn't mad
Why does it matter to you?
Why does it matter anyhow?
Why do I have to eat this?
Why aren't you eating now?
Who told you that I snore?
Who do you think did that?
Who ate all the ice cream?
Where did you go swimming?
When do you intend to eat?
When are you going to eat?
What's your doctor's name?
What does that taste like?
What does that sound like?
What does that smell like?
Tom told me he didn't win
What did you use for bait?
Tom told me he didn't cry
What did you do last week?
Tom told me I'd never win
What are you grateful for?
What are you going to buy?
We've both got to do that
We're unlikely to do that
We're doing that together
We shouldn't do that here
We know you can't do that
We didn't travel together
This book isn't difficult
That's not why I did that
That wouldn't help either
That won't happen anymore
That isn't how I did that
Tom seemed sad, didn't he?
Tom says he's never cried
Tom says he'd love to win
Tom says he'd like to win
May I listen to the radio?
Let's sing together again
Tom says he doesn't snore
Let's buy the cheaper one
Tom said you wouldn't win
Tom said you wouldn't cry
It's up to you to do that
Tom said he'll try to win
It's cold today, isn't it?
Tom said he'll leave soon
It's been raining all day
Tom said he wouldn't wait
It looks like you're fine
It looks like you're done
It looks like you're cold
It looks like you're busy
It looks as if it'll rain
If you want to swim, swim
If you want to come, come
If it rains, I'll do that
Tom probably wouldn't cry
I've spent time in Boston
Tom probably didn't laugh
I've moved back to Boston
Tom probably couldn't win
I'm still teaching French
Tom ought to do that, too
I'm starting to get tired
I'm not scared to do that
Tom needs to do that, too
I'm not in Boston anymore
Tom must've been thrilled
I'm married to a Canadian
Tom must've been offended
I'm looking for my ticket
I'm in Boston on business
I'm headed back to Boston
I'm going to Boston today
I'm definitely not coming
Tom looks like he's upset
I'm coming back to Boston
Tom looks like he's tired
I'll go swimming tomorrow
Tom looks like he's tense
I'll get home next Monday
Tom looks like he's sorry
I'll do that if I have to
Tom looks like he's ready
I'll do that by all means
Tom looks like he's awake
I'll be thirty next month
Tom looks like he's angry
I'll be home this evening
Tom looks like he's alone
I'd rather come next week
Tom likes to do that at 2:30
I'd love to sing with you
I'd like to stay with you
Tom knows I can't do that
I'd like to eat spaghetti
Tom just wouldn't do that
I'd do that if I were you
Tom isn't worried, either
I'd do that if I knew how
Tom isn't wearing his hat
I wouldn't take that risk

Tom isn't a model student
I wasn't sure where to go
I was hoping I'd meet you
Tom is wearing flip-flops
I used to be good-looking
Tom is still good-looking
I think you're overweight
I think you're in trouble
I think you're disgusting
Tom hasn't stopped crying
I still can't fall asleep
Tom hasn't ever done that
Tom has told me he'll win
Tom has said he won't win
I should've waited longer
Tom has said he can't win
I moved to Boston in 2013
Tom doesn't write letters
Tom doesn't walk anywhere
Tom doesn't care who wins
Tom didn't want to go out
Tom didn't want any pizza
Tom didn't wait very long
Tom didn't sing very well
I knew you'd want to sing
Tom didn't seem very nice
I knew you wouldn't leave
Tom didn't seem too happy
I knew you wouldn't dance
Tom didn't seem to get it
I knew that you'd do that
Tom didn't seem to be shy
I hope you're sympathetic
Tom didn't seem to be sad
I hope you'll wait for us
Tom didn't seem satisfied
Tom didn't seem motivated
I hope you didn't do that
Tom didn't seem impatient

I haven't fed the dog yet
Tom didn't really love me
I haven't ever won a race
Tom didn't look too happy
I haven't been doing that
Tom didn't look impressed
Tom didn't look convinced
I guess you can't do that
Tom didn't have a bicycle
Tom didn't give up easily
Tom didn't do that
Tom didn't do that for us
Tom didn't do that for me
I don't think you're ugly
I don't think you're sick
Tom definitely didn't win
I don't recall doing that
Tom definitely didn't cry
I don't often leave early
I don't like eating alone
I don't know your address
Tom bet me I couldn't win
I don't have a skateboard
I don't feel like waiting
I don't care who you kiss
I don't care who did that
I don't care what you did
I didn't use to be so fat
Tom apparently didn't win
I didn't know it mattered
Tom apparently didn't cry
I didn't know I'd be late
I didn't know I'd be back
I didn't do that that way
Tom wouldn't let us sing
Tom wouldn't let me sing
I can't do that this week
Tom wouldn't kill anyone
I can't do that that fast
Tom wouldn't explain why
Tom would've let you win
How often do you eat rice?
Tom won't ever win again
How much are those grapes?
Tom won't be able to win
How many people will come?
Tom wishes he hadn't won
How many eggs do you want?
Tom wished he hadn't won
How many eggs did you buy?
How many chairs are there?
How many caps do you have?
How did you manage to win?
How did that all work out?
Tom wasn't welcomed back
How about eating together?
Tom wasn't wearing shoes
Don't worry
I'll do that
Tom wasn't wearing jeans
Don't turn off the lights
Tom wasn't wearing a tux
Does it matter what we do?
Tom wasn't wearing a tie

Tom wasn't very decisive
Can we afford to eat here?
Tom wasn't talking to me
Can I sing with you again?
Tom wasn't so busy today
Tom wasn't ready to quit
Tom wasn't in his office
Are you wearing new shoes?
Tom wasn't in any danger
Are you still the manager?
Tom wasn't hungry either
Are you still out of work?
Tom wasn't being careful
Are you still on vacation?

Are you still lying to me?
Tom wasn't a nice person
Are you still living here?
Tom wasn't a music major
Are you still a policeman?
Tom wasn't a good father
Are you guys ready to eat?
Tom wasn't a bit worried
You're not likely to win
Tom wasn't a bad student
You'd better leave early
You shouldn't sleep here
You should've left early
You look like you're sad
You look like you're mad
You look like you're hot
You can't sing very well
Would you please do that?
Tom told me he'd help me
Would you do that for us?
Tom told me he'd call me
Why wouldn't you do that?
Tom told me he'd be here
Why shouldn't I eat this?
Why don't you eat now?
Why does it matter to us?
Who did you want to kiss?
Which toothbrush is mine?
Where's the ladies' room?
Where do you usually eat?
Where do you plan to eat?
Where did you go fishing?
Where can we go swimming?
What's Boston famous for?
What does that look like?
What did that sound like?
What are you writing now?
Were you able to do that?
We're traveling together
We'll do that right away
Tom thinks you can't win
We shouldn't leave early
We know we can't do that
We just wouldn't do that
We don't want to eat now
We don't usually do that
This package isn't heavy
This isn't a post office
This fish can't be eaten
Sometimes I do that, too
Should we really do that?
Should I do that for you?
Tom said you're stubborn
Tom said he'd try to win
Tom said he'd likely win
Please don't go tomorrow
Please don't eat in here
Tom said I should've won
Tom probably won't laugh
My coat wasn't expensive
Tom must've been worried
May I write it in pencil?
Tom must've been shocked
May I write it in French?
Tom might've already won
May I use your lawnmower?
May I stay here with you?
Tom looks like he's sure
Let's stay at the Hilton
Tom looks like he's sick
Let's go hiking tomorrow
Tom looks like he's rich
It's up to us to do that
Tom looks like he's poor
It's too late to eat now

It's too cold to eat now
Tom looks like he's fine
It's time to get started
Tom looks like he's done
It's not us who did that
Tom looks like he's cold
It's been cloudy all day
Tom looks like he's busy
It wasn't cold yesterday
Tom knew he wouldn't win
It looks like you're shy
It looks like you're mad
Tom isn't working for me
Is this book interesting?
Tom isn't wide awake yet
Is that book interesting?
Tom isn't wearing a suit
I've promised to do that
Tom isn't waiting for us
I've done that both ways
Tom isn't waiting for me
I've brought you flowers
Tom isn't very different
I've already tried doing
Tom isn't in the country
I'm too tired to eat now
Tom isn't having any fun
I'm sure you can do that
Tom isn't doing that now
I'm sure I can't do that
Tom isn't crying anymore
I'm studying French, too
Tom is working part-time
I'm pretty bad at French
I'm not going to eat now
I'm not doing that alone
I'm also studying French
I'm a resident of Boston
I'll wait until tomorrow
I'll make you a sandwich
I'll just do that myself
I'll get back home today
I'll come again tomorrow
I'll buy a pair of shoes
I'll be happy to do that
I'll be doing that today
I'll be doing that later
I'd never try to do that
I'd never commit suicide
I'd like to drink coffee
I'd like to do that, too
Tom is hoping you'll win
I'd like to buy a camera
I won't do that with you
I won't do that that way
I wish you'd wait for us
I wish you'd stop crying
I wish you'd quit crying

Tom didn't have a hat on
I should've slept longer
Tom didn't eat breakfast
Tom didn't do that today
Tom didn't do that right
Tom didn't do that again
Tom didn't do that a lot
I know you can't do that
Tom definitely won't win
I knew you'd wait for us
Tom definitely won't cry
I knew you'd wait for me
I knew you wouldn't wait
Tom claims he didn't cry
I knew you wouldn't sing
I knew you wouldn't lose
Tom and I didn't do that
Tom always comes at 2:30
Tom's children are cute
Tom wouldn't go with us
I haven't done that much
Tom won't let you leave
I haven't cried recently
I haven't checked in yet

I didn't know you'd come
Tom wasn't funny either
I didn't go there by bus
Tom wasn't finished yet
I didn't do that for you
Tom wasn't drinking tea
I didn't buy any of them
Tom wasn't busy, was he?
I didn't borrow anything
Tom wasn't bothering me
Tom wasn't at the hotel
Tom wasn't at all upset
I can't wait to meet you
Tom wasn't always wrong
I can't possibly do that
Tom wasn't always right
I can't lie to you again
Tom wasn't afraid of us
I can't let you go alone
Tom wasn't afraid of me
I can't lend this to you
Tom wasn't able to walk
Tom wasn't a lumberjack
Tom wasn't a lieutenant
Tom wasn't a lazy child
I came to Boston in 2013
Tom wasn't a greedy man
Tom wasn't a good coach
How many apples are left?
Tom wasn't a good boxer
How fast can you do that?
Tom wasn't a good actor
Tom wasn't a bad person
Don't we have to do that?
Does this door open, too?
Do you want this anymore?
Do you need a flashlight?
Do you have a blue scarf?
Do you have a bigger one?
Do I have to do that now?
Did you see who did that?
Did you do that yourself?
Did you buy a dictionary?
Did you agree to do that?
Could you have done that?
Tom was hoping he'd win
Come on, you can do that
Can't you run any faster?
Can you still protect us?
Can we do that this week?
Tom usually doesn't win
Can I get you to help me?
Tom usually doesn't cry
Are you still in a hurry?
Are you still happy here?
Are you still feeling OK?
Are you still a bachelor?
Are you going to eat now?
Are you about to do that?
Tom told me he'd buy it
You've got to win today
You're doing that right
You look like you're OK
You can't do that again
Will I have time to eat?
Why wouldn't you listen?
Why do children do that?
Who told you I was rich?
Who else didn't do that?
Who did you want to hug?
Which one do you choose?
Which book did you read?
Where's your dictionary?
Where do they sell that?
Where did you go skiing?
When do you plan to eat?
What sort of book is it?
What kind of book is it?
What else did you write?
What does that refer to?
What does that all mean?
What did that look like?
We've got to go do that
We'll do that ourselves
We'd better leave early
We didn't sing together
Today is cold, isn't it?
That's not a dictionary
That isn't yours, is it?
That hat doesn't fit me
Tom says that he'll win
Should we do that again?
Should I really do that?
Tom said that he'd wait
Tom said he'd eat fruit
Please give me one, too
Please don't that again
Tom wasn't the one who died
Tom promised he'd wait
Tom probably didn't win
Tom probably didn't cry
May I do that right now?
Tom must've been hungry
May I borrow this chair?
Tom must've been asleep
Let's not eat right now
Tom might've left early
Let's do that right now
Let's all sing together
Tom looks like he's sad
Tom looks like he's mad
It's too hot to eat now
Tom looks like he's hot
It'll soon be Christmas
It wasn't hot yesterday
It looks like you're OK
Tom knew I wouldn't win
Is it OK not to do that?
Tom isn't wearing jeans
I've overstayed my visa
Tom isn't wearing a tux
I've never lived abroad
Tom isn't very generous
I've never eaten caviar
Tom isn't very diligent
I've got to leave early
Tom isn't a good father
I've actually done that
Tom isn't a gang member
I'm sorry I was so slow

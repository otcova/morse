Okay, I'm leaving
You've been culled
I can't afford a tombstone
I'm tired of being angry
Concentrate on the present!
What did you get out of it?
What did you make out of it?
What did you make from it?
She's going to be a teacher
She'll become a teacher
It's getting creepy
Guess who's coming to lunch
I'll let you guess
Suddenly, it all became clear
She'd like to become a teacher
He'd like to be a farmer
It's become commonplace
You're getting stronger
We're getting old and grey
We're growing old and grey
It just sort of happened.
Well, are you going to do it?
Well, are you doing it?
You couldn't drive very fast
Tom's not one for languages
Five euros for a cup of tea?
You're joking, aren't you?
Are you drinking water?
I'm going to buy a new house
How about you?
No, I'm not buying one.
I'm going to buy one of these
Maybe you should buy one, too
I would've done better than he
That's a sad sight
I'm learning Latvian
I'm speaking Estonian
We want only Tom, nobody else
Don't be sheeple
Tom isn't my friend
It's my stop
Together, we can stop this
I'm doing the best I can.
Oh, yeah?
Do better.
I won't teach Tom English
I'm not afraid of death
It's just a whim of yours
I'm a locksmith
What do you recommend I see?
What do you recommend I do?
What do you recommend I order?
Next week, I'll be busy
I won't sell my dignity
Call!
Talk to him!
Why's Tom so suspicious?
Your team not doing well?
They don't believe in God
A crocodile isn't an alligator
Do spiders fly?
Flies aren't dangerous
An owl isn't an insect
Which of the rabbits is white?
It's my turn to talk now
It's now your turn to talk
It won't help to complain
What'll you name the baby?
Does this zoo have raccoons?
Which bus goes downtown?
Are you all right?
Are you OK?
I love kittens!
Is there a bear in our house?
Maybe it's still early?
Is it still early?
We can't wait to arrive
They can't wait to arrive
We did not expect that!
What a miserable day!
Ah!
What a miserable day!
Get the hint?
Your boyfriend's wife hates me
Are y'all still in Florida?
Hold tight!
I want to hug you!
I don't see a big difference
“Mum, what’s a fireman?”
“You’re back late today.”
Could you show me the city?
I'll ask another way
Until next week!
Did you have a good week?
Do you want my card?
Do you want my WhatsApp?
I can't live without chocolate
I can't live with you
Tom became absent-minded
Tom has become absent-minded
Kiss me, love!
I get up every day around 7 am
Why don't you trust anyone?
Who reads these books?
It's what Dad wants.
My dog won't bite you
It's Tom they want to see
We haven't got a penny
I don't think she can hear us
She's recovering from flu
I've got the flu
Tom was executed 3 years ago
How much does this ring cost?
Run, before they find you
I ask, "Where are you from?
Ethiopia," she answers
It's Ziri
Is there a gas station nearby?
I don't have a favourite brand
I'll make a cup of coffee
Honestly, this is useless!
I'm unsure of the regularity
I don't know if he came or not
Let's jump right into it
You're looking for them
My dog's skin is spotted
Ha, ha!" he said in Spanish
I'm not tired at night
I'm glad that Tom quit here
I don't believe Tom's version
Better get preparing!
Who will be the victim?
You're blocking the TV
They don't believe in the Lord
Are they going fishing?
Heck of a woman!
Damn good woman!
Honestly, I don't know
Don't even try it
Is it egoistic to love?
It's all the same.
Why were you so curious?
Can you go check, please?
You don't need to stay here
That must've been a lot of fun
Can I see them?
I don't really want to see him
It hadn't been done before
There's no way out of here
We're trapped
I'm the oldest in my class
Didn't you go to bed, Marina?
Who's that girl?
They could be offended.
Does this city have Uber?
You know what I'm going to do?
Why is toilet paper sticky?
I'm glad that no one was hurt
Who will be the next victim?
Who will be Tom's next victim?
Who'll Tom's next victim be?
Who was the next in line?
Who's the next in line?
I'm trying to find my dog
That's an oboe, not a clarinet
We can't do that on Monday
What happened here last night?
Who will be the sacrifice?
You're a little shit
Let's not succumb the pressure
There's cobwebs in my drawers
I'm sweating like a pig
Don't force Tom into anything
Is this Tom's property too?
Kahane wasn't right
Is this Tom's property, too?
I'd rather go in Tom's car
Destroy the bourgeoisie!
Hallo," said the German
It's the upkeep
That looks like Tom's car
That looks like Tom's dog
Will the fighting never end?
Whose is it?
It's mine.
Mary isn't wearing makeup
Could you send it to Tom?
Whose is it?
It's Tom's.
Who is it?
It's Tom.
Tom's car isn't as old as ours
Tom isn't interested in me
When was this hospital built?
We will win!
Tom isn't as religious as Mary
You're gonna carry that weight
You call this art?
Does she have a shirt?
He's buying a shirt
Ask Tom what he'd like to do
Did Tom repair the watch?
Why didn't you come?
I wanted to avoid meeting Tom.
Don't send me back there
Tom hasn't been doing his best
Our team didn't win
Tom isn't perfect, you know
Here's your medicine
Why did Tom end up like that?
I took Tom's side
I won't let Tom separate us
Will Tom have to pay for it?
Tom isn't completely wrong
Free Hawaii!
It's terrorism
How old is Tatoeba?
Juice isn't food; it's a drink
I'm looking for my mobile
Did someone kidnap him?
I don't think so
I'm tired from reading
What sort of hats do you like?
Leave me alone!" he bellowed
Which one?
How many copies have you sold?
How many copies did you sell?
Do you fancy a game of cards?
There's meat in this soup
Is it a vegetarian restaurant?
Where is that anyway?
It doesn't seem funny to me
Tom isn't a good skipper
Should we have some tea?
Tom isn't in the cafeteria
Here's a blanket
Tom wasn't involved in that
I'll wash your car for you
Dare you disobey me?
How dare you disobey me!
Are you really from Australia?
Australia doesn't exist
Tom's high as a kite
Me, me, to me!
Pass the ball!
Up, up, I'm gonna score!
Goal!
I'll try not to forget
Everybody out, quickly!
Don't be silly
Are you listening to me?
What?
Yeah, yeah, keep talking.
I still don't know why
Let's sit on this bench
It's still too soon to say
What am I hearing?
You're the best!
What'd we do without you?
I've changed a lot, Charles
Don't you see?
Is my dad going to eat?
You can't win unless you try
I won't take another step
Maybe you dreamed it!
It's an easy language
Can I change the return date?
I'm a stoat
Because yes.
Are you crazy?
I'm just a car!
We'll continue to work on this
Get out, Tom
Tom won't be taking Mary home
This isn't water
It's kerosene
How much do they want?
Wait a moment!
Hold on a moment!
How many dogs does Tom have?
How many dogs has Tom got?
Isn't that bad?
Tom isn't concerned
I can't get it to work
This can't continue happening
Will Tom admit it?
Tom wasn't nice at all
How many toes do cats have?
I'll be visiting Boston
Tom isn't exempt
Cold weather's coming
Watch out!
A lorry's coming!
I like our picture!
Did you manage it?
Did you manage to do it?
He'll arrive soon
It'll arrive soon
He'll be here before long
It'll be here before long
They've already arrived
Did Tom agree to our terms?
I'm a welder at a car factory
I don't like shrimps much
You're not singing very well
You're not singing any more
Let's go skating tomorrow
The dog's name is John
Shall we sing a song for you?
So, are you and Tom...?
Are we what?
Oh, you know!
No, I don't know
Spit it out!
All right then: an item.
What?
Me and Tom?
Leave it out!
What makes you think that?
It's a long way to town
Did you have a backup plan?
Tom isn't going to be home
I don't want to waste my time
Is Tom really from Australia?
Tom says he'd rather stay home
We stayed at a five-star hotel
That was his mistake!
Did Tom get a receipt?
Tom isn't a cheater
Tom isn't even drunk
Tom isn't that thin
I hope that you're kidding
Do you have butter and beef?
You're like aunt Nedi
Why do you want to rent a bus?
How big are they?
Do you want some sugar?
He's drinking a litre of juice
They're grounded
She's grounded
Are you in North America?
Is Australia a continent?
We like strawberries so much!
How much is two plus one?
Tom wasn't upset at all
I hope that you'll be lucky
Are the two horses yours?
Who just came in?
This city's name is Arras
How far away is the ocean?
Did Tom get the job done?
I'm talking about our house
We'll purchase a hotel
We'll buy a hotel
When did he buy a hotel?
Somebody's at the back door
When did he purchase a hotel?
It's not a shrimp
Tom is a born-again vegan
Tom isn't living here anymore
Tom isn't that young, is he?
What, does the truth hurt?
Why did I even message him?
We'll need to help him
No, that's not what I said
Did Tom come today?
I'm going the other way
We've already had lunch
They can't get the upper hand
They can't take over
They'll do it tomorrow
Do you want to visit America?
Tom isn't a good man
For supper, I cooked spaghetti
Who's a little cutie pie?
You're such a disgusting mug
Did you see what Tom saw?
So, are you and Tom...?
Are we what?
Oh, you know!
No, I don't know
Spit it out!
Well, an item.
What?
Me and Tom?
Don't be daft!
What makes you think that?
We shouldn't wait for Tom
I'm sure I'm going to miss Tom
Tom isn't like his sister
Did Tom apologize?
I'll lie on the floor
Winning is what it's all about
Tom isn't going to do this
Tom isn't able to move
That's what we have to stop
Tom won't be leaving tonight
How can I sound more ladylike?
Who sent Tom here?
What does Tom not like?
I'd prefer not to do this now
What doesn't Tom like?
Why did you provoke Tom?
Tom isn't doing that yet
Don't trust Tom, trust me
Don't smoke here, Tom
It's our third win this year
What does it mean for Tom?
Did Tom brush his teeth?
It's hug time!
It's hugging time!
It's huggy time!
Why should I punish Tom?
For what?
We need to do that, too
Alex is a non-binary person
Tom isn't really dead
Don't you eat?
Don't be like him
Don't be like her
Let's not be like them
It's a real sensation
Where do we go after death?
No, I haven't tried it on yet
After supper, he went to sleep
I'm not doing this on purpose
Have respect!
What is strategy, really?
It was Tom's father decision
Tom isn't listening to you
I'd gladly go with you
Tom isn't Mary's husband
He's her brother
Leave, quickly!
If we win, it'd be great
Did you send Tom any money?
Does this price include meals?
Tom isn't excited
Have you got any ideas?
I can't think of anything
Have you got any ideas?
Where's your bag?
I've left it in the car.
Tom doesn't stay on topic
We could've seen it coming
They could've seen it coming
Where do you find the time?
Tom's back to winning ways
Why aren't you getting ready?
We're going for lunch
Tom isn't that good at skating
Tom isn't studying music
He's studying art
Tom isn't a fool, you know
Tom said he'd stay
It just didn't matter
It won't matter anyway
I'll do that, no matter what
It didn't really matter
Your age doesn't matter
Your age doesn't matter to us
It's a matter of concern
That didn't matter to Tom
That's a different matter
That didn't seem to matter
It didn't matter that much
It won't matter in the end
In the end, it didn't matter
It doesn't matter who you are
I can't let you in
Tom isn't over here
Are the questions important?
Hey, Ken, you got a minute?
I'm not paying for that
What was Tom arrested for?
Don't give them false hope
People don't understand
I give up!
There's nothing to worry about
Tom isn't coming tomorrow
Why do I need shoes?
I didn't need safety goggles
I didn't need safety glasses
Do I need an Algerian flag?
I didn't mean to make you wait
Do you like lollipops?
Where can I buy a shirt?
Step aside for a bit, please.
I can't stand him
A lot more could've been done
When is Tom going shopping?
Oh, I got a delivery notice
What did you buy at the mall?
Did Tom fail again?
It's a big win for me
Are you Sophia's parents?
Do animals eat it?
That's their map
Is the recipe hers?
Who has the menus?
Perhaps you're wrong
There's a mouse in our house
Get lost, Tom
Tom isn't Mary's father
He's her uncle
Tom wasn't at that meeting
Tom isn't a pilot yet
Tom isn't a fighter
How much did you make today?
Leave, please
Tom doesn't want to see you
I'm a wiggly worm
It was very dark, she said
Tom isn't a good planner
Tom isn't in his apartment
How did you recognise Tom?
What do you not understand?
What isn't clear to you?
There's a comma missing
Now that's just great
Did you fix your computer yet?
They need a book of Ukrainian?
Aw nuts!
Tom doesn't like asparagus
Something's wrong about this
Something's fishy about this
She's your mom, isn't she?
She's your mum, innit?
It's about five o'clock now
Tom's actual name isn't Tom
I'm off again
I'll make myself scarce again
Why are you pushing like that?
Was it easy?
I thought it would be easier.
We're closer to the solution
I didn't know the tune
Who benefits from it?
Who stands to benefit?
I'll do you that favour
What do you do?
You could say that.
Tom isn't an evil man
They've cleared off at last
Tom?
I thought you were dead.
I am.
The monster's name is Tom
Where does the sea come from?
They're trying to kill her
The platform's chock-a-block
There's a missing comma
Stop being annoying!
Stop rambling on!
Don't come here!
Poland can't into space
Did Tom propose to you?
Let me pass.
No can do, bro.
That's his alligator
Did Tom leave the group?
Bringing the big guns, huh?
I'm not afraid of you, pal
At least, it is not raining
Many non-Westerners live here
Do you want another blanket?
I'd like to buy one of these
Did Tom offer you a job?
Don't worry!
You've been an enormous help
I think it's worth a shot
Have you been burning plastic?
Have you finished moving?
Why did you bring your frinds?
You're pale
Is this your cousin?
You can't live alone
Move into Ziri's room
You can move into Ziri's room
Are you afraid to go to sleep?
You're a grown man
Do you feel lonely?
Do you want to visit Algiers?
Why are you being so clingy?
Are you busy on Thursday?
Don't meet up with Ziri at all
Don't reply to the message
Don't message Ziri back
You're really good-looking
You're a lot bigger than Ziri
You're idealistic
Tom isn't a fisherman
Don't use dating apps
You're simply stunning
Do you know that fellow?
You're so controlling
You're very masculine
Are you from our city?
You're a bit jealous
You're so cute to talk to
How would you like to die?
Block Ziri's number
Can you get Ziri to leave?
Tom wasn't wearing a watch
Tom isn't going to eat
I'm glad that Tom quit
I've never seen you with Tom
Leave this hive alone!
Tom wasn't talking to you
Why did he buy a map?
Tom isn't dating Mary, is he?
Be quiet, Tom
Can you inform them about it?
You don't need to go on a diet
When in doubt, hit it out
Tom isn't a minor anymore
He will buy Aali's luxury car
Shall I keep going?
Very well played!
Mary's husband is a redhead
Tom didn't choose us
Tom isn't that old, is he?
Did Tom say what happened?
Tom isn't a Christian
I'll wash your car
Tom isn't coming for sure
Is your luggage heavy?
Did you really grow up here?
Does it hurt if I touch here?
Tom isn't that guy's real name
There's barely any hope
You(m) have
Did Tom know who you were?
What's the time?
A little past noon.
What's the time?
A little past midnight.
They're heading my way
They're coming towards me
They're walking towards me
Where'll you be staying?
Where's Sophie going?
Where's Sophie off to?
Shall we go to the market?
Why do we need so much money?
Did Tom tell you the truth?
Did Tom tell Mary the truth?
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Tom isn't over thirty
We'd better plan for the worst
That was some game!
We'll finish the game tomorrow
It's morning in Japan now
Something's about to happen
Daniel is a fat, lazy slob
Tom has sickle-cell anaemia
Don't be fatuous, Tom
Hallo!
Did you hear that, Tom?
You doing good?
Yeah, I'm good
She's happy being a bi woman
Don't be stupid, Tom
That car's Tom's
Tom isn't coming tonight
How many cans are in a case?
You'll need to help him
I'm with Stupid
I don't like my appearance
Why are they still dirty?
You forgot to turn it on.
Maybe Tom doesn't like that
Tom isn't interested in this
Did Tom give a reason?
It's a matter of give and take
Don't be too literal
I'm not likely to get the job
I rest my case.
That really doesn't matter
By then, it won't even matter
Tom's lying
You're holding it wrong
Don't be childish, Tom
It really doesn't matter now
They're working together
Don't react too rashly
I don't censor anything
I'm not censoring anything
I don't know if you know
I don't know if you're aware
He's come to see me many times
What's happened here?
Stop scaring me!
Don't be so basic
Are you Romans?
Are they Romans?
Are they novels?
Everything else doesn't matter
I'm in my third period class
Are they Romanian?
I wasn't able to stay with Tom
He's working overtime
Is that how you say it?
That's the crucial question
You do love her, don't you?
I think that's it for today
It's just got to be done
Are you East Asian too?
I'm sorry
Who are you?
I've got some ice cream here
Do you want some?
Did he say anything else?
Where's the linen basket?
It doesn't matter who we play
Have you seen John?
Can I count on you to come?
Crikey, it's after midnight!
What's he going to call it?
Watch out that you don't trip
Mind you don't trip
Can you hear those footsteps?
Do you like jam?
Felix doesn't speak French
I'm happy I can help them
It doesn't matter what we say
I couldn't stay with Tom
Did you have them understand?
Let's see
Don't play dumb
Get up!
Today's the big day!
Do you think I could help you?
Who is she?
She is my mother.
It's all just nonsense
Art thou a hound or a rat?
Now it's just a matter of time
Oh no, oh no!
It can't be so!
Why must I wash the dishes?
Did you make them understand?
What will happen to Tom now?
That's enough
Make a fist, please
That's your favourite food?
Have you only just noticed?
Then, we discussed the Yucatan
Did Tom really do that?
I'm tired of being lied to
It's pure theater
It's a made-up controversy
Are you crying?
No!
You're clearly crying
Are you homesick?
No!
Then why are you crying?
It doesn't matter who you are
Don't tell me what I meant
Являлся" is a beautiful word
Can I talk to you now?
The comma must go, in any case
It's National Book Week
It doesn't matter where we are
Everybody, go home!
It doesn't matter where Tom is
Do I need a French dictionary?
I'm not hung up on him
I'd die if you left me
I'll die if you leave me
I'm sorry if I'm rude to you
I haven't done such a thing
Here's your Tom
Look at him!
Here's your Tom
Feast your eyes on him!
That won't matter in this case
Whose idea was this?
My idea is that it wasn't me.
It's just a matter of time now
Tom isn't from our school
That's the truth of the matter
It will be done, master
He's sharp-witted
This isn't a matter of choice
I'd like Tom to help us
So, I sat inside by the window
He's refusing to come
Don't be afraid to try that
OK, we'll try it your way
Let's try a little experiment
Tom won't try anything
I'm ready to try anything
Don't try to be funny with me
I didn't do anything different
That's disputed
That's being disputed
That's being contested
It doesn't matter what you say
Usually, Tom doesn't stay long
Why don't you go for a walk?
Julius's scrotum wasn't small
I wouldn't take it personally
Prove you're not a chicken
It's just a matter of how much
Tom said he couldn't stay long
How are you?
Pretty good, thanks.
I can't speak more loudly
I don't have a voice
Did Tom understand?
It doesn't matter how we know
I'm gonna make you cry!
Ziri did a U-turn
Oi you!
Get out of my sight!
I ain't that soft, y'know!
Why are you blocking me?
I told you to let me go!
I told you, go home!
I told you to wait!
I told you I don't need it!
Ziri didn't bring his card
You know what "hiss" means
You're a native speaker
Why are you leaving so early?
Why are you going so early?
With or without butter?
Game, set, match, Federer
Game, set, and match, Federer
Your past doesn't matter to me
It didn't particularly matter
I'd like Tom to do that for us
They won't surely like it
I'm giving you this
I'll try to be fair
Tom wasn't willing to try that
Tom wasn't trying to kill Mary
Maybe I'll try again next year
I'll try to stall them
Don't try to come after me
Did you try to do that?
Don't try to blame me for this
It's a matter of common sense
What is Tom eating?
Soup?
When the library opens?
It doesn't matter what I like
It's a plot
What is he doing?
Tom isn't ready for us
I'm going to ask it
Let's defy Tom together
Tom said he'd rather stay home
Don't make everything absolute
Can you prepare a solution?
Do you know the proportions?
She's my brother's wife
She's my sister-in-law
The night was pitch-black
Tom and I'll stay together
When did you get angry?
Why did you get angry?
I'm no longer angry at Tom
I'm not angry with Tom anymore
Mi faros ĝin poste hodiaŭ
That's the heart of the matter
They're brilliant kids
I'm used to tradition
I can't receive letters
I don't have email
Are you ready for the battle?
That means you're one of them
So, you like him too
So you like him too, do you?
Damn, this beat goes hard
Go to hell, all of you!
I couldn't get there in time
And?
Why not?
Do you want to learn German?
It looks like he's still alive
Tom and Mary aren't married
They're siblings
I'm awake, as it happens
I'm afraid I haven't booked
I have a boyfriend now.
Who's the lucky guy?
I don't know what to do
Ask you what?
If I'll marry you.
If you'll marry me?
You must've misheard me
That's not what we agreed
I haven't heard from him since
That's true, regrettably
It's snowing on the roads
Tom isn't a sell-out
There's something in the air
Are you convinced yet?
Do you need a briefing?
We can do that today.
He whispered, "Chaaha!
Which nuance was it?
Where did she buy these books?
It's a matter of pride now
They're brother and sister
Where do our dreams come from?
Don't blame others, Tom
I don't smoke at all
It's a matter of teamwork
When will she come?
It's a matter of time, really
Bring your A-game
Manners!
No matter what, I'll be there
Let's not wait for Tom
He won't come anyway
Tom won't be able to stay long
We'd better ask Tom
Well, maybe you should try it
I'd better see Tom
We're walking
My apartment key isn’t working
What did you want to change?
Switch off the phone, Sasha!
What's up with him?
There's a storm coming
I've spilt my juice.
It's so quiet here
Where are Jack and Francis?
Are you coming shopping?
Everywhere's closed now
It's a holiday, isn't it.
Ah, I'd completely forgotten.
He doesn't want to see that
I'd almost fallen asleep
It's like a hospital here
I fell asleep at 10 p.m
The night was pitch-dark
When's your next appointment?
What are your real intentions?
What's the F9 button for?
Do you feel anything?
It can't be done this way
Do you really love me?
Yes.
Over here, sir
I got fired.
Can you help me?
It's an ancient object
Whoa!
So can you help me or not?
Now I'll try something else
Well, it's worth a try, right?
They're smart kids
It's crucial that you do that
I wouldn't trust Tom
It's vital that you do that
Who's standing there?
That rumor can't be true
What's Tom in prison for?
It was Tom's decision
It's important that we try it
I can't handle Tom
Do you like apple butter?
Didn't I tell you to wait?
Love can't be forced
Are your suitcases heavy?
Don't put that in your mouth
That's what I'll try to do
It's something I wanted to try
No fair!
Tom didn't come up with that
Are you Romanian?
Are you guys Romanian?
I didn't bring Tom
Are Romanians Romans?
I wish I'd met Tom
That doesn't suit Tom
Tom's useless!
Tom is useless!
I'd like to travel to Belgium
I've asked Tom
Do spiders drink water?
I wish I'd seen Tom doing that
I'd love to see Tom
I didn't impress Tom
Who has the key?
Marco has it.
I won't go easy on Tom
What are you gonna do?
Just do it, fam
No to censorship!
Claude's mental age is ten
Felix isn't a cat
Perhaps that's for the best
Thanks for the laugh!

What if Tom doesn't agree?
We've already met everyone
Tom wasn't injured in the fall
Tom won't be here this evening
Tom won't be arriving tomorrow
This stain can't be removed
Tom wasn't the one in charge
Can coffee stains be removed?
What did you draw?
Tom wasn't holding Mary's hand
Did you and Tom talk about it?
Tom wasn't in time for the bus
You don't look like a killer
Don't call here again
Tom wasn't having a good time
He's pining for the fjords
Tom won't be walking Mary home
I don't like to talk about it
Tom wasn't warned to stay away
Open this jar for me, please
Will you open this jar for me?
Tom wasn't killed in the crash
What if Tom disagrees?
Tom wasn't alone on the island
Tom, are you with us?
I didn't like this museum
Tom wasn't wearing white socks
He's a songwriter
Tom won't tell Mary what to do
“Did you like the movie?”
“No, not at all.”
Tom wasn't the only one awake
Tom wasn't ordered to do that
How does paper absorb water?
How does paper absorb liquids?
How do towels absorb water?
Which materials absorb water?
She's singing in the rain
Why can't I come in?
I'll light the stove
Tom wasn't afraid, was he?
Will they close schools?
Let's return to this later
Tom wasn't wearing a brown hat
Tom won't be leaving on Monday
Tom won't be driving Mary home
Tom wasn't in high school then
What if there is no pandemic?
Don't sit on the steps
Tom wasn't the only one eating
Tom wasn't alone at the time
Tom wasn't the only one crying
I'm so thoughtless
I'm very inconsiderate
I'm very careless
Tom wasn't wearing his new hat
I'm not going to go anywhere
Tom wasn't supposed to do this
Why are you crying again?
Tom wasn't wearing a blue coat
I don't go anywhere anymore
He was bitten by John's dog
I haven't gone anywhere lately
Tom wasn't single at that time
Why wouldn't Tom visit Boston?
Why would Tom visit Boston?
What would Tom do in Boston?
I didn't visit Boston with Tom
Tom wasn't out late last night
Tom wasn't elected chairperson
Tom wasn't on duty at the time
I've already looked everywhere
Can I at least buy you dinner?
Tom wasn't hiding in the woods
Have you looked in the closet?
Tom wasn't trying to trick you
Have you looked in the box?
Tom wasn't one of the speakers
Did you look in the box?
I imagine you've heard by now
Tom wasn't hungry this morning
Tom wasn't wearing a straw hat
Tom wasn't hiding in the attic
Tom wasn't too busy to help us
Tom wasn't my French teacher
Tom wasn't a great teammate
Our tastes don't match
It's fun to work with you guys
Tom wasn't very well behaved
They're buying a baguette
Sorry!
I've forgotten your name
It's funny how things work out
Tom wasn't cleaning his room
It didn't really work for us
Tom wasn't drinking tequila
Tom wasn't there on business
A mother's work is never done
Tom wasn't able to speak
Who'll supervise Tom?
I don't walk to school
I speak fluent Berber, too
Women don't like that
A father's work is never done
Tom wasn't a medical student
Now it's time to eat
Tom wasn't playing football
Hi!
Tom wasn't about to do that
Where are all my files?
It's crazy how things work out
It's not a weird language
It's Berber.
Tom wasn't wearing a red cap
Both of us work 40-hour weeks
Tom won't ever let you do that
Do imams have days off?
I'm used to living on my own
Tom won't spend the night here
I don't like to fish either
Don't worry, I have a plan B
Who gives a shit?
This isn't a dating site
Don't give them money
Tom won't be going there alone
Tom wasn't sitting beside Mary
There's a bar at the hotel
It's probably important
Tom won't be afraid to do that
Will we learn how it happened?
Tom wasn't too tired to work
Did you clean the bathtub?
Tom won't be coming home today
That's the only way it'll work
It didn't cost us a cent
Tom won't be here Monday night
Tom wasn't the one who cried
Tom won't ever have to do that
Tom wasn't my violin teacher
May no one know my suffering!
Tom won't visit Mary in Boston
How is this supposed to work?
That belongs to me, not to Tom
Tom won't be difficult to beat
I can't let you go there
We can't let him win
Where's mom?
She's in the kitchen.
Tom won't be forced to do that
She didn't give me the letters
The mosque is closed 24/7
Tom wasn't the first to come
Yanni didn't enter the mosque
You said you'd marry me
We'll see each other tonight
I'm hidden in the pantry
Yanni is from Algiers, Algeria
Let's visit Algiers
Yanni wasn't in the mosque
Bring me my catalog, please
It's on the nightstand
Don't take toys to the mosque
That's not a word I'd ever use
What's that?
It's Skura screaming.
It wasn't an easy call
Mary was hanged, wasn't she?
We're all going to the mosque
The peanut butter is on sale!
My life is a cul-de-sac
Please don't say that again
He's coming with his wife
She's coming with her wife
We've got some very good news
We still don't really know
We're glad we did that
Here's a gun
Sir, are you ill?
How many stamps do you need?
I didn't want to hurt Tom
It was just self-defense
I'll be thirty minutes late
I'm not a squealer
Please don't use drugs
It's time to call it a day
It didn't use to be that way
We didn't talk about that
They'll never call me back
That man doesn't look kind
Why did he become angry?
She isn't alone in the house
Tom wasn't able to concentrate
My cat's fur is all matted
Don't use that tone with me
I'm a sophomore at Harvard
No matter you go, I'll follow
Wherever you go, I'll follow
Please don't buy it
You shouldn't buy that one
Please don't buy that
There's a large supermarket
I don't feel very well today
Don't sneak out of the concert
Sick chopped locks?
What's the Bayou State?
It's Louisiana.
It's Blida.
It's Bejaia.
It's Tizi-Ouzou.
It's hot.
Where is the cat?
My son doesn't speak Swedish
Tom was there, and so was Mary
Are you from Prague?
Was anybody at home?
Where is the rag?
Does your phone have battery?
Tom wasn't surprised, was he?
I don't know who to talk to
Did you get a call from Tom?
Tom wasn't calm, but Mary was
That isn't of much use
It's up to you how you use it
I'd advise you not to eat it
The cowboys' jeans
How much does Tom earn?
I'd advise you not to eat that
What are your skills?
I'm intelligent
Hold the elevator, please
Did they kiss anybody?
It's pretty cold outside today
Keep friendship with the bear!
But always have an ax ready!
We won't go on foot
Are they from another planet?
Tom didn't break everything
I didn't speak to everyone
I haven't spoken to everyone
I didn't talk to everyone
He who searches, finds
I'm glad I was here
It's worse that way
It's better this way
Didn't you throw up?
This isn't very big
We're eating beans
I wasn't bleeding
I didn't sing anything
We weren't studying
We didn't study
Uranus isn't a planet
Tom wasn't wearing blue jeans
Alison can't cook
Let's retry it
She's gone completely mad
She's gone completely nuts
That's not the tool I'd use
Write clearly, please
That's all Greek to me
Have you been out all night?
What's a lightning rod?
You fixed it all on your own!
Are they laughing at us?
Are you laughing at us?
What TV games do you all have?
Are you a teacher?
Yes!
So, she kissed you?
So, he kissed you?
There's no napkin here
God bless her!
I'll clarify now
That's not the word I'd use
Do they know each other?
Now that's what I call style
Can you get out of this?
I'm singing for you
They didn't call me back
It's not very often we do this
Yanni ruffled the kid's hair
Yanni is clean-shaven
Yanni is neat and clean-shaven
What's on Yanni's plate?
They have similar tattoos.
They're in a gang.
Yanni didn't really listen
Hey, mister!
What is that, by the way?
It's couscous.
Algerians do that, too
Do Algerians eat dinner late?
They're talking about Algeria
Algeria's flag is interesting
Algeria doesn't have glaciers
Your magic won't work here
Tom won't ever let me do that
I'd like to be called Yanni
My name is Yanni, not Yan
I'm going to bed.
Good.
I'm going to bed.
Fine.
I hate you!
Me too!
Mom, I hate you!
Thank you!
I've bought Yanni some pizza.
But Yanni hates pizza.
Tom probably won't be punished
Yanni's pizza is terrific
Please don't call Tom an idiot
I'll be here waiting
Tom's a vampire
Perhaps God is gay?
What is the fucking plan B?
When could we meet?
Maybe I'll just call my lawyer
Tom's a ghost
I think Tom's a ghost
He's lagging behind in science
If that doesn't work, call me
We won't do it if Tom leaves
People don't know who to call
Tom isn't alone in the cave
Who cuts your hair?
To hell with neutrality!
Tom isn't alone in the house
I laugh at Janeiro!
Don't create fear and panic
Do you dare to contradict me?
Tom isn't a capitalist
Tom's not a capitalist
Could I be wrong?
Is it possible that I'm wrong?
Is it possible I'm wrong?
I'm going to drag you!
Attention, everyone!
That is all... thank you
My brain is fried!
Obviously, we have work to do
I hope you're not serious
Should I call you tomorrow?
What should I clean now?
The more, the merrier!
What are some of your hobbies?
Who knew?
I didn't know who'd done this
They don't hear us
It's back-breaking work
That's how the saying goes
I lost my I.D
At first, I was a bit confused
I have spoken!
Oh lord!
Not long after, we broke up
Not long after, they broke up
They're classmates
May I say something else?
Get back to work, all of you
When and where is the party?
Let's go to the fair
Let's go to the circus
Some of them work, some don't
I think that's very important
We're against that
Oh, let me go!
I, too, am a daughter of God!
I think Tom's a cop
I think Tom's a copper
I don't know how much it costs
Well, yes
Tom was in a pitiful state.
Ohio?
What?
Was it Ohio?
I'll call her back later
We didn't agree on anything
I was born into a deadly cult!
Are you paying for the taxi?
What is on the tree?
I hope that you're not serious
Can Tom and Mary speak French?
I'll find a way to use it
I'll find a way to use them
We'll find a way to use them
Tom probably won't still be up
Paint, please
Tom probably won't be offended
Can you wait here, please?
Work like you mean it!
The video is incredible!
Could you please wait here?
Tom won't get a chance to help
Tom wasn't sitting with Mary
Tom probably won't arrive soon
Tom won't visit Mary next week
You didn't like this hotel?
I'm Algerian and British
Tom was a shoo-in for the race
We don't ever talk about that
If yes yes, If not no
Tom wasn't wearing a black hat
You'll have to work quickly
Tom probably won't come by cab
Tom wasn't invited to Boston
Tom won't need any more money
Tom, let me do it
Let me do it, Tom
Grown-ups love figures
Tom definitely won't cooperate
Tom wasn't sitting next to me
Why is it good?
I don't do this often
Are you Muslim?
Yes.
Where is the nearest mosque?
Is Yanni Muslim?
What can I say?
I'm a scoundrel
In 2004, Yanni accepted Islam
I can't sleep when I sweat
Tom wasn't very nice to Mary
Tom won't ever change his mind
How often do you bathe?
Get back to work, you bums
I think I've had chickenpox
Everything's horrible
Tom probably won't wait for us
You stink severely!
Tom won't be the one in charge
Tom wasn't my first boyfriend
Does it hurt when I do that?
Does it hurt when you do that?
Does it hurt when I do this?
Tom won't play tennis tomorrow
I'll get you an icepack
Tom wasn't the first to speak
He didn't understand her joke
She hasn't yet heard the news
I owe her money!
Spanker?
I don't even know her!
Tom probably won't be prepared
How much did you earn?
Tom won't leave this afternoon
Canadian.
Yanni didn't speak much Berber
It's too much for me
That's just supposition
There's plenty to eat
Tom won't be impressed by that
Are you're ready to talk?
Tom probably won't be arrested
Yanni's house is total crap
I don't believe you're guilty
Tom wasn't wearing a T-shirt
How's everything?
Horrible.
The tom's name is Tom
This isn't a time to give up
It's a quid pro quo
I can't just call in sick
How will Tom do it?
How old is he?
How many siblings has he?
How much does he weigh?
How much does his father make?
Tom won't give us what we need
He just didn't want to live on
Does he hear when you speak?
I thought they'd give up
We're based in Algeria
Tom won't win, I'm pretty sure
I'm talking about your stocks
We don't understand English
Can she play the piano?
It's too soon to give up
Tom wasn't alone in the house
I thought that they'd give up
We'll consider your proposal
Tom won't go skiing by himself
Tom wasn't eating by himself
Have you seen the budgie?
Tom won't be back this evening
Let's kiss.
Let's go somewhere private.
I want to kiss you.
Let's go somewhere private.
I want to kiss you.
Yanni is Skura's worst enemy
Let's go trick-or-treating
Yanni's teeth were yellow
How about a kiss?
I'm not that kind of girl.
I'm very happy to be alive
Tom won't visit Mary on Monday
I'm closing up
I'm still planning to be there
Don't make the suspense last
It's unlikely to happen
I'm very different
I'm still too young
Could Tom do this?
Yes, mister deputy!
I'm very grateful
Tom won't give us what we want
I'm very interested
I'm still investigating
Can Tom do it today?
The tomcat's name is Tom
Yanni's Berber was perfect
I'm still confused about that
I'm very satisfied with it
Yanni's Quran was gone
Yanni's Quran was missing
What is the name of this book?
The Quran.
Yanni couldn't teach Berber
I'm very nervous about that
I'm very concerned about that
Tom wasn't surprised by this
I'm still a little confused
I'm still too young to drink
Tom won't be driving to Boston
What does she eat for lunch?
I'm still figuring it out
What does she really think?
Tom did it, too
I'm downsizing
Tom did 90 percent of the work
Tom did 90% of the work
Tom wasn't shot by a policeman
Tom wasn't rude to anyone
I'm still active
I'm still a long way from home
I'm very particular
Tom won't stay, but Mary will
Let's explore Algiers
Let's go to Algiers
Yanni doesn't speak any Berber
Here, people speak Berber
That didn't really surprise me
Yanni's father is Algerian
Yanni's mom is from Algeria
Where are we now?
Algiers.
Tom wasn't able to stand up
It's a three-digit number
Don't put any more on it
Tell me when I'm wrong
Excuse me for being vulgar.
It's OK.
Let's go visit Algiers
I'm going to have to help Tom
I won't ask you for anything
Can Tom play the piano?
Which way does the Earth turn?
Right or left?
Algiers' population tripled
Algiers is a fast-growing city
It didn't need to be that way
Does Tom do it?
You know the address?
Long live Algeria!
I got myself into a mess!
We've lost
Is he Russian?
On Friday, Algiers is empty
Algiers is a fast-moving town
Yanni's wife is from Algeria
Here's what you need to do
We didn't expect that at all
Can I have a sip?
It's a cloudy day in Algiers
Where do you wish to go?
That's what we need right now
Tom, leave the dog alone
I'm going to be working late
Tom, leave the cat alone
I don't think Tom's an alien
How can I be sure?
We'll go in
What are you studying?
French.
What are you studying?
I'm studying French.
I'm studying French.
Tom told me it didn't matter
What'll Tom say about this?
You don't need to do it
I'm going to Tom's party
That's what we need down here
We're not OK
You can't miss it
What other songs can you sing?
We're eating
Why do you want to know it?
Do you have lager?
Let's go roller skating
Kudos!
A picture is worth 1000 words
Don't cry over spilt milk
Don't give up your day job
Tom didn't give any specifics
I'm going to fix that tomorrow
We want some beer!
We're healthy
That's what you need to do
Tom, leave my stuff alone
I'm going to lose everything
I'm going to stay in Boston
Yanni is half-Algerian
We're old
We're unhurt
I've seen Tom do it
You look like shit.
I know.
Go take a shower.
I wanna take a dump.
Use the bucket.
I smell shit.
It's Yanni's dog.
That's news to them
I'm Belgian, and you?
Did he write to him?
Don't smoke at work
I'm French, and you?
One is red, the other is white
Let's go to the party!
If Tom goes, I'll go too
Will Tom be penalized?
This CD costs 10 dollar
Don't come until I tell you to
Here, take an aspirin
They say I'm an old woman
Let's sing a song in English
Excuse me, can you repeat?
The movie starts at 10 o'clock
That's why we're here today.”
I'm going to move to Boston
Here's what you need to know
Let's give Tom a choice
We're blind
I'm not going to follow you
We left Boston at 2:30
Which one do you need?
Tom wasn't wearing a raincoat
Tell Tom I've broken my leg
It doesn't need to be changed
Why are you making us do this?
You're not young anymore
I dance, but not very well
Is it OK if I come, too?
Yanni's life was going great
Yanni's death hit Skura hard
I'm running down the road
Please tell me why you're here
What does Tom live on?
Fuck you, Fool Muttonhead
Did Tom do it alone?
That's all I really need
If they need me, I'll be here
Don't you want some company?
I'm not a prostitute.
We're mad
Which of you speak Hungarian?
Let's go there!
He's got a rock-solid alibi
She's got a rock-solid alibi
It's rock-solid
Tom wasn't absent last Monday
I'm still planning to go
I don't need them anymore
Tom wasn't the man in charge
I'm still pretty busy
I'm still doing well
I'm still skeptical about this
Tom won't do that, but I will
I'm still short on cash
Can you come early today?
Let's give Tom a second chance
I'm telepathic
Is Tom even a real doctor?
I will go to Japan in 2020
I promise I'll come back
I'm very well prepared
He's a musical genius
I'm still in good shape
Do you eat apples?
I'll drink water
I'm going to drink water
I won't take a shower
I eat, you eat, he eats
I'm still planning on going
Bye, good night
Good morning, nice to meet you
Tom won't know what that means
I'm still as busy as ever
I'm still sorting it out
Tom won't buy the blue sweater
They've washed your dog
I'm still underage
I'm very sorry about that
I'm very curious about that
I'm still considering it
I'll prepare some sandwiches
I'm still checking
I'm very proud of you all
I'm still very busy
I like Yanni.
It's bad
That's what I want to give Tom
That's likely to happen
Tom wasn't alone in his room
I'm still not sure why
Let's talk about women
What do women like?
Don't be aggressive to a woman
Women don't like wimps
Dick jokes are always funny.
Tom won't ever allow you to go
I'm still having fun
I'm very skeptical
Sorry, man
I'm very happy with that
Who opened the fire?
We're Greek, and you?
It's lunch time!
I'm going to be ready
How many of them died?
I'm getting closer
I'm going to work on it
I'm safe for now
Why not give it to Tom?
Mary was there, too
Yanni can't speak any Berber
What are you doing in Algeria?
Come inside, and I'll tell you
Yanni's boots are too girly
What do women like in men?
I'm doing better
Have you been sleeping in it?
Who made Tom do it?
That's a boy
That's a girl
I like to pretend I'm an actor
Is that a man?
The ghost can fly!
Is that a woman?
I'm going to look into it
He's a man, and she's a woman
I'm out of food
Tom's wife is French
Tom's wife is German
Tom's wife is Australian
Yes, unfortunately
I'm willing to give this a try
I'm going to try again
Tom wasn't scared to do that
No one's perfect at it
I knew he'd win
Could Tom do it?
It's only gotten worse
I'm going to come again
I'll let Tom do it
I'm going to have to move
I'll tell you all I can
She's typing something
There's no one better than you
This is democracy, I think
That proves I'm right
I'm being cautious
I can't type fast
It's a key card
Tom's winking at Mary
What was your first word?
Which route has he taken?
Which route did he take?
Have the rules changed?
Tom reads his wife's diary
Tom's reading his wife's diary
Tom's a pragmatist
Do you know how to tile?
Do you know how to lay tiles?
Do you know how to do tiling?
Did you learn Latin at school?
Can I borrow your hairdryer?
I'm getting nowhere
That's Tom's fork
That's the fork Tom was using
You're a fine piece of ass.
Don't sit on that
Don't sit there
Don't sit here
Don't sit on my hat
Don't sit on the cat
Don't sit on that bench
It's just been painted
Algiers is an open-minded city
I'm starting over
I'm going to make wine
Tom won't be at work on Monday
I'm coming back in a minute
I'm going to work on this
I'm going to pay for this
I'll help Tom do it
Tom's a recluse
You wanna leave us already?
The fan doesn't rotate
The pool water's nice and cool
That's all I know about him
This part doesn't work
That's all I know about her
It's easy to get to Algiers
I'm in Algiers finally
Time will tell if I'm right
You're it!
I'm going to need a lawyer
I'm going to consider it
What is Algeria famous for?
Tom won't ever consent to that
It's simply too soon to tell
I've been told to wait
Follow the instructions!
Do we find the same solutions?
I'm eating popcorn
I don't understand your answer
Run away as fast as you can!
I'm halfway home
I'm going to survive
She won't be away for long
Don't tell them we sent you
Mary wore high-heeled shoes
I'm going to replace the fuse
Has Tom done it?
Tom is very self-critical
Tom's dog is happy
I'm going to practice
When did you wake up?
It's very hot at night
I'm falling behind
I'm going this way
I'm going to need a loan
He couldn't speak French well
He wasn't able to open the box
Yanni didn't believe Skura
I'm probably going to lose
You don't need one.
Yanni didn't dare turn around
I didn't attend the ceremony
He didn't attend the ceremony
She didn't attend the ceremony
We didn't attend the ceremony
Will you shut up, man?
I'm going to eat pretty soon
Tom won't like being in Boston
Oh my shattered nerves!
I'm through here
O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!
It's a difficult issue
Khadija said "Never!
Will they drive me out ?
I'm the new owner
They don't tell me what to do
What's a cat?
Haya' is a part of faith
I won't get dragged into that
I'm going to go camping
Tom wasn't told not to leave
I'm going to my place
What is he going to say?
There are no five-euro coins
Do I really have to buy that?
That's all that I can tell you
It's probably too soon to tell
I'm about done here
I'm protecting you
I'm going to need it
I'm going to need them
Will Tom do it?
I'm looking into it
Would Tom do this?
Tom wasn't as scared as Mary
I'm going to be rich
I'm going to make some changes
I thought I'd give it a shot
What are you doing after this?
Tom isn't playing golf, is he?
We're cooks
Tom isn't your brother, is he?
Tom isn't swimming now, is he?
Tom isn't afraid of us, is he?
I love that actor!
I can't stand him.
Have you got toothache?
Let's go ice skating
What are you drinking there?
Do you want a cup?
Sam hasn't answered my message
Sam didn't answer my message
Sorry!
Is Tom there?
Yes, I know that.
Exactly!
Well he's not here, either.
Look!
Tom's outside
What's he doing here?
Do you eat in the living room?
That's the living room
No, I like that one, there
Is that your bedroom?
She could've done it herself
The washing machine's full
The washing machine's full
Tom isn't coming today, is he?
We're monks
You're too gullible
Tom isn't still crying, is he?
Did I answer your question?
You're both cute
You're too old for that
You didn't win
You'll win
You're a hero, Tom
You're no hero, Tom
You're a thief, Tom
You're staying here
You're a wonderful husband.
And you, a wonderful wife.
I didn't hear you say that
Did you order these flowers?
Did you order the flowers?
Did you order the cake?
Why are you home so soon?
You're fun to live with
You don't even clean your room
You don't do anything
Are you feeling alright?
Much better.
Wait a second.
I don't have a second.
Would you let me do my job?
Why don't you stay home today?
You're a great cook, you know
You're not going to that party
You're not going there
Did you hear the phone ring?
Do you still think about her?
I'll never vote for you again
What's the matter?
Why are you crying?
You mean you don't object?
You're so unselfish
You're a fighter, Tom
If you need us, we'll be here
You're a barbarian, Tom
You're a sorcerer, Tom
You're a wizard, Tom
You're a warlock, Tom
You're a warrior, Tom
Tom isn't Mary's uncle, is he?
Tom, Mary is here
Where are you?
Tom isn't left-handed, is he?
Yanni is ruining Skura's life
You're vulnerable
Admit that you're vulnerable
Donald Trump has COVID-19
Tom isn't back in town, is he?
You're lucky
You don't need experience
Tom isn't good at this, is he?
I'm younger than she is
Tom isn't leaving soon, is he?
Are you left-handed?
Do you have evidence?
Tom isn't still single, is he?
Tom wasn't in the store
How old is your grandson?
Tom isn't right-handed, is he?
There's more to it than this
Tom isn't in the store
She's sharp as a tack
That didn't last long
How was the weather?
Do you like garlic bread?
Tom doesn't like garlic bread
What are you doing after this?
I'm not doing anything.
I'm not sure I've ever met Tom
Tom isn't here to stay, is he?
Tom thinks I'm lazy
She's a snob
Tom isn't going to cry, is he?
Will you keep us company?
Tom isn't a pharmacist, is he?
We're OK now

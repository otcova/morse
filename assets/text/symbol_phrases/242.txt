You're usually quite organized
You're still young and healthy
You're always so unpredictable
You haven't yet paid your rent
Maybe I should've tried harder
Maybe I didn't try hard enough

We're taking you to Egypt
Things can't be worse
He's back again
Come visit us!
I've never seen Cairo
Will you hire me?
Will he hire me?
I wonder if I'll get the job
I'm scared of spiders
It's a lovely flower
What does this product do?
Why should I buy your product?
I'm a marketer
I'll come on Friday afternoon
He's trying to sell me stuff
How long will the trip take?
It's a delusion
Let's just leave it at that
I'm terrible at German
It's a complicated language
I didn't save the file
I didn't save the document
What search engine do you use?
Where is the cash register?
The computer's malfunctioning
Can you help your brother?
Don't reproach your friend
She's got to buy them overseas
Are you satisfied, finally?
Tom's bedroom door is shut
A woman's crying is worthless
A woman's tears are worthless
No need to tell me twice!
Right around the corner!
I've bought an electric bike
Don't dirty it!
Don't get it dirty!
Don't make it dirty!
Tom's apartment was small
Tom's flat was small
I'm no good at maths
May I speak to Mr. Nakagawa?
It's me
I don't remember the words
It was a holiday?
That wasn't such a bad idea
It doesn't cost anything
You're right actually
That's correct, actually
The barn is on fire!
Have they talked about it?
This work doesn't suit me
Don't shoot before my order!
Make yourself at home!
Don't tell me
I don't need to know
Someday I'll find you
Let's eat some pasta
I bought an e-bike
Why don't you try this?
Why are you not happy anymore?
I'm proud of you, son
You're still drunk

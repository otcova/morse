“Go, she's waiting for you”
Victoria Ruffo is a goddess!
Can we ask Tom?
I hope that you're right
She is really wasteful!
You'll suffer the consequences
Are you coming, too?
I love Tatoeba!
We're volunteers
I'm still a bit dizzy
What exactly did Tom do?
What's for dinner, mom?
Tom isn't behaving himself
I'm paralyzed from the neck up
Why are pundits so pig-headed?
Stand up for your rights!
I'll finish it
Are your parents divorced?
Ramming speed, captain!
We're limo drivers
Tom might like this T-shirt
Don't let it get to your head
The meat is medium-rare
We're purists
How would you like your steak?
Well done, please.
Tom's behavior is insufferable
Tom's screams were inaudible
Tom's fearlessness is laudable
Let's go waterskiing
Everything's been stolen
Tom won't be able to lift that
Tom can't lift it up
What is it with your accent?
If you want, we'll help you
Will you come, too?
Fortunately, Tom didn't die
I see you got it, too
I'll ask Tom to do it for us
I've scolded Tom many times
I've forgiven Tom already
Tom's death made everyone sad
We're meteorologists
That could happen to us, too
If you do that, we will, too
You've spoiled Tom
Who threatened you?
They're in trouble
Can you help them?
We're hockey fans
I've come earlier today
Yanni's bad breath was back
Do you have children, too?
Yanni couldn't pay the cab

Why didn't Yanni take the bus?
Yanni's blood was boiling
We're French students
Yanni's mom is working

Before steroids!
I'm going to see Tom right now

What you can do, I can, too
Were we invited, too?

Tom plays chess badly, too
We're smart men
Is this too long?
Who fears the truth?
Tom is Mary's only uncle
What shall I do with that?
Don't waste your time!
We're freshmen at Harvard
I'll go see how Tom is
Pour me one, too
I'm glad that nobody died
We're curious about that
I can't say no to Tom
Tom didn't take that seriously
Why did he ask?
We're fathers
Do you know where is what?
How hot is that?
I'm going to show you around
How could you forgive him?
How could you forgive her?
How could you, Tom?
I'll get Tom to do it for us
I don't know.
Do you understand this?
Full ahead!
Half ahead!
Slow ahead!
Dead slow ahead!
Full astern!
Half astern!
Slow astern!
Dead slow astern!
Stop engine!
I'll only go if Tom goes, too
I didn't teach you that
We're a bit busy
We don't know who to talk to
If you do it, we'll do it, too
I've already met everybody
I've already met everyone
You shouldn't sleep in class
We're free men
Give me a bit of water, quick!
I'll start today
I know you're very busy, too
It's not correct
It's on your left
It's nearby
We're coal miners
Where is a good hotel?
If I can do this, you can, too
It's hotel staff
Yanni's door has no dead bolt
I don't see why Tom would lie
I think I'll have a drink.
I think I'll have one, too.
Colonizers aren't immigrants
Is your husband coming, too?
Yanni's door creaked open
Next time, don't be an ass
The cat's already been fed
Can you make a video on that?
We're worn out
Do you really like your job?
The cats've already been fed
What made you get into tennis?
Why are you asking that?

I'm not going to give you BS
What nationality are you?
Where did you travel to?
Why don't you like the movie?
Do you like to ski?
Did you practice that?
When can I meet you again?
Don't go into the details
Are you an introvert man?
What do you want from a woman?
Why do you come here often?
Do you have any hobby?
How do you know Yanni?
It hurt me, too
I'm tired
I'm afraid of wolves
I'm forty now
May I have a look, too?
We're biology students
My parents are divorced, too
We'll change
They'll all need to work hard
I'm kind of lazy
We're good guessers
Tom, are you going with us?
I don't go to museums
Will you kill him?
What did you give me here?
Can you do that, too?
Go check and see if he's home
Go check and see if she's home
We're a little old-fashioned
Malka's a good singer
Does Tom still do it?
She's a famous singer
Was she in the reception area?
They cancelled Tom's book
Can I do it, too?
It's the beginning of the year
Can Tom really do it?
I want to stay for 5 or 6 days
I want to stay for 3 or 4 days
We're at work
Can you read Russian?
All you need is about $300
They're just cats being cats
Whose turn is it to shuffle?
Is that why?
I'm sat on top of the table
We're slow readers
You can't accept your failure
Did Tom do it himself?
If you can, wake him up
We're proud of Mary
“Excuse me”
“Are you Fernando Lopez?”
“Yes, I am”
I know, it's just..
Am I your girlfriend?
May I borrow your computer?
They will perform an x-ray

We'll sue you
We can't come now
We're golfers
Mine are, too.
Is Tom insured?
If you come, they'll come, too
I'm breastfeeding
Can you hear that, too?
Who made Tom do this?
We're graduates of Harvard
Now's really not the time
Does he do any sort of sport?
Tom's not a caretaker
She's picky
She doesn't eat just anything
She's picky
The garden isn't looked after
Pay the bill when you're ready
I'm quite confused
They've got a house
Have you turned off the telly?
Have you turned the telly off?
When will she arrive?
When is she going to arrive?
Is the house there yours?
Is that house there yours?
Is that house yours?
She wasn't at home
You're a sly one
You're a crafty one
It's just a saying
On the table.
Mum, where're the pegs?
On the table.
Are you going on this bus?
No, it's too full.
Are you going on that bus?
No, it's too full.
No, that one's too full.
Her hair wasn't long last year
She's always talking about you
Are you having dinner now?
Then you'll have to hurry
Then you'll have to hurry up
You've got an excellent memory
Don't feel obliged to go
Your house is really nice!
You've learnt fast
You've learnt quickly
You're unfair to her
You're being unfair to her
You've just got to rest a bit
We're musicians
That tree's so big!
I'm making a paper airplane
Is rice eaten in your country?
I thought I'd lost my keys
I didn't see Tom fall
Well I don't plan on going
I must be speaking Chinese!
Are you going?
Maybe.
I don't want to walk anymore
These are your paintings?
Are these your paintings?
Yanni's car won't start
Yanni couldn't feel his legs
We don't have much water left
There isn't much coffee left
Was he in Paris?
I'd like to speak more quickly
It is I who's giving up
Where does she live?
Have you seen my key?
We're seniors at Harvard
That's not a road
It's just a path
This machine doesn't work
Tom was drunk, too
Told you he's a vampire.
We're friends of theirs
Yanni gripped Skura's hip
I'm a dressmaker
If you testify, Tom will, too
I'm a fish
Where you knew me from?
Tom did this, not me
My sister-in-law is knocked up
Yanni's wife kicked him out
I don't have anyone to vent to
We're tattoo artists
Berber.
Pardon me?
He was shouting in Berber.
I haven't got anything to wear
You're a very refined man
I'm tired of sitting
It's unsuitable for children
Why do you hate cats?
Yanni's cat is sick

That's another debate
Do you like zucchini?
I'll be away tomorrow
That's just an excuse!
He's cross eyed
We're very light sleepers
I'm making lunch
Where can I study Norwegian?
Hatred doesn't solve anything
We've had it
We're minors
We're a lot braver than Tom
She was cold, but I wasn't
Tom said he'd do it
I'm not biased against Tom
I'm not the man you think I am
We're wealthy men
Can he speak Dutch?
Can she speak Dutch?
Can they speak Dutch?
I don't speak Dutch
Does she speak Dutch?
I can't speak Dutch
I don't speak Dutch well
It's not that kind of thing
We'll mention it to Tom
I've never confessed
We're rednecks
What does the cartel say?
I'm up to here!
“I will follow my path
Let's help Tom do it
We're conservatives
Incredible!
How is it correct?
I don't really agree
Tom lost Mary's number
I'm an airplane pilot
Did Tom look bored?
We're preschool teachers

I'm afraid to eat it
What's a census?
Mary's bedroom is pink
I'm tired of all this

We're firemen
Thanks, Tom
We're city girls
Why's Tom doing this?
I won't do this
We're cameramen
Don't even doubt it
I'm a drama student
We're smart guys
I'm from Boston, too
Would you mind if I didn't go?
I've never skipped a class
Tom's wife gave birth to twins
Don't let anyone in Tom's room
We're a bit pressed for time
Something's still not right
How did Tom ever get so lucky?
Tom's face suddenly turned red
Thanks, I'd like that
I won't come alone
I wasn't outside yet
I'm gonna try come after work
That's Tom's canoe
Don't tell Tom why we did that
We couldn't rescue Tom
We weren't able to rescue Tom
Tom's bedroom is blue
It's too loud in here
I can't hear you
Now's not the time to do that
It's cooled down a bit
I think you'll enjoy it there
I've lost my way
It's cold outside
He's in Scotland
We're lucky men
It'll be easier this year
It'll be much better next year
She's in Scotland
I'll let Tom do this
He won't receive guests
I'm not one to hold a grudge
Yes, I understand them
What will I do?
I don't bother you anymore
For me, it's everything
I'm in third grade
He's preparing for the worst
It's too hot this summer
Is your brain on vacation?
We're civilians
At least do that right!
Tom never thinks he's wrong
Somebody's waiting to see us
There's some
Damn, I forgot my pills
I didn't hear Tom scream
I didn't hear Tom's screams
I don't like this show
Is that justification?
I'm a shoemaker
We're hard workers
That's why I am asking
Can you drive until there?
I don't like it, period
We're a little rusty
Do it step by step!
I don't like kissing
We're single parents
It's in Scotland
But you do not cry!
Love yourself!
Have a good sleep!
Turn back!
Grief makes one hour ten!
What are you playing?
How do you tie a tie?
We're communists
It's a long distance from here
Checkmate, atheists
Do not spoil me!
Do you like us?
How did you learn Toki Pona?
We're men, not boys
They don't feel dizzy
I'll go back there
Tom does, too
We're really bad dancers
I'm so sorry for you
He's ignoring me
I don't have a single kopek
We're screenwriters
We won't eat that
Can I take your order?
Go home, Tom
You're drunk
We're botanists
I don't trust it
We can't ski
I'll do what I'm told
We're single mothers
Tom isn't a greedy person
We're a little homesick
I can't solve this puzzle
We went, too
I'm glad Tom did this
Is Tom really reliable?
Tom says that's OK with him
It'll be much better next time
We're dads now
I'm not your nanny
Tom, what's wrong?
Tom, what's wrong?
Tom, what's wrong?
Tom, what's wrong?
Tom, what's wrong?
You're very pale
Who fired Tom?
We're physicists
I'd ask Tom if I were you
That's the reason Tom is late
You've got a beautiful smile
It's just a facade
We're designers
I don't eat nuts
What's that you're drinking?
Fancy a cup?
Tom can't eat that
That's just the half of it
Is that what you had in mind?
Have you got a headache again?
Do you have a headache again?
Can you still see him?
They're threshing barley
How can I surprise my wife?
You're lying.
No, I'm not.
You're a funny man, Tom
I'm going to buy a helmet
How is Tom better than me?
You're heroes
You're gonna see it
I'm gonna be honest with you
How old is this car?
I don't know if Tom is sick
Can I leave this here?
You're untouchable
Tom's wallet was stolen
Don't ruin your own happiness
I'll figure it out myself
Say something, man
Don't worry
What is freedom?
Let Tom know we're leaving
Were there any guests?
Explain that, atheists
I'll give you three days
I said what I said!
You're really dumb
Don't raise your hand at me!
Let's try to corner Tom
You can't fool us
Do you remember our old flat?
Is that serious?
Let's move quickly
My name's Tom, not John
Who gave Tom our address?
Tom's bike is blue
Tom swore he'd do it
Is Mary one of your sisters?
Can you get down there?
Can you get down here?
She's fast
Who threatened Tom?
It's safe
I'll complain to Tom
You don't count
We didn't dare to ask Tom
It's not that long
What's Tom singing?
Whose is that?
Let me go," Tom pleaded
Can you milk a cow?
I'm wearing my new shoes
I'm Tom
This is my wife, Mary
What is Tom still doing here?
It's time to leave Tom
Is this all we have?
Is Tom a polyglot?
Finally, we're home
Is Tom coming soon?
You're an idealist
This won't help Tom
Who wants to drive?
I don't want to risk that
I shouldn't have fired Tom
You'll lose anyway
Tom's a loner
Was Tom conscious?
May I attend?
What time did you wake Tom up?
You're the real hero
You're the real thief
You're a real fighter
You're a real wizard
This game is really old-school
Why isn't Tom going?
Would you be able to do it?
That was Tom's plan
Did you miss Tom?
You can't go home
We don't know who that man is
How can you contact Tom?
I'll go and lie down
What diseases has Tom had?
Tom didn't mind that
What a strange name!
You'd better get busy
I didn't get to see Tom
You're an old man
Tom's shirt is ripped
Don't tell Tom I'm leaving
Today isn't Tom's birthday
We're pharmacists
You won't need this
I'm lonely without Tom
I wish that Tom hadn't left
Who told Tom about it?
Do they need help?
What university do you go to?
Tom says he'll try
Don't you dare call Tom
We're tourists
You shouldn't sing
Is that the North Star?
You shouldn't tell Tom that
What will we play?
We don't need it
I'm going to need more room
Did you tell anyone?
Tom's words gave Mary comfort
I'm a systems analyst
Will you eat dinner with Tom?
You'd better get out
Age doesn't matter
I didn't take part in that
It'll be a blow to Tom
Where's Yanni?
What?
He's taking a dump.
Whose voice is that?
Did Tom just call?
How much is the bus ride?
How old is your boy?
Send me Tom's number
We're slow eaters
Excuse me, are you a student?
Are you being well paid?
Do you have a good contract?
Do you speak Occitan?
And you?
My name is Joano — and yours?
Where do you go then?
Is Tom coming, too?
It's only a short trip
Enjoy it!
Did you ask Tom to help me?
You'd better go first
Tom won't let anybody in
What did you ask?
I don’t know what I want
Why all this hype?
I bought shoes for R50
I'm ready to do anything
You'd better not sing
That isn't why I love Tom
What made Tom do it?
We're surveyors
You've got a big heart
We don't need to do it
It's useless to ask Tom
You've already told us this
Come here immediately !
I won't chase
Do you sell cookies?
I'm thinking about something
Is Mary one of your nieces?
How's Tom's knee?
They're sleepy

How should I deal with Tom?
You're a sissy
They're non-GMO
They're organic
They're vegan
They're gluten-free
The cookies are gluten-free
Is it OK?
Can't you go?
You'd better call your family
I don't want to keep this
Tell Tom I won't come
What else is wrong?
Will Tom come?
You can't get it
Tom's wife suddenly fell sick
You've got a crush on Tom
You've got a crush on Mary
You've got a crush on him
You've got a crush on her
If I like it there, I'll stay
Tom won't let anyone in
You're so graceful
I'll tell her so then
Did Tom put you up to this?
Tom's knee is fine
I'm not going to bed yet
Who's Tom drinking with?
You don't eat much, do you?
You're a very special person
I need you here right now!
Are you and Tom brothers?
Who ate all the pizza?
The fish reeks, it's gone bad
The referee didn't see it
It's an even number
I won't do it in a hurry
Is there imported beer too?
My diet isn't healthy
How's Tom doing there?
Don't read that book!
It's cold
You didn't eat much
When did you speak to Tom?
Wow!
Did you see that?
I'll be waiting here for Tom
Why did Tom need it?
Tom didn't win anything
Ah, there Tom is
What's a dolphin?
Why would I kill Tom?
Tom's productive
Don't buy anything from Tom
I know that you miss me, too
I know you miss me, too
I'm going to by Tom's bicycle
You're supposed to stay here

You see, Mary?
We're a little anxious
Hey, what are you doing?
What am I doing?
Not much, you?
Oh, not much.
Say it, don't spray it
What's your favorite NBA team?
What's your favorite NFL team?
Have you ever played hockey?
I'm willing to pay for it
Are you sure it's waterproof?
That's it for today
We'll see you next time
I'm exhausted
I don't know how you do it
You've worked so hard for it
Why didn't you leave Tom?
Tom, you're useless
I'll deal with this later
Tom's cat is cute
Do you live here, Tom?
We're Canadian citizens
Don't do that, that's gross!
When will you be free?
Now's not a good time
How about tomorrow?
Is Mary your niece?
Has it already been sold?
That's all I know about Tom
Today's not Tom's birthday
Don't count on us
I shouldn't have refused
You're right
I can't stay here
Whose van is that?
I don't love this world

Leave Tom alone, will you?
Tom's company was sued
What's the point?
You're already 2 hours late
I'll sit here and wait for Tom
Mary is a secretary, right?
How many foreigners work here?
I'd like you to go see Tom
We're carpenters
Dad, buy me a vuvuzela
I don't have any more cheese
I don't have any cheese
Let me through!
Congratulations, my friend!
I'd prefer that you here
It's getting late
Where's my sugar?
Did Tom help you?
That noise won't let me sleep
Whoever has it, bring it
Tom hasn't yet registered
I don't like falling behind
A hair salon isn't a wig store
Vanessa's calling you
He's a down-and-out guy
They haven't told Tom yet
I'm just telling that
We're vegetarians
You eat rice, don't you?
Why should Tom stop?
I just can't stand it
Did Tom invite you?
Are you coming soon?
You're no better than I am
Tom didn't hear the shot
I've never beat Tom
Don't let anyone in my room
Do they know where Tom is?
You're a hero
I'm willing to be your slave
How's Tom's back?
Yanni called Skura's name
What happened on the news?
I'm talking about sex
What about your friends?
Speak up before it's too late!
I'm very awkward
Why did I do such a thing?
It's almost here
Prepare yourself!
Get ready!
Do these words form a unit?
He didn't do me wrong
Unleash your creativity!
I can't reach it from here
Have you been feeling sick?
Are you stressed?
Do you feel stressed?
Please speak in your language!
You're leaving too?
For now, we're doing well
Staying home isn't pleasant
Why did you drag us here?
Could I please have the check?
Can we work something out?
Can't we work something out?
We shouldn't be doing that
He can't maintain high notes
You should've known
Is he capable?
Do you sleep with glasses?
We'll get through it somehow
I thought I'd seen it all
Do you study numerology?
Don't be aggressive
Don't obsess over numbers
Were you afraid of me?
Don't let them fall

But where are the parents?
He's from the American embassy
I'm going with his brother
Are you going up there?
What games does he like?
I think that's not mine
I'll give you the pen
Do you know who called us?
I'm a bit strange
I don't regret my actions
I'm sad that he's leaving
I'm sad that she's leaving
We weren't very clever
It's not so hot anymore
One of the desk's legs broke
How much is that cheese?
He's going to dance
How much for the cheese?
What a bad day!
What a sucky day!
Will you come to pick me up?
It's not easy to believe
I've bought a tub of butter
I'm going to lose weight
Can we apply?
Don't go that fast
Aren't we going to Greece?
I couldn't watch him suffer
I don't always do what's right
I don't want to anymore
I don't need to anymore
Well I don't have any symptoms
Emel, come home
It says it wasn't there
I'd like a glass
What time will we have lunch?
Do I look like a doctor?
What are you asking me for?
Hold this!
May the devil take me!
Did you see Tom fall?
Did Tom lie to us?
Don't feel obliged to do that
How old is your girl?
I didn't get anything from Tom
Why do you look so doleful?
I'm a punter
I like rosé better
Is that your boy?
Is that your girl?
You're the winner
Here are Tom's things
I can't go over it
Is Tom really related to you?
You'll lose again
Didn't it bother you?
OK, fine
But no more!
Let me think!
I don't like cucumbers
Is Tom as smart as Mary?
Here's where I get off
Tom wasn't on duty that night
That's one of my daily duties
Tell Tom I'll come
That's it, friends
Tom's request was denied
That's all, folks
They've already been alerted
That's one of my daily chores
You people can't stay here
Get used to it, kid
Stop calling me a little kid!
Tom's laundry day is Monday
Oh really?
That's my favorite movie too!
Does Tom want to come here?
I think I heard Tom's voice
We're good listeners
I'm a urologist
It's up to me to tell Tom
Let's tell Tom everything
I'd prefer to sit in the back
I'd rather sit in the back
Is it time already?
I only hope it's not too late
I'm an epidemiologist
Can we go crazy now?
They're probably all dead now
Would anyone like more coffee?
There's no cell service here
Is this a bribe?
We'll send Tom a letter
Yes, you can use it
Any RPGs that you're into?
I can't even describe it
Who do you believe, Tom or me?
Now I wish I didn't have ears
What kind of animal are you?
Are those plastic fangs?
I'm going to buy tickets
What's a spa?
Has anyone informed Tom?
Will you come with Tom?
Let's finish it
Is Tom better already?
I can't miss the meeting
Tom's house is far away
Is this a prank?
How did Tom take this news?
Let's leave it here
I'm an islander
Let's ask Tom to sing a song
What kind of bread is this?
Let's drink tea
I would've done better
That won't stop Tom
Is that Tom's bike?
You can do it, girl
Is that a lizard?
We're safe drivers
I'll manage somehow
Why's Tom so skeptical?
Does Tom also sing?
Is Tom blackmailing you?
Why do we need Tom's help?
Don't get entangled with him
Which one is older?
He never read Tom's novel
I think Tom won't be happy
Let's not quarrel
Do you believe in Santa?
Tom never does what he's told
Tom always does what he's told
We'll talk when you come back
I'll go out like this today
When can we talk?
Can I speak to the director?
Mary is my great-niece
Maybe I'm crazy
I promise that I'll come back
I promise I'll be back
I promise that I'll be back
I've never seen Tom here
When will the bus be here?
I don't like hospitals

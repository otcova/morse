Today is my birthday!
How exciting!
I haven't seen you for years
Yay!
As usual, you're right
Tom won't be eating alone

Why are you so angry?
Why are you so sad?
Today wasn't that awful
What are keys made of?
This one looks pretty!

I really don't understand you
Tom won't be here with me
Tom wasn't guilty
Tom won't have to do it

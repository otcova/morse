Don't be so loud
Children don't keep still
Don't be so childish
It's dangerous
How are the kids?
Be ambitious, children
Don't make fun of children
Don't spoil the children
Don't be soft with kids
It's dangerous
Kid's a hustler
How many kids do you have?
Children are poor men's riches
I don't want to have children
Is that abnormal?
Don't spoil your child
It's a book for children
Beat it, kids!
How is it in the market?
Where's the bus for the city?
I'll show you around the city
I'd like a map of the city
I'd like a city map
I don't recall
It's not even worth a thought
She's an outspoken person
I can't read your mind
I couldn't help laughing out
Is using fingers uncivilized?
Don't cut your finger
He wouldn't even lift a finger
Are there reserved seats?

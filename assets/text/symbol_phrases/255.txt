And it's yours
Today is a wonderful day!
Are you together?
Irma is a category 5 hurricane

He's a strange fellow
He's a queer bird
He's a queer customer

Thank you for listening to us!
I know you're having an affair
I don't have any other plans
You're completely heartless
You shouldn't talk like that
Is this about money?
Sami's death was accidental
Sami's secrets were exposed
Sami's smile was amazing
I want to be Mrs. Bakir
Fool Sami once, shame on you
Sami wasn't in the mood
Is Sami breathing?
What really happened that day?
It doesn't make sense.
Sami didn't drown by accident
Sami's death was a murder
Who would hurt Sami?
Sami noticed Layla's jewellery
We all know that's not true
Sami knew about Layla's affair
I can't wait to be Mrs. Bakir
I trusted you, Sami
Sami was a ladies' man
Sami wasn't able to win
Sami didn't drink
Who wouldn't love Sami?
Sami's car was parked there
Careful!
You're stepping on a snail
What are you eating right now?
Who do you know in this town?
Good, talk to me
He's very careless.
It's not the time to surrender
Late-comers were not admitted
I found a part-time job
I'm worried about the weather
Any word from Mary?
This isn't up for discussion
Stop it, Tom!
It's not funny anymore!
Don't judge her too harshly
Don't judge him too harshly
It's nice to have friends
Can we be friends?

What's his name?
Yes, I'm cheating on you.
And who is he?
Sami didn't really know why

Tell me some rib-ticklers
Why so?
You amaze me, Holmes," said I
Sami wasn't home a lot
Sami was unfaithful, too
Sami was Layla's boy toy
Now she'll think it's true
It's typical autumn weather
The blundering fool!
What's the matter?
I'm so sorry about that
Have you any arms?
Come in," I cried
The get-up was inimitable
Have you found it, Wiggins?
I will tell you all, sir
Stangerson too!" he muttered
The plot thickens.
My case is complete.
We all think that we're unique

Whatever you say, mate
Where is all of our money?
I can't live like this
I'm filing for divorce
I know it's my graduation
Is Mom coming over?
I haven't even got up yet
Just shut up, will you?
You have ruined my make-up
I'm your cousin
You're so charming
You're so brave
Who's that fat ass?
She's his new girlfriend.
Sami's arm was in a cast
Mission accomplished, general
Who are those girls?
We'll defeat them in the end
Open the door, it's Sami
I'm begging you!
Did they rape you?
Were you... raped?
Officer, I beg you to help me
Will you shut up now?
You're a stinking moron
You're forcing me to do this
Are they going to rape us?
What will happen now?
Look at you, you're crying
It's alright
We're just a bunch of weirdos
You're my beautiful princess
Don't get stressed
Open the door for God's sake
You're insulting me
I think he's gay
I promise I'll talk to him
Oh, no!
What's happening now?
You're not wearing gloves
You're not leaving anywhere
You can't even change a diaper
Where are you going?
Anywhere but here.
I know you don't deserve that
You didn't look lost
See?
This isn't so bad
How about the chest area?
She's probably a B.
Don't worry about my dad
Why don't you try this bra on?
Is she feeling better?
I'll talk to them
Can you talk?
Do you have a name?
I'm so excited
We're going to the beach today
To the beach.
I'm your mother.
Stepmother.
Can you skip the intro?
You're not even my mom
I've done the lingerie
I promise I'll do it later.
There is no later.
I'm just practising for work
To me, this looks sexual
What kind of make-up is this?
Have you become a prostitute?
What kind of make-up is this?
Are you a prostitute?
This isn't very modest
So far, it's been really great
I can't see very well
I'm trying to become a singer
I've just turned twenty
Are you hungry?
I'm starving.
She's laughing
Is your name Layla?
They've already forgotten
They've already won
Sami doesn't have an address
What kind of person Sami was?
Sami doesn't date
It's all happening here today!
That's not your beer!
He's sitting in a meeting
We mustn't complain!
Where are the soldiers going?
Whose bike did you take?
I don't eat pears
There's no more cheese
Brrr!
Winter's coming!
Sure, I'll gladly do that
Now I've forgotten your name
I'm not so highly endowed
I did not deceive you, mon ami
Yes, of course.
Well, people are like that too
He saw it, too!
I'm divorcing your father
I thought you loved Sami.
I did, but it's over now.
You're talking like a child
Sami didn't make any noise
Sami wasn't even breathing
Sami couldn't see his target
Sami didn't want to hurt Layla
Sami wasn't even in the area
Sami didn't intend to do that
Sami wasn't even there
Sami has become Layla's life
Sami inherited Layla's fortune
You can't come over
Sami wasn't very sick
Finally, Sami has had enough
Let's invite them for dinner
Sami didn't want Layla to die
That's the best textbook
Where do your parents live?
Are you and Maria siblings?
He's talking to her father
I'll get it now
Tom was 15, Maria 14
Is she an early bedder?
Congratulations!
You've won a waffle iron!
What will you do today?
That's enough
Mary, stop it
That's enough
Tom, stop it
That's enough!
Tom mowed Mary's lawn
Do you want some iced tea?
Think, Tom
Do as your mother says!
Why me of all people?
You speak German well!
I couldn't cry
I can't believe Sami is gone
Oh, you're home!
Is he still there?
What are you talking about?
Who's still there?
Who are you with?
Layla.
Really?
Put her through then.
Layla.
Who was he?
Yes, I'm cheating on you!
And who is he?
Hello.
Sami wasn't hard to love
You can't come
Don't come in
I'm changing
What are you doing?
You can't do anything right
I don't wanna talk about it
Where have you been?
I've been playing soccer.
Could this actually happen?
It's rare for guys to knit
Guess what!
I think not!
I don't think so!
Sami's family was very close
Sami's life totally fell apart
Sami's wife divorced him
What do you have to tell?
I haven't asked you for help
I'm waiting for you
When are you ready?
Mary has treacle-coloured hair
Say goodbye to life!
Where do you live now, then?
It doesn't even have metro.
Tom said Mary wasn't finished
Will you take me?
He won't listen to anyone
She won't listen to anyone
Tom won't listen to anyone
Do you have a Mac or a PC?
How does the brain work?
How does the brain work?
It's complicated.
You've just made my point
Calm down!
Sometimes, I impress myself
I think she's lonely
I think he's lonely
She's painfully shy
When does life begin?
How can I print my résumé?
Not so fast, Tom!
Fresh donuts for Sami!
I have never cheated on you.
Oh, you make me sick!
I feel you're ignoring me
Sami took weight-loss hormones
I don't like what I've become
I want a divorce.
What?
Are you out of your mind?
I'm sorry
It's too late
We're already a family.
Yes, but not officially.
Would you marry me?
Oh, yes!
Of course!
I'm gonna miss that uniform
You're a lucky man.
I know I am.
Where's the baby?
Asleep.
Don't turn your back on me
I hate you.
Divorce me then.
Am I ugly?
You're nothing without me
You're the only one I want
Do you think?
Yes, I do.
How dare you?
I'm not a whore!
It's a bit late
Its a bit late.
Not late for me.
I'd do anything for us
I'd do anything for our future
You're an excellent teacher.
And you, an excellent student.
I know about Layla.
How did you know?
How dare you dump me for her?
She's my wife.
Hello.
Leave us alone!
Don't call this number again!
I'll speak to you soon
I hate you, creep!

I've never seen one in person
I've never seen one in person
What about you?
They'll be looking for help
He didn't even try
You can do it yourself!
What is a haiku?
Did Sami drink all of this?
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
It's called co-dependence
You cheating bitch!
You stupid bastard!
You stupid bastard!
How dare you slap me?
Am I supposed to believe that?
Who were you talking to?
My mom.
Is this for you?

Can one die of fear?
Sami molested Layla's daughter
Sami's stepdad was pretty cool
I hate you.
I hate you, too.
I hate you.
Touch me now if you're a man

It's exactly what Sami wants
This wasn't working
It wasn't working
Sami e-mailed his boss
Sami wasn't trustworthy
I'm so tired of you

Take it easy, we'll find them.
So you're my cousin, Sami.
Yes, and you are?
You'll ruin my make-up
Don't worry
I'll give Sami your message
The dogs won't get to you
Would you stop this silliness?
Would you stop this nonsense?
What happened to that girl?
What did your grandfather say?
Come on, Dad, cut it out
Let's go back to the house
Why are you so stubborn?
You're so cruel

I can't swim as well as you
I can't swim as fast as you
I can't sing as well as you

I can't see anybody
I can't fix my car by myself
I can't do what I need to do

Has anybody here seen Tom?
Everyone's smiling
Everyone knows Tom won't win
Everybody knows Tom won't win
Everyone knows Tom can't win
Everybody knows Tom can't win
Don't let Tom do that alone
Does anyone still do that?
Does anybody still do that?
Do you often eat out?
Do Tom and Mary both snore?
Do both Tom and Mary snore?
Did everyone smile?
Did everybody smile?
Did anyone eat lunch with Tom?
Could you call a taxi for me?
Could you call me a taxi?
Can you do that alone?
Can Tom and Mary both swim?
Can both Tom and Mary swim?
Can I try doing that again?
Can I try to do that again?
Can anyone do that?

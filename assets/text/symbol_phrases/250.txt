He's busy
What do you have to eat?
I'm hungry
Mary isn't my wife
She's my sister
You're a lot older than Tom is
You're a little older than Tom
You'd better not tell Tom that
You shouldn't do that with Tom
You said you'd do that for Tom
You promised Tom you'd do that
We should get out of Tom's way
We don't permit Tom to do that
That's the reason Tom did that
That'll probably impress Tom
Perhaps Tom won't go to Boston
One of Tom's leg was amputated
My coffee cup is next to Tom's
My car is parked next to Tom's
Maybe Tom won't finish on time
Let's have Tom do that for you
It's too late to visit Tom now
It's strange that Tom did that
I've warned Tom not to do that
I've never seen Tom doing that
I've never seen Tom cry before
I've looked for Tom everywhere
I'm willing to do that for Tom
I'm sure that's what Tom wants
I'm sure that's what Tom needs
I'm sure Tom won't be punished
I'm sure Tom won't be prepared
I'm sure Tom won't be arrested
I'm sure Tom will visit Boston

I'm not sure that Tom did that
I'll talk to Tom when he comes
I'll ask Tom to do that for me
I'd never allow Tom to do that
I'd like Tom to do that for me
I wonder why Tom won't do that
I won't have to tell Tom again
I won't be doing that with Tom
I told Tom I'd do that for him
I thought Tom wasn't surprised
I thought Tom wasn't in Boston
I thought Tom wasn't impressed
I think that Tom won't do that
I think Tom wouldn't be scared
I think Tom would've done that
I think Tom won't be surprised
I think Tom won't be back soon
I think Tom could've done that
I shouldn't have let Tom drive
I shouldn't ask Tom to do that
I should've done that with Tom
I should've asked Tom for help
I should tell Tom I'll do that
I know why Tom doesn't like me
I know that Tom didn't do that
I know Tom didn't visit Boston
I know Tom didn't go to Boston
I hope Tom isn't uncooperative
I hope Tom doesn't get annoyed
I hope Tom didn't go to Boston
I hope I didn't disappoint Tom
I heard that Tom won't do that
I don't want to speak with Tom
I don't want to make Tom angry

I didn't go to Boston with Tom
I didn't buy Tom's explanation
I didn't believe what Tom said
I couldn't tell Tom everything
I can't believe Tom is serious
I can't be much older than Tom
I assumed Tom wouldn't do that
May I do that?
No, please don't.
Who's that man?
That's Tom.
You're a lot younger than Tom
You're a lot shorter than Tom
You're a bit shorter than Tom
You're a bad influence on Tom
You hit Tom first, didn't you?

Who told you Tom spoke French?
Where does Tom stay in Boston?

Where did you and Tom do that?
When did you do that with Tom?
What Tom said isn't 100% true
We're waiting for Tom to come
We weren't in Boston with Tom
We don't have to wait for Tom
Those aren't Tom's sunglasses
These aren't Tom's sunglasses
Tell Tom he shouldn't do that
Shouldn't we help Tom do that?
Should we tell Tom to do that?
Please don't do that with Tom
Perhaps Tom will do that, too
Perhaps Tom doesn't drink tea
Most likely Tom won't do that
Maybe Tom has to do that, too
It's a pity that Tom did that
Is Tom really still a student?
If Tom does that, let me know

I'm sure Tom will be sensible
I'm sure Tom will be punished
I'm sure Tom will be punctual

I'm convinced Tom can do that
I'd never speak French to Tom
I won't speak French with Tom
I won't permit Tom to do that
I won't make Tom study French
I won't go to Boston with Tom
I wish I hadn't yelled at Tom

I told Tom I'd be coming back
I told Tom I wouldn't do that
I thought Tom didn't like you

Did Tom say when he'd be here?
Did Tom say he'd visit Boston?

May I do that?
Yes, you may.
Your help isn't needed anymore
You're too young to drink beer
You're too young to buy liquor
You're too drunk to drive home
You're the smartest man I know
You're the smartest guy I know
You're the only one with a key
You're the only drummer I know
You're not expected to do that
You're a very good-looking guy
You're a very good storyteller

You're a lot younger than I am
You're a lot smarter than I am
You're a hard person to please
You're a good basketball coach
You're a bit younger than I am

You'll have to do that as well
You'll get a chance to do that
You'll do that again, I'm sure
You'll be able to do that, too
You'd better do that carefully
You'd be fired if you did that
You shouldn't be in Boston now
You should've done that sooner
You said you'd quit doing that
You said you'd help us do that
You said you'd help me do that
You haven't answer my question
You don't look like you're mad
You can swim, too, if you want
When it rains, I don't do that
What you're doing is unethical
What you're doing is dangerous
We'll never go to Boston again
We'll do that even if it rains
We didn't do that by ourselves
This isn't the time to do that
These lenses are scratch-proof
There's still a lot more to do
There's no time to do that now
There's no easy way to do that
Someone's doing that right now
Please don't speak French here
Please don't forget to do that
Please don't come here anymore
Perhaps you'd enjoy doing that
Perhaps I need to do that, too
Our proposal wasn't acceptable
Now's the time we should leave
My injuries weren't so serious
My house doesn't have a garage
My children can't speak French
My car isn't where I parked it
Most people here don't do that
Most people here can't do that
Men and boys shouldn't do that
Let's not do that by ourselves
Let's go to Boston next spring
It's very important to do that
It's useless to try doing that
It's time to turn on the light
It's hard doing that every day
It's annoying when you do that
It's a good day for doing that
It'll be depressing to do that
It wouldn't be easy to do that
In case of emergency, call 911
If I had the time, I'd do that
I've never seen you cry before
I've never done that, you know
I've grown tired of doing that
I've filled the jug with water
I've done that countless times
I've been asked not to do that
I'm very sorry that I did that

I'm not sure what I have to do
I'm not sure I need to do that
I'm not any good at doing that
I'm nervous whenever I do that
I'll try my hardest to do that
I'll study French this evening
I'll see what I can do to help
I'll only do that if I have to
I'll have to do that by myself
I'll do that only if I have to
I'll do that as long as I live
I'd visit Boston if I were you
I'd prefer not to go to Boston

I'd like you to do that for me
I'd like a hamburger and fries
I'd go to Boston if I were you
I'd be glad to do that for you
I would've bought that for you
I won't likely need to do that
I won't likely have to do that
I won't have to do that myself
I won't be in Boston next week

I thought you wouldn't do that
I think you'll pass this class
I think I'd be able to do that
I still haven't washed the car
I still haven't mowed the lawn
I signed a three-year contract
I shouldn't need any more help
I shouldn't have left so early
I should've refused to do that
I should've done that with you
I should've asked you for help
I really don't want to be here
I probably won't do that today

Tom won't let me speak French
We've done that several times
We've decided to visit Boston
We've decided to study French
We've decided to leave Boston

This bridge was built in 2013
They're testing new equipment
They say that they're worried
They don't eat sausage or ham
There's a calendar over there
That's what people usually do
That's not where I want to go
That's not where I need to go
That's not where I have to go
That's not what I want to buy
That's not what I need to buy
That's not what I have to buy
That's a very sensitive issue
That's a movie worth watching
Shouldn't I be doing that now?
Should I do that now or later?
Please tell me who'll do that
Please don't do that too much
Please don't do that tomorrow
Perhaps you'd like to do that
Our school has 3,000 students
My cat doesn't sleep at night
Maybe we won't finish on time
Maybe I'll study French today
Let's try to do that tomorrow
Let's play cards after dinner
Let's order a pizza for lunch
Let's go to Boston next month
Let's do that some other time
It's way too early to do that
It's too early to do that now
It's no use trying to do that
It's getting warmer every day
It's getting colder every day
It's fun to do that, isn't it?
It's Monday that I'll do that
It'll take forever to do that
It'll soon be time to do that
It'll be expensive to do that
It'll be dangerous to do that
It wasn't much fun doing that
It snows a lot where I'm from
Isn't it dangerous to do that?
Is there a zoo near your home?
Is it OK to speak French here?
Is gold cheaper than platinum?
If you're tired, take a break
I've recently moved to Boston
I've just finished doing that
I've had a lot of girlfriends
I've enjoyed doing that a lot
I've done that numerous times
I've done that enough already
I've been told not to do that
I've been studying since 2:30
I've been doing that all week
I'm very reluctant to do that
I'm troubled by what happened
I'm too poor to hire a lawyer
I'm tired, so I won't do that
I'm thinking about doing that
I'm the owner of this company
I'm the only one who's scared
I'm sure that's what happened
I'm really glad that happened
I'm really enjoying this book
I'm not sure I should do that
I'm not capable of doing that
I'm not as young as you think
I'm not able to do that today
I'm just about to do that now
I'm going to do that tomorrow
I'm busy doing that right now
I'm aware of what's happening
I'm able to understand French
I'll work in Boston next year
I'll do that while it's quiet
I'll do that when I have time
I'll do that if you pay me to
I'll do that even if it rains
I'll be here for three months
I'll arrange to get that done
I'd stay in Boston if I could
I'd recommend studying French
I'd rather you didn't do that
I'd never consider doing that
I'd like to go there with you
I'd like one of those scarves
I'd come to Boston if I could
I'd be tempted to do that now
I won't study French tomorrow
I won't permit you to do that
I won't have to do that alone
I won't have to do that again
I won't go to Boston with you
I won't be doing that anymore
I won't be allowed to do that
I wish I hadn't spoken French
I wish I hadn't eaten so much
I wish I hadn't drunk so much
I wasn't sure I could do that
I wasn't permitted to do that
I wasn't in Boston last month
I wasn't able to study French
I wanted to study French, too
I want to get a part-time job
I thought you weren't married
I thought I'd like to do that
I think I've done that before
I think I'll do that tomorrow
I swear I won't do that again
I still haven't done that yet
I shouldn't do that by myself
I shouldn't be doing this now
I should've done that earlier
I should've called the police
I should've brought more food
I should've been more patient
I should be in Boston by 2:30
I should be back here by 2:30
I probably won't study French
I plan to swim while I'm here
I know you aren't really busy
I know why you didn't do that
I know what's really going on
I know that's not worth doing
I know I'm in big trouble now
I knew I'd be able to do that
I just do what I'm told to do
I hope tomorrow isn't too hot
I hope that you don't do that
I hope it won't snow tomorrow
I hope it won't rain tomorrow
I haven't watered the flowers
I haven't finished the report
I haven't ever studied French
I had a feeling you'd do that
I guess we'll have to do that
I felt I didn't have a choice
I don't yet know what I'll do

I don't want to eat leftovers
I don't want to eat ice cream
I don't want to dance anymore
I don't want to clean my room
I don't want to be left alone
I don't want my picture taken
I don't usually walk anywhere
I don't usually use sunscreen
I don't usually lock my house
I don't usually eat breakfast
I don't usually drive to work
I don't think you can do that
I don't think it was my fault
I don't really need the money
I don't play tennis very well
I don't plan to go to college
I don't often play backgammon
I don't often do that anymore
Tom isn't likely to be last

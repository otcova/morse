I've done nothing unusual
Do you two know something?
Did we run over something?
Can we try something else?
You're doing nothing wrong
We've got nothing to prove
They'll think of something
There's nothing you can do
There's nothing Tom can do
There's nothing to forgive
There's nothing to explain
There's nothing to discuss
There's nothing left to do
There's nothing down there
There's nothing back there
That's better than nothing
Something caught Tom's eye
It's nothing personal, Tom
It wasn't anything serious
Is something wrong with me?
Is something wrong with it?
I've got nothing to report
Do you need something else?
Did you see something else?
Did Tom do something wrong?
Am I doing something wrong?
You're nothing but a coward
We've got nothing in common
Tom's got something we want
There's something behind us
There's nothing we can't do
There's nothing they can do
There's nothing more to eat
There's nothing left to say
There's nothing here for us
There's nothing else to say
There's nothing else to eat
It's something very special
Did you want something, Tom?
Did you need something else?
Can I get something for you?
Aren't we missing something?
Well, I have to do something
We haven't done anything yet
They've got something for us
There's something over there
There's something down there
There's something back there
There's nothing on the table
There's nothing in this room
There's nothing in the trunk
There's nothing here for you
There's nothing for you here
Maybe they'll find something
Let's hope we find something
It's nothing that can't wait
It's clear something's wrong
It wasn't anything important
Is there nothing they can do?
Is something wrong with that?
I haven't found anything yet
Could I say something, please?
Can I ask you guys something?
Are you sure nothing's wrong?
You're always up to something
We'll think of something else
Tom said he'd found something
They're going to do something
They didn't offer me anything
There's something in this box
There's nothing we can do now
There's nothing more to drink
There's nothing more I can do
There's nothing left to drink
There's nothing in the fridge
There's nothing in the bucket
There's nothing I can do here
There's nothing else to drink
There's nothing else I can do
That's something I'd never do
That's not something I can do
So far, they've found nothing
Maybe we're missing something
It's not something we planned
I've done nothing exceptional
Aren't you scared of anything?
Aren't you afraid of anything?
Well, it's better than nothing
We shouldn't tell Tom anything
We aren't doing anything wrong
There's something under my bed
There's something troubling me
There's something strange here
There's something I need to do
There's nothing to stop us now
There's nothing to do but wait
There's nothing more we can do
There's nothing in this drawer
There's nothing in this closet
There's nothing funny going on
There's nothing else we can do
That's nothing to be sorry for
Look, there's nothing I can do
It's nothing worth considering
It's better than doing nothing
I've got something to give you
I'd like to eat something else
Finally, we agree on something
I won't let anybody hurt you
I didn't recognize the tune
I'd like you to sing a song
I should've kept my mouth shut
Thanks!
Do you want to buy them?
Yes.
How can I reach the hotel?
What do we live for?
Who do I live for?
What do I live for?
I should've done it by myself
You're very successful
I don't eat pork
When you smile, I am happy
Who broke it?
I'm from Kashgar
I'm going to live in Namibia
Where is Namibia?
You're right, I think
I've heard worse
Tom's starting to go bald
On the sea, we are victorious
Is this your phone?
Did you already do that?
I don't have a wife
I don't like anything here
Is the weed on the show real?
Well, what do you think?
Why are you so mysterious?
I'll take some of that
He's just like you
She's just like you
Where are the forks?
He doesn't have any freckles
It's gotten cold
There's no reason to complain
Where are the suitcases?
He's dishonest
She's dishonest
Do you have eggs?
Yes, in a nutshell.
It's to your advantage
Think about it, Tom
What do you really want?
Aaah..
Would you like a free sample?
I couldn't sleep well
I don't think that's fair
Sorry, I can't
Honey, I'm sorry
I'm 99% sure it's true
Beware!
Tom didn't seem that happy
I'd like to go on an adventure
Who has initiated this?
Cooee!
Can you hear me?
Where is the kitchen?
Don't you dare leave me!
He's my dad
Heads up!
You don't disturb me
No one will ever believe that.
Well, Tom believed me.
What happened?
I'm sad about life.
I don't know what hatred means
It'll be over soon
Don't tell Tom
He'll tell everyone
Don't tell her
She'll tell everyone
I'm keeping the baby
I don't want everyone to know
Tom knows.
He does?
Did you tell him?
Tom knows.
He does?
Did you tell him?
No, he found out by himself.
I didn't tell him
I didn't tell her
He's the man I told you about
Tom's friends were mean to him
They're just jealous
You're smarter than that
I'd like to say a few words
You're not different
You're perfect the way you are
Don't you ever do that!
Where are we going?
Somewhere safe.
You don't know what it's like
Oh my God, Mary, are you okay?
Why would I be jealous?
Are you interrogating me?
Why don't we go for a walk?
You traitor!
Tom didn't come to my wedding
I needn't buy a car
Why did you go home?
Tom, please just shut up
Shut up, Tom
You're ruining everything!
Will you please just shut up?
Stop now or I'll scream!
Stop it or I'll scream!
I'm dying
He'll be arriving any moment
They'll be arriving any moment
I don't care
I'm hungry
Do you have a light beer?
I'm not taking anyone's side.
Cats are natural-born hunters
Promise me you won't go
He's not worth it
Tom, what's wrong?
No one will ever believe that.
Well, Tom believed it.
Please just calm down, okay?
He's totally ignoring me
She's totally ignoring me
I knew you'd be mad at me
Don't do that ever again!
Don't take that tone with me
That's not fair
That's it!
I've had it with you two
Stop spinning in that chair!
Tom, clean your room.
I'll do it later.
Tom, go clean your room.
Can't I do it later?
Did you clean your room?
I'll do it later.
You're not my real sister
You were adopted.
That's not true!
I don't know anyone like that
I swear, Tom
I was just talking to him.
Talking to him about what?
I was just talking to him.
Talking to him about what?
That's none of your business.
Do you believe in angels?
I don't know anybody here
I was just asking a question.
Mind your own business.
Whaat?
No, of course not
How could I forget?
It's just so "her"!
Busy as usual?
I'd rather read
How tall is she?
It's very high
She's very tall
I didn't know Tom had a sister
I was just talking to Tom.
About what?
About what Mary did.
Houston, we have a problem
Do you see anyone here?
He didn't do it
She didn't do it
Let's eat somewhere else
Who else do you want to visit?
Who else was at the party?
Who else is going with us?
It's dark in this room
What am I to do with him?
Employ him?
And what did you do then?
Does Mary really love me?
I was talking with Tom.
About what?
About what Mary did.
I don't drink their water
Why is she with this idiot?
He's not gifted at sports
That's a tricky question
Tom takes the lead!
Is he still single?
Is she still single?
You're drunk, Tom
Stop trying to control me!
I'm sorry
I shouldn't have started it
You're drunk, Tom
We're going home
I'll pick you up at six
It's late
It's late and you're drunk
This time, I really mean it
Is it June already?
You're so full of it
Tom, please leave me alone
Do you sell a lot of those?
Do you want to take one?
Are you waiting for someone?
I'm a mess
Are you also German?
I'm glad you came today
Let's try to not do the work
I'm an Uyghur
It's bigoted idiots with power
Look at that boy!
Which boy?
Would you give me the book?
You call that dancing?!
Can city-boys plough?
Tom, wake up!
We're late!
And how do you explain this?
Tom, come here and sit with me
You dragged me into this!
No, Tom, don't do that
Leave me alone, Tom
You're drunk
Why don't you ask him?
Why don't you ask her?
Fine, Tom
Tom, this is Mary
Where are you?
It's a tourist trap
Do you like it?
Do you find him attractive?
Do you find her attractive?
And what do I do?
Just stand there and watch.
But what if we get caught?
Hold on a minute, Tom
What is going on here?
Get out here, fast!
Get out here, fast!
You'll be entirely on your own
It's getting late
Tom's not in hospital
Have you visited Tokyo Tower?
Does it have any sense?
I pretended that I didn't care
Why are squirrels so cute?
Tom, don't worry
I'm alright
Tom?
Hello?
Why can't I be pretty, too?
How's your shoulder?
So, what happened to Tom?
He disappeared.
Reeeally?
I'm proud to be a Quebecker
Are all doctors healthy?
Can I get a picture?
That's a nice picture
That's an old picture
Here's a picture of me
That's a great picture
Here's a picture of Tom
I'll send you a picture
That's a pretty picture
Tom took Mary's picture
Let's take some pictures
Tom isn't in this picture
Can I see a picture of Tom?
Shall I draw you a picture?
Tom tore Mary's picture up
Can I have the picture back?
Here's a picture of my baby
That's a good picture of Tom
Tom showed me Mary's picture
It's not a pretty picture
Is Tom in the picture?
That's hard to picture
I can't picture Tom in a dress
Can you picture it?
OK, I get the picture
That's a horrible thing to say
It's very sexy
Did you just call me fat?
They're talking about you
They're talking about you, Tom
Can I have my job back?
They sat in a semi-circle
He's in the zone
You have a poor memory!
You hear voices in your head?
Yes, demonic voices.
What happened to the girl?
Today, here and now
Tom's fat, isn't he?
That's a big fat lie
That's why I'm so fat
I'm pretty sure Tom's fat
You think I'm fat, don't you?
I wasn't fat when I was a kid
She's not perfect
She isn't perfect
I'd like a camomile
Don't mince words
Have you heard from Tom yet?
Let's skip dessert
Let's stick to the plan
You'll have a great time

We're the first ones to arrive
We're the last ones to arrive
We're just looking around
We're done playing around
We're just joking around
We're all going to die anyway
We're hoping Tom's still alive
We're lucky to still be alive
We're pretty much in agreement
We're just about the same age
We're going out again
We're leaving this afternoon
I don't need a shoeshine
I wasn't driving fast
I wasn't driving all that fast
I wish you'd slow down
Don't drive so fast
I've seen her naked before
I've seen him naked before
We'll get you squared away
I'm not helping you with this
I won't help you with this
I'll bring it back tomorrow
We'll wait until 2:30
We'll see you at 2:30
We'll have breakfast at 6:30
We'll call you if we need you
We'll know where to find you
We'll get in touch with you
We'll get right back to you
We'll be right behind you
We'll do fine without you
We'll be waiting for you
We'll never forget you
We'll take care of you
We'll catch up to you
We'll get back to you
We'll just follow you
We'll be seeing you
We'll come with you
We'll catch you
We'll see you next week
We'll drop Tom off on the way
We'll drop you off on the way
We'll fill you in on the way
We'll pick Tom up on the way
We'll settle it our own way
We'll just be in Tom's way
We'll think of another way
We'll stop along the way
We'll find another way
We'll try it your way
We'll find a way
We'll take a vote
We'll load the van
We'll take Tom with us
We'll take it with us
We'll clear this up
We'll take the truck
We'll have to leave town
We'll see you later tonight
We'll be back tonight
We'll come by tonight
We'll see the exhibit tomorrow
We'll go on a picnic tomorrow
We'll sort this out tomorrow
We'll see you guys tomorrow

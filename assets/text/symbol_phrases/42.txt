I'm hoping Tom can help us
When should I leave?
Did you hear that?
What was it?
That's Tom's younger sister
Tom's hair was wet
Nibble and gnaw like a mouse!
Let's hide inside this cave
Actually, I was joking
Actually, it was a joke
Why wouldn't Tom help Mary?
Where's your tricycle?
Tom was a freshman in 2013
I'm becoming a crazy cat lady
That's uncharacteristic of Tom
Tom's dad was in the IRA
I can fend for myself, Tom
I won't need this today
Can you keep up with me?
Throw in!
I've never seen Tom juggle
Where are the teaspoons?
Tom'll keep it for now
It's a poem
Mary's good at math
You're quite a teacher
Tom's wife is half his age
It's time to set the table
Can this be changed?
Did Tom give you a ride?

She's pretty either way
Mary doesn't need makeup
Can you call me tomorrow?
What will the new year bring?

I'm a vegetarian.
Who invented gunpowder?
Could you go down there?
The store wasn't very crowded
Tom wasn't in love with Mary
Do you know for sure?
What's on your mind now?
Tears welled up in Tom's eyes
You just crushed Tom's dream
You'll never see me coming
I'm everywhere
When will this go on sale?
I'm calm in my office
I'm calm in my study
Why's Tom not here?
I'm sorry for my weird French
Where's the pizza?
I'm on the lookout for you
The weather's terrible

How does this relate to Islam?
Do you eat watermelon?
Do you eat watermelons?
I'm subscribed to Amazon
I'm taking a shower
I'm going to shower
I'm showering
My futon's gone
This isn't a bad option
It's very humid in Japan
Those are Tom's parents
Tom!
I'm so glad you're safe!
I owe you one, Scott
I'm taking command
I'm super worn-out
I've just had a little nap
Do you admit your guilt?
I'll ask Tom to stay
Can you weave baskets?
It's very crowded here
Read the instructions.
It's so easy to weave a basket

What can I do to learn Berber?
Yanni isn't learning Berber
Why can't I stay here?
What is your favorite opening?
Are you warming up to me?
This isn't very helpful
Should I stay or leave?
You can't go there alone
I don't need to go out
I don't need to leave
Let's go to the market
Why do you want to be popular?
They're opening the box
You're covering your baby
We want to eat, but not here
Creatures are God's dreams
Even "my monkey ran away
Did Tom tell you what he saw?
It's really very pretty!
Don't touch my orchids, please
Please don't touch my orchids
Who'll stay here?
I wanted to, but I couldn't
I'm all grown-up now
Goodbye, 2016

What a wonderful slogan!

Is it usually this hot here?
Oh, with Tom?
It's totally a hoax
This is the e-mail
No mischief!

We'll make a towering statue

It's a strange addiction
Let's just stay down here
She can't stay alone
Is it usually this cold here?
There's no other way
Did Tom tell you that himself?
What kind of question is that?
You'd best not do that
He doesn't know where I live
Do you really like him?
Don't try to reform me
That'll take a few hours
That'll take several hours
That'll take quite a few hours
You can't tell anyone
I promise I won't tell anyone
How's life going for you?
That hasn't been proven yet
Whose motorcycle is this?
Don't wake me up so suddenly

I'm going to fire my lawyer
What you grinning at?
They're a happy family
What are your favorite dishes?
Have you got a double bed?
He has a slim, athletic build

You can't stay there
He's confined in the hospital
He says I'm his
He's suffering for some reason
He'd end up in prison
I'm losing my faith
Everyone's almost here
That's a pretty cool idea
This isn't encouraging
Tell me I'm dreaming
Everyone loves McDonald's
I'm not good with apologies
I'm not good with children
I'm not good with this stuff
Our dog isn't good with kids
That's Tom's step-mother
I'm not good with figures

We need to do that soon.
How soon?
Why would we do that?

I don't want to show off
You're a try-hard
I wouldn't care either way

Odd, but who cared?
Why's Mary crying?
Which tool should I use?
What did you eat today?

Why should I go there?
If you want me to, I'll come

Who's God?
Allah is everyone's god
Do you hate your mother?
That's a beaver dam

How old is this palace?
No, what's that?
You mean even this pillow?
It's kind of Animistic.

I’m a syncretist.
What's that?
I'm an eclectic
Oh, how uncanny!
It works for me!
Will I be released soon?
Why haven't you left yet?
Can we change subjects now?
I'm not talking about this.
What's this tool used for?
I decided that I'd stay
See what you've done
Has Tom returned yet?
Tom didn't run away
Why do you need a gun?
Shall we say goodbye?
You'll be compensated
Is the campsite far from here?
This is my mom's book
It's not on my way
Say you aren't kidding
What if they saw us?
Is this really serious?
She's not waiting for me
Is rust a form of wear?
That's actually the intention
Where should I go now?
Let's be optimists
What's behind this?
What is that building?
It's a theater.
What are they trying to say?
That'll hurt a lot
We'll have to work hard
Let's stay for the show
The path dead-ends up ahead
I haven't let any place
No, it's not like this
When did they go with you?
Tom is dating John's ex-wife
What a beautiful day today!

Tom, can you help me?
We're all non-smokers
Why did you post this?
Do you like crossword puzzles?
Don't be so upset
OK, what do you suggest?
It's hard for me to explain.
I think I understand.
You're smart!
Wow, it sounds fancy!
Wow, that's so cool!
Oh, that sounds marvellous!
They met in France.
Okay, I will.
That one isn't better
What prefecture are you from?
Pour me one too, please
Do children have to work?
We aren't allowed in there
It'll do you good
Why can't we stay here?
Why should I stop now?
You're childishly naive
Tom didn't have any friends
This car is brand-new
Do you have a decent suit?
Call Yanni.
Sorry, no signal.
I don't have a signal
Were you able to beat Tom?
Did you get to beat Tom?
Did you manage to beat Tom?
Can I get started?
Is that what you wanted?
Well, how does it help?
I'm not good
What if they think I'm stupid?
No, I wouldn't say that
Let's go on our bicycles
How long is that snake?

In Algeria, we don't do that
Why are you quarreling?
There's no more fish
Tom is my great-grandson
Why did you remain silent?
Let's go to the river
Go on and tell her, idiot!
Tell her, you idiot!
You're not much of an artist
Tom is a man, not a boy
Tom isn't my grandfather
Weigh it for me, please
Tom is a boy, not a man
Mary is a woman, not a girl
Oh, ye of little faith!
Do you have a candy bar?
Do you have a reserved seat?
Oh, I forgot to buy natto
Well, are we staying?
Tom is a Canadian, too
Should I take this job?
Even I don't know that
You shouldn't overdo it
What will you do first?
You're a happy person
Let's go see a ballet
Renkon, where were you born?
I was born on Barsoom, Mars
My mother was from Triton.
Have you?
Tom didn't want to leave Mary
OK, I agree with you
You're here again, Tom?
Is that what we want?
Of course, I'll fix that
Did you buy potatoes?
Tom is a new student, too
I don't live in Boston either
My name isn't even Tom
My name isn't Tom either
I don't even live in Boston
What can I do with it?
Why do you need so much?
Tom is stupid, but he's cute
We're off to a great start
Does that concern you?
Have a good flight!
Besides, we're used to it
Alexa's a cop
I use the "Firefox" browser
How will this help me?
Do you know where to go?
He's almost two meters tall
Why are you so curious?
I'd like half board
Can I have a little sip?
You're seriously wrong
Tom is rather good-natured
Don't waste your energy
Come here, my friend
You're in Brazil
Do you sell hammers?
Tom can't whistle at all
Didn't that surprise you?
I do it every five years.
What a boring job!
Sorry, but I can't go
How did Tom make his fortune?
Which ones do you like?
I don't like being copied
I'll think about it again
Tomorrow I'll be gone
Not you, Tom
I'd better stay silent
Do you want to be a star?
Where is it now?
Do you need to go today?
Tom knew he'd done wrong
Here, what Tom says goes
What Tom says doesn't matter
Is she doing better?
Is she feeling better?
You're too hot-tempered
What a terrible way to die!
He's right-wing in the extreme
Are you always so pale?
Do you like couscous ?
Do you play tennis ?
It’s a long trip
Did you make coffee ?
Is the food ready ?
Is lunch ready ?
It’s karma
I mixed up milk !
Have nice dreams!
Will we ever meet again?
I thought you were Hispanic.
No, I’m Iranian.
Will Tom come with us?
Did you buy butter?
It’s over!
There we go agin!

I’ve no more to say
Turn the radio on, please
I plan to go to Tom's party
Are the microphones off?
It didn't make me laugh
We don't eat red meat
Have you seen my file?
Has everyone caught up?
Were there fruits, Meron?
Has everybody caught up?
Yeah, Meron, I have.
Is it raining in Boston?
Today I'll leave early
Where's my piggy bank?
Tom's friend's name is Mary
Why don't you just sit down?
Why's the cat meowing?
Where did I put my bag?
Why's everyone scared?
Who bit you?
It's very hot outside
I'd prefer to be alone
Did you leave together?
Tom doesn't like anchovies
That doesn't work well
Is math easy for you?
When will it get warmer?
I've just had a nap
Tom doesn't care about you
Why did you even come?
It's a strange world
Yanni's boss was indeed a jerk
Yanni didn't take that well
Yanni's boss is mean
Where are Yanni's parents?
Yanni's store is closing
We're at a standstill
Yanni dumped Skura's body
The crime scene wasn't secured
Yanni gave Skura 400 dinars
Drugs ruined Yanni's life
Drug use derailed Yanni's life
Are you both Canadians?
Yanni knew Skura's major
When will they go?
Yanni's legs were tied
Yanni's clothes were clean
We didn't discuss that
This isn't enough for me
Yanni couldn't buy an Xbox
Yanni has a high-pitched voice
What was the alternative?
Yanni's ego was soaring
Yanni stole his parents' money
Happy Buy Nothing Day!
Yanni's lights are on
Yanni couldn't see who it was
Yanni's camera isn't charged
In fact, it was barely a road
What was in that bag?
Yanni knew Skura's name
Yanni isn't a stranger anymore
Yanni's car was empty
Tom doesn't know a lot yet
Do you think I'm unfair?
That's not why I'm late
Who told you about it?
I don't like being stared at
When did Tom leave?
He left at 2:30.
How fast do you read?
We're pastors
Is it cold in Boston?
Could you lend me a pen?
Is that allowed here?
Tom isn't good at fishing
Is Tom going to come with us?
Are you feminists?
Where are the batteries?
Of course, you're right
What a beautiful memory!
You're not my boyfriend
Can't you open the door?
Tom's a real closet case
Tom didn't loosen his grip
It's time to neuter the cat
Who ate my sandwich?
It's a moot point
It's not freeware
Finally, some new blood
Tom thinks he's the Messiah
We should've kept it a secret
Have you recovered completely?
Now I'm flabbergasted
It doesn't involve Tom
He goes to Iɣṛem
I am driving to Asif n Ɣiṛ
Are you driving to Buxlifa?
Where does Tom live?
He lives in Boston.
Don't remind me!
This is what we'll do
It's all thanks to you
You've disappointed me
Tom believes he's the Messiah
Were you there too?
Have you been there too?
Do you still play darts?
Tom's hedgehog is so cute!
Tom's on TV!
What should I do with these?
Will you talk to me now?
I'm going to talk to Tom today

Would you like me to do that?
And what exactly?
You do know.
No, I don't.
That.
What's cardiology?
I'd like one of each, please
Do they have any plan B?

Seriously?
You can't fix everything
These numbers aren't right
Because of this, Tom left
Because of that, Tom left
Here's why Tom left
Here's the reason Tom left
Are there gay fish?
Why should I consider this?
Don't buy any more candy
I didn't have that choice
Are you the last one?
I won't let anybody in
You might've been seen
We haven't made much progress
Did you find that funny?
Tom didn't look sad at all
Frankly, I'm surprised
When did Tom leave?
He left on Monday.
Who took my pens?
Don't let them hurt you
There's somebody in the pool
What if Tom isn't at home?
OK, I'll think about it
Tom didn't notice the wind
Tom didn't call the doctor
We won't finish this today
Honestly, I don't know
Ask Tom what he'll drink
Why are you up?
Tom didn't say he was leaving
Where's the nearest ATM?
Consider why you're here
Why are you so confused?
Don't scare the kids
Do you know these girls?
Have you caught anything?
What's causing that noise?
Is it cold in Boston now?
Tom doesn't believe anybody
What if it doesn't work?
Tom doesn't believe anyone
Do you know how Tom got in?
We don't have a dress code
Are these your parents?
Mary isn't my mother-in-law
How did these eggs get broken?
Are both of you Canadians?
Where's the locker room?
These eggs are soft-boiled
We're perfectionists
Tom isn't like his parents
We're in here
Tom doesn't drink cold tea
Why do you need all this?
Why didn't you eat breakfast?
Don't make things worse
Where did you bring me?
I wish that you had called me!
Can you do it yourself?
Is it hot in Boston?
What fantastic luck!
Why don't we buy one of those?
You went to Mary?
Mary's first boyfriend was Tom
They're funny
We didn't see this coming
Tom and I aren't alike at all
The past can't be changed
Who's Tom rehearsing with?
Are we still friends?
Are you still cleaning?
Where did Tom go?
He went to Boston.
Is anyone alive here?
Why are you giving up so soon?
Can your dog swim?
It's beautiful
Everything is upside down!
I can't go to school today
Are you really from here?
Why did you come to Malaysia?
Let's rent a car
Do these shoes fit you?
You're still too young
When will you do this?
I won't go back home
Is it hot in Boston now?
That's the North Star
I'm ready to abandon my post
Did you feed the dogs?
Whose birthday is it today?
Can you wait a little bit?
I never fucked up that yet.
How can we reduce costs?
This is not a game!
What do the trees whisper?
We'd better not leave now
Tom wouldn't go out with us
You're very gullible
We're all very scared
Have you been threatened?
What a liar!
What a silly question!
Tom saw Mary, and so did John
Does he know him?
I've got to go!
Tom's friend's name was Mary
Can you do magic tricks?
Where's the game?
They're euphoric
These aren't new
I'm unsure what Tom wants
Why don't we leave early?
I don't even remember!
Do you know my brother?
There's no place to sit
I was born 82 years ago
That hasn't been done yet
Is it difficult for you?
How can we allow this?
Do you know the password?
Perhaps we'll meet soon
Don't they trust you?
I don’t hate you anymore
Is it snowing in Boston?
No, that's not true!
Tom forgot Mary's name
We've made a bad mistake
Can you suggest a solution?
That's the Big Dipper
Who gave you these apples?
How can we get one of those?
Shavua tov!
Who said you could stop?
What do mean, Marko?
Oh, I never thought about it.
Sorry, Marko!
Did you buy this today?
Is Meat Loaf dead?
Don't start too soon
Mary has Hashimoto's
You can't live on Venus
Who invented binoculars?
Tom won't do that for us
Do you believe in omens?
Tom wouldn't do that for free
We won't be forgotten
We won't be forgiven
This can't be forgiven
This can't be forgotten
What else do you say?
Let's go play soccer
Are you a senior or a junior?
Tom's car needs to be washed
Tom didn't want it anymore
Tom didn't like this photo
Are you my friend or not?
Frankly, Tom is a bit dim
That's the reason Tom left
I thought you'd quit drinking
Could you carry this for me?
It's OK, Tom
You're safe now
Tom won't likely forgive us
Tom probably won't forgive us
We'll come to visit you
Tom isn't very sympathetic
That wouldn't surprise us
Tom is a part-time student
I didn't force Tom to do that
Is there a doctor here?
How much will everything be?
It'll be thirteen dollars."
It'll be thirteen dollars."
Did something happen to me?
I can't remember a thing
There's someone in the pool
We don't need it now
This drink tastes like pee!
Someone might've seen you
Somebody might've seen you
You guys are disgusting!
Did you tell me the truth?
I wish I’d told her not to go
What's in the middle drawer?
Don't let anyone in here
Who was Tom threatened by?
Where's my cell phone?
Can I return home?
You're my daughter
I love you.
Yanni's nervousness faded
We'll pay you well
Yanni's breath reeked of booze
Where's my fountain pen?
It's good that Tom isn't here
I'm not angry at you
Yanni's options have run out
Are you older or younger?
Are those Tom's suitcases?
Nobody laughed at Tom's joke
I won't support such a thing
Tom doesn't like dogs at all
Do you want the same?
You aren't as lucky as Tom is
She's Swiss
Is she a teacher?
Tom said he can't wait long
In fact, it is not unusual
Wow, what a coincidence!
Let's get out of here
We meet at last!
Everybody liked Tom's optimism
What can I do there?
What is your strategy?
Alex goes by he/him pronouns?
Ahh Tom, you got the job!
I'm so proud of you!
What's our game plan?
Filial piety, 2
Everybody out!
Stay alert!
Cash or check?
The weather's been nice so far
That'd surprise me
What storey is our room?
You owe me one, Tom
We're done for
What a big storm!
A hurricane's coming soon
What torments you?
We're always short on money
Where's this from, my girl?
Where is Tom's body now?
In the morgue.
Do you sell strawberries?
Did you water the flowers?
Did you draw that yourself?
Other Tom.
Is Tom's French good?
She didn't pass the test
Will you come back later?
Oh, I have no idea!
Tom's father passed away
What was going on there?
He's a talented adolescent
Do you accept my terms?
At least, that's what Tom says
What beautiful orchids!
Will that really happen?
You aren't kidding, are you?
It's not too late to save Tom
You won't be spared!
He's dumber than you
Which painting is small?
Don't speak till spoken to
Even cake shops are closed!
Who let you return!
Don't bother me!
Obviously, Tom had no proof
You two bored foetuses!
That's really good!
That sounds really weird!
Hold on!
Success is close!
Don't you dare lie to me
You're just like a fool!
Do it, no matter how hard!
Yanni wasn't from the area
Yanni's company didn't exist
It's late
Yanni didn't feel comfortable
Actually, it must end
Yanni didn't use a flashlight
Yanni isn't here for the money
He's here for experience
Tom doesn't believe me anymore
Can I get you some more?
Can you read them, Marko?
That's not Tom in this picture
Beijing Duck, now, isn't it?
I don't know...
Are you sure it's them?
I'm looking for a new player
Who did Tom cheat this time?
That isn't a bad option
Well, it's time to go
I ignored Tom's remarks
What shall I tell him?
Are you happily married?
Tom doesn't have bad grades
Do your legs hurt?
Does anyone else feel hot?
Do you feel hot?
Tom wouldn't tell me
Let's be calm, people
Who's your running mate?
Tom did this, not that
I have pictures of Tom's wife
Where did you buy those socks?
We're ahead again
Who's coming to the party?
Dennis, it's xenophobia!
I know, Marko
Please have a seat!
How can I help you?
It's all on the house!
Were you really scared?
Why?
Are those Tom's glasses?
Did he drop any good loot?
I'm fed up with lies
Tom doesn't meditate at all
I'm a company administrator
Who gave you these sunglasses?
Adjectives end in the vowel "a
It's cold in my room
She doesn't deserve that
Life isn't just about work
He's a victim of a conspiracy
Why are you still doing this?
What are Tom's demands?
There's no such word
Do you have anyone in mind?
Let's speak Yiddish!
Are those Tom's dogs?
Did you find your parents?
Epstein didn't kill himself
Are you with us or not?
What's nanotechnology?
What a beautiful poem!
How could you lie to me?
There's no one with us
Does Tom always act like this?
Let's meet next week
Tom couldn't hide his concern
Why are you discouraged?
Tom isn't gay, I don't think
Tom isn't bi, I don't think
Tom isn't trans, I don't think
We haven't done it yet
Did you like that play?
Why, do you think, Marko?
It intimidates them.
You may be correct.
Dennis, practice meditation!
Don't be so sly.
Did you eat anything at all?
In what way, Marko?
I think you understand.
Where's the cabinet key?
Can you help me?
Sure, I can, Dennis.
Where can I get a live tiger?
What do you want, boy?
You can't always be lucky
Where's my flashlight?
What's that robotic voice?
I don't think I agree
We aren't shy
Who's in the lobby?
We're not foreigners
I'm so glad you're safe
I'm glad that you're safe
What do you have planned?
Who's the best player?
You don't seem to believe Tom
Who are your partners?
It is for advancing!
I'm in a hurry
Why's it so cold?
It is time to morph!
It wasn't so much fun
Tom doesn't look like a killer
Was the test difficult?
How can we lower costs?
I knew you'd be furious

I didn't weigh their bags
When did you hear about it?
I've not started yet
Do you want to make me happy?
Is love just a game for you?
It's a ghost town
Did they sign?
Thank you and goodbye!
I'm not too surprised
I can't find my keys!
I don't dare to contradict him
That wasn't his idea
Did you phone me?
I don't eat breakfast
Where did he have to go?
Congratulations!
You won't be right
How can we put up with that?
Oh, how beautiful!
Can they send me a brochure?
He wants to, she doesn't
You wouldn't dare
Are we going to succeed?
He'll look for another lawyer
Does that product still exist?
This is what I'm made of
She's eating fruit and bread
Why would she lie about that?
What is his character like?
This isn't a new development
How did you determine this?
You're an excellent detective
I'm a homicide detective
Tom's wife died in childbirth
We're dying of hunger here
This isn't worth dying for
Tom died on October 20th
Please don't let me die
I feel like I'm dying
It's not time to die
I'm glad no one died
Are you ready to die?
Are you going to die?
Do you drink diet soda?
I'm not going to disappear
I hope you aren't disappointed
That's why I was disappointed
I'm sure Tom is disappointed
I'm not disappointed in that
That's why I'm disappointed
How can you be disappointed?
It's OK to be disappointed
I'm extremely disappointed
We're pretty disappointed
That's very disappointing
It's pretty disappointing
We're very disappointed
Don't disappoint me now
Tom isn't to be disturbed
I can't keep it in
You can't just laugh it away
We haven't even discussed that
That's still up for discussion
That's already been discussed
Tom and I didn't discuss that
We haven't even discussed it
I can't really discuss that
We didn't even discuss it
There's a lot to discuss
What was discussed?
I love rain.
Maybe you do, but I don't.
Of course I do!
Have you ever used one?
Nah, I haven't.
It must be middle age..
It must be middle age..
I'm a geek, not a nerd!
Mom!
My dog won't stop snoring
I don't spread them on bread
I'm just not digging it today
Let's not and say we did!
What can I say?
I'm a bad mammer jammer
This is a hotel, not a brothel
How will you do that?
How much did we lose?
How many do you have?
How is Tom doing now?
How do you rank that?
How did you get that?
How did they do this?
How did they do that?
How can we do better?
Do we really need it?
Did you vote for Tom?
Did Tom win the race?
Did Tom get a chance?
Can we do this again?
Can this be done now?
What can we do next?
That didn't help us
It's not easy to do
I'm glad Tom did it
I'm glad I did that
I don't own a horse
I don't drive a car
I didn't eat enough
I didn't do my best
How do we help them?
How do we get there?
How did Tom move it?
Do we need Tom, too?
Where do we go now?
What help do I get?
What do you all do?
We aren't done yet
I don't walk a lot
I don't own a suit
I don't know my IQ
Can we do it again?
Can Tom do the job?
Why do we need it?
Which way do I go?
We didn't give up
We didn't do that
It's all I can do
I've got to do it
I'm able to do it
I can't do it yet
How much do I get?
Don't go away mad
I'm doing it now
How do we fix it?
How do I sign up?
How do I get one?
Do you eat a lot?
Are you done now?
Why do that now?
Don't lose that
What can it do?
It's relatively early
I'll have to do that
I'm ready to do that
That's how we did it
That's how you do it
Tom can't do the job
We can't do it again
We can't do that now
We won't do it again
We've done very well
What can I do better?
What more can you do?
Why can't we do both?
Why did they do this?
Why do you need that?
You don't need a gun
Did you all know that?
Do you feel safe here?
Do you miss your kids?
Do you need any money?
Do you still miss Tom?
How's Tom doing today?
I don't feel that way
I don't have any pain
I love what I'm doing
I'm doing pretty well
I'm glad Tom did that
I'm unable to do that
It didn't go too well
Let's see Tom do that
That's not easy to do
That's not what we do
Tom doesn't own a car
We don't want to move
We don't want to wait
We're able to do that
What do you miss most?
Why do people do this?
Why does Tom hate you?
Why don't you stop it?
You can't do that now
Do we really want that?
Do you think I'm funny?
Do you want a sandwich?
Don't give up too soon
Don't let Tom fool you
Don't tell me, show me
How did this all start?
How did you get to Boston?
How did you learn that?
How much does Tom make?
I didn't plan for this
I don't know the facts
I don't mind the noise
I don't need much else
I don't think it helps
I just don't have time
I still don't have one
I still don't want one
I think I've done well
I'll just do it myself
I'm just doing my duty
It's really hard to do
That's very hard to do
The job's not done yet
I'm not a man
I didn't come to be silent
Okay!
Do you all understand?
Obviously not!
Do you like snakes?
Obviously not.
Where is the butter?
Who says that I have a gun?
Who says that I steal money?
I don't know
Tom doesn't like his sandwich
Tom didn't speak to me
We don't need any more
We don't need to fight
We've done what we can
What did Tom give Mary?
What do you need today?
What'll you do with it?
Where did it all start?
Why does Tom need that?
Are you still in school?
Can it actually be done?
Can we do this together?
Did you feel safe there?
Do you have any regrets?
Does Tom really do that?
Don't be afraid to fail
Don't ever give up hope
Don't quit your day job
How did that all happen?
How did this effect you?
How does Tom make money?
I didn't even know that
I didn't read the story
I didn't think about it
I do think there's hope
I don't do that anymore
I don't do those things
I don't want to comment
I guess you didn't know
I honestly don't get it
I hope Tom doesn't mind
I like what you've done
I wish it didn't matter
Let's get this job done
Let's not do that again
That's what I did today
They don't want us here
Tom didn't get his wish
Tom didn't get the memo
Tom didn't grow up here
Tom didn't seem to mind
Tom didn't want my help
We don't always do that
We don't have any rules
We don't practice a lot
We don't sell junk food
What advice do you have?
What are we doing wrong?
What did the company do?
What do you enjoy doing?
What has Tom done wrong?
What should we focus on?
What'll Tom do about it?
Who doesn't want to win?
Why didn't they tell us?
Why didn't you hire Tom?
Why don't you go inside?
Why don't you want this?
Why don't you write Tom?
Are you still doing that?
Can you do this yourself?
Did you really mean that?
Do you guys use Facebook?
Do you like being famous?
Do you really need these?
Do you see a resemblance?
Do you still play tennis?
Can you drive a little faster?
I am dirty-blond
I protest!
What are you doing, darling?
Do you still write music?
Does Tom still live here?
Does Tom still work here?
Don't feel sorry for Tom
Don't let that worry you
How did Tom get involved?
How did this get started?
How much don't they know?
I didn't expect all this
I didn't like doing that
I don't have any regrets
I don't know what's best
I don't like working out
I don't really need that
I don't think about that
I don't think that works
I really just don't know
I'm not doing that today
It didn't need to happen
Our work here isn't done
Please don't let us down
That's not what Tom does
That's really hard to do
The fun didn't last long
They're doing a good job
Tom didn't say very much
Tom didn't talk too much
Tom didn't want us there
Tom doesn't plan to wait
Tom hasn't done that yet
Tom isn't quite done yet
Tom says he doesn't mind
Tom still doesn't get it
We didn't talk very much
We don't need that stuff
We don't really know why
We haven't done that yet
We just didn't do enough
We just didn't expect it
We'll always do our best
What did Tom actually do?
Why aren't we doing that?
Why isn't Tom doing this?
I don't like working here
I'm happy Tom is doing OK
Maybe Tom doesn't like me
That's what we have to do
I'm glad you're doing well
How much does that job pay?
I bet Tom didn't know that
What do we need to do next?
Why didn't you do anything?
Do you see any similarities?
I'm glad Tom didn't do that
What do we need to look for?
Are you still playing tennis?
Do you know anyone in Boston?
How did you learn to do that?
The meeting didn't last long
We really do need Tom's help
Why do you need one of those?
I don't ever go there anymore
I don't think you can do this
It's not difficult to do that
Why don't you want to do this?
Did Tom need help?
Are your feet cold?
What do you want, anyway?
What has Tom done lately?
Where do your folks live?
You'd better do that now
Can anything else be done?
Did I miss something here?
Do you guys understand me?
Do you have hard evidence?
Does Tom really want this?
I didn't even notice that
I don't feel safe anymore
I don't have any comments
I don't have any symptoms
I don't have many regrets
I don't know why, exactly
I don't like cold weather
I don't remember for sure
I don't remember that day
I think we're doing great
I'd be willing to do that
I'll do whatever you need done
It didn't make much sense
Tom didn't need much help
Tom doesn't plan to leave
We don't really feel safe
We don't think it matters
What do you suggest doing?
What else do you remember?
What exactly did you mean?
What exactly does it mean?
What exactly has Tom done?
I actually didn't say that
I didn't see anything else
Most people don't think so
Something's got to be done
That didn't help very much
That didn't used to happen
That's exactly what we did
Tom didn't even mention it
Tom didn't lose his temper
Are you learning English?
That didn't use to happen
You idiot!
I swear!
Capiche?
Tom didn't seem upset
Tom didn't want to comment
Tom doesn't like us either
Tom knows what we're doing
We don't need these things
We don't think that's true
We don't want that anymore
We don't want to overreact
What does it matter anyhow?
What does it really matter?
What you're doing is wrong
I'm too old to dance
Why does that interest you?
Why does this surprise you?
That's been done before
Did anyone else notice this?
Do you have any predictions?
Does Tom have anything left?
Exactly what does that mean?
I hope I didn't offend anyone
How does that actually work?
How does this always happen?
I certainly don't regret it
I didn't even recognize Tom
I didn't know what happened
I don't personally know Tom
I don't want that happening
I just don't understand Tom
I personally don't think so
I'm doing what I can
We haven't done too badly
It really doesn't seem fair
Let's do the exact opposite
Maybe you're doing it wrong
Personally, I don't like it
Some people don't like that
Some things didn't work out
That's all we've been doing
That's exactly what Tom did
That's what smart people do
That's what we're doing now
They can't do anything else
They're doing what they can
Tom didn't do anything else
Tom didn't move fast enough
Tom obviously doesn't get it
This doesn't happen every day
Tom doesn't owe us anything
We don't have any questions
We don't make many mistakes
We don't think it's serious
What difference did it make?
What's Tom doing these days?
Why do school grades matter?
Did anybody else notice this?
Did you expect anything else?
Do you like watching sports?
Do you have any disabilities?
Do you have trouble sleeping?
Does anyone see a difference?
I definitely don't regret it
I don't mind reading manuals
I don't think it's necessary
I'll do whatever I can
We'll do whatever we can
I didn't really enjoy that
We've been doing just fine
We've done the right thing
Tom didn't show me anything
We didn't do much yesterday
It's just doesn't seem right
That just doesn't make sense
That's something Tom must do
That's what Tom usually does
The article doesn't say that
They'll do whatever they can
They've done the right thing
Tom didn't do much yesterday
Tom didn't go into specifics
Tom definitely didn't do that
I don't think Tom is qualified
Where is my ring?
I don't give it to you
Valentine's Day is coming up
Let's hit the slopes!
Let's hit the slopes
I'm bored!
Then find something to do!
I'm not here to entertain you.
Why do you act so strangely?
Why isn't he here?
Why isn't she here?
How do you read and write?
Do you think he likes me?
Do you think she likes me?
I don't regret anything
We don't want your money
Your opinion doesn't matter
I don't trust anyone anymore
They're just doing their job
Tom doesn't know much either
Tom doesn't smoke cigarettes
Tom doesn't watch war movies
We didn't take anything home
We're not doing anything new
We've had success doing that
What does this mean, exactly?
You don't drink enough water
I didn't expect these results
I don't particularly like Tom
I don't think it's reasonable
I don't watch much basketball
I really didn't understand it
I really don't understand why
I still don't understand this
I'll probably stop doing that
I'm actually doing quite well
Some things just don't matter
That doesn't surprise me much
Things didn't happen that way
Tom didn't sit around waiting
Tom doesn't even like driving
Tom doesn't need a wheelchair
Tom hasn't made much progress
What do these statistics mean?
Don't leave the engine running
It doesn't happen much anymore
It doesn't make economic sense
That doesn't happen very often
They're doing it by themselves
This doesn't happen very often
Tom doesn't struggle like this
We don't have that information
We don't know what's happening
We don't make anything anymore
We don't want any distractions
Tom didn't promise me anything
You'll regret what you've done
You're probably doing it wrong
You don't look sick to me
Prices right now are sky-high
I didn't intend to say that
Look out world!
Here I come!
What's your spirit animal?
What is your totem animal?
Mary's apartment is very tidy
Don't worry so much!
Every day, you show up late
Just suck it up already!
I feel like I have to go pee!
Do you like your keyboard?
Do you need a new keyboard?
Why are you asking about that?
I don't want to start a fight
Is this a bad time to chat?
Why did Rome fall?
You'll be in shtuck
It's really stuck in there
Party at my house tonight!
Drinks on me!
Oh, that’s right!
She didn't tell me her name
I don't accept your arguments
Who is the fastest one here?
I'm kind of uncomfortable
We don't lack self-confidence
I wish I'd taken more pictures
I didn't sign anything
Where did Tom have to go?
Tom didn't hitchhike home
Tom just didn't understand
That's exactly what I'm doing
Tom didn't practice on Monday
Tom is kind of cute, isn't he?
We don't regret that decision
Will they play together again?
I don't regret quitting my job
Tom isn't doing anything wrong
Is this animal holy?
Don't listen to her!
Don't talk during class
School is for learning!
That's not a real word
Is that even a real word?
Was there ever any doubt?
Were you drinking that day?
Drinking isn't against the law
There's a two-drink minimum
Are you a taxi driver?
I hope Tom isn't driving
Tom won't drive at night
I'm going to drive downtown
Promise you'll drop by tonight
Is Tom able to eat?
We're going to eat now
I'm embarrassed for us both
How will it all end?
How will this all end?
When will it ever end?
Where will Tom end up?
We're at our wits' end
When will this all end?
Where will all this end?
The ending wasn't a surprise
We've endured for long enough
I've enjoyed working with Tom
There's no entrance fee
I'm excited to be here
There's a lot of excitement
There's excitement in the air
They're very excited about it
We're pretty excited about it
We're really excited about it
What's your excuse now?
Can you expand on that?
There's no room to expand
Here's what to expect
Were you expecting to win?
Is it what you expected?
What else can we expect?
That's all you can expect
I just wasn't expecting it
This isn't what we expected
This wasn't what I expected
Tom wasn't expected to live
Nobody's expecting us to win
I wasn't expecting that at all
What else were you expecting?
Who are you calling stupid?
Have you ever kissed a woman?
There is a hole in Jon's sock
I'm sorry
Are vampires real?
Did anyone eat with you?
Never touch this flask!
They've seen better days
I'm British born and bred
Stop that car!
Stop the car!
That's her car
Oh no!
So thin!
Are you dieting?
That isn't wine
It's grape juice
Wow!
You've lost weight
Are you on a diet?
Ow!
Stop it!
Well, this is the street!
It looks like that, huh?
But we've seen it before
Do you believe in ESP?
I really can't explain why
I'll explain it to you now
I can't face the truth
I'm not afraid to fail
We're going to have failures
I fear for Tom's safety
Tom's fears were well founded
We're feeling great
You'll feel at home
I feel like it's safe
I feel we're prepared
We feel we're the best
I'm not feeling relaxed
That's truly how I feel
Can you feel the tension?
I know that feeling, too
I'll never feel that way
It's a very nice feeling
I've never felt like that
That's my feeling as well
That's the feeling I have
I feel like I'm invincible
It's a pretty good feeling
It's a really good feeling
I'm feeling much better now
I'm feeling pretty good now
Now you've hurt my feelings
That's how I feel sometimes
I'm feeling very comfortable
I'll never forget that feeling
What was the fight over?
There's no need to fight
Tom's a very good fighter
You've got to keep fighting
We're fighting for our lives
What was the fight all about?
I can't figure it out
We've got it figured out
Tom can't figure it out
They'll get it figured out
I'm still figuring stuff out
What was the final score?
The court's decision is final
I'm not a financial expert
Tom isn't hard to find
Did you find your passport?
They'll never find you here
Let's try to find some shade
Let's try and find some shade
Tom isn't quite finished yet
Tom was fired in 2013
Tom is afraid he'll get fired
Bet he's read neither
I think I'm going to puke
We've got that figured out
Don't make me slap you
Do you like giving advice?
Should I prepare the coffee?
Ain't that just like me?
Who killed the spy?
Do you need an umbrella?
This is a stick-up!
We can't fish there anymore
We've got to fix it
I'm trying to fix it
I'm on a fixed income
Who can fix this mess?
You can't fix that now
I can't fix every problem
That's pretty easy to fix
It's difficult to find work
Do not do this!
I think I'm going to go now
He isn't afraid of anything
I don't go to work on Sundays
Mr. Smith has arrived
Who buys such art?
When do you usually go to bed?
What's the moral of the story?
You did it on purpose!
That'll be better
Why would you think like that?
How did you know this?
Could I turn off the light?
Where did you work?
Did Tom ever answer you?
Do you have some pencils?
I didn't do it for money
Tom didn't do it for money
I didn't do it for money
Where's Tom?
I don't know
How are you doing, Mike?
My name is Tom.
My name is not Tom!
Tom's mother told him a story
I'm just glad he wasn't hurt
I'm just glad she wasn't hurt
I'm just glad Tom wasn't hurt
They're not related
Yes, I will be your Valentine
Will you be my Valentine?
I'm just glad you weren't hurt
Sorry, I don't feel well
Sit down, please, and listen
Mary, please hug me
Did he really do that?
You couldn't make it up!
Don't get lost, please
I am naked!
Tom's schedule is insane
We won't be fooled again
We won't get fooled again
That's pretty hard to forget
I'm very frustrated
It's been very frustrating
It's incredibly frustrating
It's going to be frustrating
I'm the one that's frustrated
That must've been frustrating
Tom said he's also frustrated
It's getting to be frustrating
What have we really gained?
I'm getting thirsty
What's got into Tom?
We've got a good team
We've got to help out
What did we get wrong?
You've got me curious
I know I'm getting old
We've got a great team
We've got lots of time
It's going to get rough
I'm trying to get a tan
That's the best we have
They've got a good team
We're getting desperate
We're going to get that
We've got nowhere to go
We've got to get better
We've got what it takes
Who's got time for that?
I'll get you some brandy
I've got to learn French
That's how I got started
That's what got me upset
Get in the van, everybody
Is Tom getting any better?
We're going to get better
We've got a game tomorrow
You've got that all wrong
You've got to be yourself
We'll probably get married
We're getting a lot better
We're just getting started
We're trying to get better
You've got to take chances
I think we're getting better
Let's get our facts straight
Let's get the facts straight
We've got to start somewhere
What's that you've got there?
Where can I get one of those?
We'll get it right eventually
I'm getting stronger every day
Is it hot outside?
Hot outside?
Do we need special permission?
I can't give it up
I'm giving up on it
I can't give that up
I won't be giving up
I won't ever give up
I'll give that a try
There's no giving up
We'll give it a shot
I'd give it some time
Let's give that a try
I can't give that away
I'll give Tom a chance
You can't ever give up
You just can't give up
I wasn't given a choice
Let's give Tom a chance
You can't give that away
You can't give up trying
We weren't given a choice
We're never giving up hope
We're not about to give up
You've given me a headache
Eventually, Tom just gave up
I think I'll give that a try
They won't give you anything
They've simply given up hope
We weren't given a chance
I'm going up the stairs
I'm going down the stairs
I'm not stretching them
What souvenirs did you buy?
Let's stop!
I can't tell you my plans
So, I was right?
That's accurate enough
We can't do this alone
I'm glad Tom isn't here
Can I go home?
Is Tom ready to go?
I can't go tomorrow
I'm going to try it
Is it going to snow?
I'm glad Tom is gone
How's it going so far?
I'm going to have fun
I'm going to meet Tom
I'm going to need you
I'm not going to stay
Now we're ready to go
Tom isn't ready to go
Tom's not ready to go
We're ready to go now
Can't you just go away?
How fast was Tom going?
I'm going to work hard
It isn't going to snow
It's not going to snow
Let's go have some fun
There's a lot going on
Tom isn't going to win
We aren't going to win
Will my premiums go up?
You'd better go to bed
Everybody's ready to go
Tom won't go to college
We aren't going to lose
We're going to be ready
We're going to miss Tom
I wonder what's going on
I'm going to miss Boston
I'm going to protect you
I've quit going to clubs
Tell Tom what's going on
We'll go there next week
Where have we gone wrong?
Who knows where Tom went?
I'm going to keep singing
I'm going to keep working
We can't go anywhere else
We'll be ready to go soon
I'm not going to speculate
It's going to be difficult
It's going to happen again
Things won't go as planned
Tom isn't going to do that
We aren't going to do that
We're still planning to go
Who's going to replace Tom?
I'm going to miss you a lot
I'm not going to name names
We're going there next week
We're going to keep smiling
We're going to work tonight
Everyone's going to be tired
Is that going to happen soon?
It's not going to snow today
Nobody's going to rescue you
This can't possibly go wrong
We're going to be aggressive
We're going to work together
What's going to be different?
Where's all that money going?
I'm not going to get involved
Is Tom really going to Boston?
That's what's going to happen
There's nothing going on here
This problem isn't going away
Everyone knows what's going on
Everything's going to work out
Somebody's going to notice you
They're going to make mistakes
Hello, good people!
I haven't yet graduated
I'll take that for granted
We'll take that for granted
That's how I grew up
Do you still love me a little?
School isn't for me
Where is Rome?
That's torn it!
It's not usually this busy
How should I eat this?
There's nobody inside
It's within about two weeks
Get rid of such stupid ideas!
Watch out!
There's a car coming!
Watch out!
A car is coming!
Let's go someplace warm
Let's go somewhere warm
How do you eat this?
Tom's rather busy just now
Are reptiles a clade?
Tomorrow I'll buy what I need
Why do we have homework?
I'm studying several languages
It's technically possible
There's a lot at stake
I'm saving as much as I can
Mom's at work
You shouldn't be so prideful
Can I have your full name?
I'm so tired I could die
That's for sure
Are you older than Tom?
I don't watch TV very much
You!
In that car over there!
Stop!
I could do that in 10 minutes
You heard the news?
Is this a fact or an opinion?
Sorry to tell you that, mate
I'll buy what I need tomorrow
They're dimming the lights
Tom didn't admit his mistake
You are so annoying!
Is he alright?
Is Tom alright?
Is she alright?
Will you be going with us?
Tom is on the ship's deck
What did you grill?
Did you go to the store?
Can you show me another room?
I know what she's capable of
How's the job hunt going?
She's always been a hothead
I can't go even if I want to
Don't touch my sandwich!
I can't win
When does the boat set out?
Has she ever snored?
Has he ever snored?

Hi, honey!
It's me, Layla
I'm safe and I'm coming home
Love you, honey
Do you know I love you?
Did you kill your wife?
Don't let this man out
He's going to kill again
Layla's rejection enraged Sami
Layla went to Sami's house
Are you crying, sweetie?
I'm an undercover agent
I don't have any drugs on me
Stay down and don't move
Are you two ready to go?
Layla didn't say anything
Why is Layla doing this?
Layla's room smelt musty
Layla knew Sami's voice
We're so glad Layla is alive
We won't let them kill you
I'm gonna go get some help
They're not here for you
We're here to help Layla
Layla's hope is fading
Are you an interior decorator?
And I'm the 1 you need
Because you're hot
Do you have a Band-Aid?
Are you a camera?
Are you a magician?
Are you Google?
How about a workout?
Are you a parking ticket?
Was your dad a boxer?
'Cause you're a knockout!
When should we meet?
Was your dad a thief?
Are you scared?
Not a bit.
Tom's a stiff-necked old man
But I'm 55.
Don't worry
Most women mellow as they age.
I'm sorry, Layla
There's nothing we can do
You're a worthless husband
Can I see Sami?
No, you can't see him
He has already been cremated.
Who was that?
It's just a friend.
I'm Layla, Sami's wife
I'm Sami's wife.
You mean ex-wife.
I'm Sami's wife
Please don't call him again
Who is that?
How is the weather there?
It's nice.
You drink too much!
It's Sami
Scoundrel!
Layla wasn't just cunning
Why do they live here then?
Sami lived off Layla's salary
Layla answered Sami's ad
You're cheating on me
Layla didn't have friends
Stay with me, Layla
Stay with me, Layla
Please don't leave me
Stay with me, Layla
Please don't die
Layla's future looked bleak
I did not call you, but Tom
Will you show the way?
It wasn't me who called you
I didn't call you
We hope that you don't do that
I'll start doing that tomorrow
I wish that I hadn't done that
Come in, Layla
I can't tell you when
Layla didn't come back
Layla didn't scream
Layla can't do this
Layla can't give you this
Why did Layla take her purse?
What's your name, boy?
What's Layla's phone number?
Are we going to die?
I didn't say goodbye to my mom
That's what made me cry
Let's go see this movie
Sami was in Layla's bedroom
Layla caught Sami's eye
Layla couldn't resist flirting
Layla was heading Sami's way
Have I been shot?
Layla's purse was empty
I'm not going that way
Why is Layla still here?
Am I gonna die?
Don't leave me yet
Don't leave me yet, Layla
I'm not a people-pleaser
I moved here in 1990
What do they think about me?
How do I look like?
Who cares what people think?
Why was that happening?
Don't fall for his scam
Don't fall for her scam
He's trying to scam you
She's trying to scam you
It's a pyramid scheme
It's a get-rich-quick scheme
That industry shouldn't exist
I'm not a con artist
What's my password again?
What's the password again?
Do it, or I'll kill you
The password is 12345
The cab's here
The taxi's here
The garbage truck's here
Today, we ride into battle
It's a dragon
She's married
I think we're going to do that
I didn't feel ready to do that
Will we be allowed to do that?
It'll be very hard to do that
It'll be very easy to do that
I'm not ever going to do that
I'd like to know who did that
I think you shouldn't do that
I think I'll enjoy doing that
Do you want us to do that now?
He's hard to satisfy
Get up, Mary
Tom's father left his family
Beware!
It's cold, I must take a coat
Stop!
Where are you from?
I come from England.
I'm your father's colleague
May I introduce myself?
It's my glass
Stop dreaming and help me!
That was 2 points
Oh, yeah?
Did Tom force you to do that?
Could we try to do that again?
Aren't you sorry you did that?
Aren't you allowed to do that?
Why won't you do that for me?
We should've done this earlier
Who asked you not to do that?
Sooner or later, everyone dies
They wouldn't let me do that
I'm not going to do that now
I've been really tired all day
I wish that I hadn't said that
I don't plan to ever do that
I think we've been cooperative
I don't plan to do that today
I don't plan to do that here
Don't you want me to do that?
I think that'll happen someday
I think that'll change one day
Can you try doing that again?
I think it'll be a busy winter
Can you do that or can't you?
Would you like to work for us?
Are you the one who did that?
Would you like to hear a joke?
You didn't do that, did you?
Would you like to go together?
You can't do that in Boston
We don't know what's going on
Who told you not to do that?
It won't be hard to do that
That won't be difficult to do
I wasn't allowed to do that
I wish that I weren't married
Could we do that once again?
I was told to be here by 2:30
Can we try doing that again?
Aren't you still doing that?
I think I'll enjoy being here
Yesterday, Tom studied all day
Were you forced to do that?
I won't ever do that again
Are you sorry you did that?

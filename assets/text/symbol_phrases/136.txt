It's her first day at school
That's a lot of money
Don't do something stupid
I'd like to try it on
I'd like to try this dress on
I think we're getting close
We don't take credit cards
Are you surprised?
Are you scared of me?
I'll send you a postcard
Don't step on my toes
In the desert, I think

She's aggressive
Just do what you're told
This isn't my responsibility
It's yours
Have you told him yet?

I've never actually been alone
It's great to finally be alone
Maybe Tom wasn't working alone
We're going to leave you alone
I'm here as a tourist
I don't work on Sundays
Did you decide?
Do you like Italian?
Do you dye your hair?
I don't want to sell my soul
It's a fast growing city
Keep it simple, stupid
Don't get any stupid ideas
Okay, I'm ready
He's a food critic
Whose idea was this?
They're a big, happy family
I want a big, happy family.
How big?
He doesn't have a family

He's buying apples
I don't talk to Tom anymore
She's trying on a coat
I don't talk to them anymore
Tom doesn't talk to me anymore
They're in math class
Why don't you come over?

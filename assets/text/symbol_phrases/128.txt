Stop!
You're making me cry
Stop!
You're making her cry
Stop!
You're making him cry
Stop!
Stop!
There's a deer on the road
You're making me blush
I don't want to stop
I can't stop
The brakes..
You're addicted
You're addicted
You're addicted
You're addicted
I'm too old for you
I'm too old for her
I'm too old for him
She's too old for you
He's too old for you
She's too old for him
He's too old for her
She's too old for me
He's too old for me
You're too old for me
Stop!
You're hurting her!
She's a keeper
It's a personal matter
Don't give him any ideas
Don't give her any ideas
You don't need to explain
I'm not your son
I'm not your daughter
I'm not your father
I'm not your mother
Did you take her home?
Did you take him home?
I'm not your servant
You're a filthy liar!
He's a filthy liar
She's a filthy liar
What's the big deal?
He's both tall and fat
She's short, but fat
He's tall and slim
She's tall and slim
She's slim, but short
She's short and fat
She's tall and beautiful
He's tall and handsome
He's short and fat
I think I'm going to be sick
Don't come in!
I'm naked
Do you want to come in?
Tom doesn't even own a suit
She's a bodybuilder
He's a bodybuilder
That's not what I understand
That's not what I hear
And finally, you win
It's bad for the heart
Very romantic!
Believe in justice!
Believe in luck!
Believe in science!
Believe in love!
I'm absolutely sure
It's a song
This isn't silver
I think she's going to be sick
I think he's going to be sick
He's out of touch with reality
It's more fun than studying
He's wide awake
She's wide awake
I'm used to going to bed early
She's the one with a family
Their relationship isn't equal
She's very innocent
This is going to be epic!
You're a vandal!
Can you lend me some money?
I'm skint
Where can I get a vuvuzela?
If Tom can't do it, nobody can
Why are you upset?
Everyone knows you're rich
It's chillier today
We can beat her!
What happened?
Who's this hot babe?
You're a doll!
She's a hottie
I'm not a nerd!
You're a nerd
He's a nerd
She's a nerd
He's hiding in the closet
She's hiding in the closet
They're hiding in the closet
I'm fascinated by cats
They're hiding in the woods
How dare you insult my sister!
The news can't all be bad
It's no use being so sad
It's no use complaining
It's no use kidding myself
It's no use talking to Tom
Things can't be all that bad
Can we just drop it?
I'm older than you
Therefore, enjoy every day!
You can't abandon Tom
We can't accept all of these
We can't accept all of this
I can't accept this, Tom
We can't accept this
We can't act without thinking
You can't address me like that
Tom can't afford a lawyer
I can't afford a pay cut

I can't trust Tom
I can't trust you anymore
I can't trust you
I can't understand
I can't use it
We can't use this
I can't wait another week
We can't wait any longer
Tom can't wait for Mary
We can't wait for Tom
I can't wait forever
We can't wait much longer
I can't wait that long
I can't wait to be a father
I can't wait to be married
I can't wait to get home
Tom can't wait to get married
I can't wait to leave
Tom can't wait to meet you
Tom can't wait to see you
I can't wait too much longer
We can't wait two weeks
I can't wait until tomorrow
This can't wait
Tom can't wait
You can't walk away from this
I can't walk in these shoes
I can't walk
We can't waste any more time
I can't watch
I can't wear those clothes
They don't fit
Tom can't whistle
You can't win all the time
We can't win
I can't work for you anymore
I can't work for you
I can't work like this
Tom can't work tonight
I can't work with Tom
You can't yell at me like that
You can't yell at Tom
What can't you do?
Let's not be too hasty
I don't have a pot to piss in
Stop being so bull-headed!
It can't wait
Can it wait?
I'm not finished with you
I'm not finished with him
I'm not finished with her
Tom's son is sick
Tom's daughter is sick
He's young and beautiful
She's young and beautiful
She didn't protest
He didn't protest
Don't let her escape!
Don't let him escape!
Don't let the cat escape
Close the door!
I don't like the look of him
I didn't mean to kill him
I didn't mean to hit him
I didn't mean to make him cry
I didn't mean to make her cry
It's a strip club for women
I'll cut your head off!
It's a one-time offer
She's a model
He's a model
She's a supermodel
I only do what I'm paid to do
I only hope we're not too late
I only hope you're right
I'm not Tom
I only weigh 45 kilograms
I didn't mean to hit her
What do you want from Tom?
What do you want to ask me?
What do you want to do now?
What do you want to give Tom?
What do you want to happen?
What do you want to hear?
What do you want to see?
What do you want to tell us?
What do you want to watch?
She's a lovely young girl
He's a lovely young man
She's a bit jealous
He's a bit jealous
He's our only suspect
He's crazy about me
He's crazy about her
She's crazy about me

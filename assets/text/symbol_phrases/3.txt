Tom and I've lost touch
There's no wriggling out of it
I accepted Tom's apology
I answered Tom's question
I'm afraid Tom might come
Curious, are we?
Patience, my dear!
The cap's got to be somewhere
Does anyone know where Tom is?
Yep.
And where is he?
That I don't know.
Why did you say yes, then?
Idiot!
Nan!
Tom's hair has grown back
You should've told me before.
Hey mate!
You got a second?
Yes, certainly
I have a lot to do!
Tom, it's been a long time!
Do you remember me?
Of course I do!
You're Mary!
That's right, isn't it?
So you do remember me!
I'm so glad!
It wasn't very cold last night
It's really hot outside today
I'll answer only one question
How did Boston get its name?
Would you fancy a cup?
I think that he's wrong
I won't go there without you
Tom isn't any older than me
Last night wasn't very cold
Meanwhile, it was getting dark
Good!
What do you actually think?
Disasters, however, did occur
Did you see my red shirt?
Unfortunately, no.
I think he's wrong
What if she leaves me again?
It's a nice view, isn't it?
That isn't Ido
That's not Ido
We're cooking shish kebabs
It's terribly hot in here
Tom's a junkie
Do I have talent?
Have I got talent?
What was wrong with that?
Tom wants to go and I do, too
Our team isn't very good
I turned down Tom's invitation
Do you see anything else?
Why have you shut the door?
It's really hot outside
I'm afraid that Tom might come
It's been warm all week
Who's eaten the cheese?
It's windy, isn't it?
Who's eaten all the cheese?
You shouldn't be outside
Why don't we try it?
Do you drink water?
You mustn't gain weight
You mustn't put on weight
It's terribly hot
What wasn't true?
I'm living alone
She's going to work alone
My son can't talk yet
I didn't eat breakfast
I didn't need any help
Would you care for tea?
How many boxes did you fill?
How did they do it?
May I have this one as well?
You aren't going to catch me
You don't need to go with me
Is Mary beautiful?
Goodbye, Tatoeba
He'll like the wine
Look!
She's come
I couldn't recall their names
Have you eaten food?
Please, say that again
Esperanto is 125 years old
Why are you stopping?
The light's green
I'm going to the market
I'm human, too
I don't want to hug you
Is this woman a promoter?
That's real madness
He doesn't agree, does he?
Today, it's gray outside
Don't you even give me a kiss?
I'm going to teach in Wales
Tom did that and I did, too
Thank you, Tatoeba!
Come with us!
Why did you get here so early?
I'll wait until Tom gets here
Where are our cousins?
Australia.
It'll get cold
It's going to become cold
It's going to turn cold
Finally, they gave in
We'll have breakfast at eight
He's fallen into the water
How long will you be staying?
I'll be staying for a month.
How long are you staying?
I'm staying for a month.
No, Mr Miller isn't here
No, Mr Miller's not here
No, Mr Miller isn't here
No, Mr Miller's not here
I've made a mushroom omelette
Who'd like an ice cream?
Who would like an ice cream?
Who wants an ice cream?
Who wants some ice cream?
Does anyone want ice cream?
He didn't have to come himself
Did you take the receipt?
Have you taken the receipt?
It's now six fifteen
Come on, the drinks are on me
Come on, I'll buy you a pint
Come on, I'll get you a pint
Come on, have a drink on me
I've come to apologise
They're not local
It's for you, Tom
I won't ask any more questions
I'm playing a video game
He's forgiven his enemy
How far do you want to go?
I can't agree to this plan
Do you still believe him?
How is your grandfather doing?
Hello, sunshine
Do you have a beef with me?
I'm studying economics
Suffering isn't a virtue
I'll buy a horse
I told Tom I'd seen Mary
I'm beginning to miss Boston
I told Tom that I'd seen Mary
I'm afraid you'll have to go
I don't have much faith in Tom
Is Tom blind?
I've done a good job
Tom's aunt lives in Australia
I'm waiting for you in Berlin
Don't ask me about anything
I'm busy looking for a room
The snow hasn't melted yet
The snow hasn't thawed yet
It's just past six
Has anything gone missing?
I'm learning how to swim
What size does he wear?
What's your weak spot?
Some fast, some slow
Has Jim come yet?
You've just taken a shower
What?
It's impossible
Enter one by one, please
Enter one at a time, please
Where did you buy this milk?
When did the accident occur?
Who bought a book in the shop?
Well, will that happen soon?
Is that a son or daughter?
I asked Tom to re-park his car
Today's youth are bolder
Do you speak Russian?
Yeah, a bit.
I'm waiting for your message
I'm waiting for your text
Good afternoon, Tom!
Good afternoon, Mary!
Why is it so noisy here?
What is this game called?
I've got some snacks
I'm one of the leaders
I can't get to the door
That's not what was agreed
You're shattered
You're knackered
You're whacked out
You're worn out
She's the best pupil
She's the best student
That's the last hole
No one's making a sound
The season's over for him
He says it wasn't a goal
He can't play on
He can't continue playing
He's been sent off
He's shown him the red card
He won't be fit in time
He'll miss the whole season
Have you brought your flask?
Did you bring your flask?
Could you get this translated?
I'm not a greedy person
I'm renovating my house
I've renovated my house
Bad faith is so despicable!
I couldn't find my phone
I don't have enough food
I immediately dialed 911
He's an armchair warrior
Say nothing to anyone!
Does she understand Finnish?
Which school will you go to?
I've changed departments
Let's keep it safe!
I hurried over to Tom's house
If he comes, let me know
What did your dog eat?
Did you guys watch this movie?
I finally got Tom's attention
Why did he write this book?
I'm a bit of an insomniac
I've never been a gambler
I'm talking about myself
I wasn't talking about myself
I've never slept in class
I couldn't prove my theory
I've decided to tell on Tom
I'm going to Rome, Italy
I'm from northern Australia
I don't visit Tom anymore
I'm on my way back home now
Let's go inside the shelter
I've known Jeff for 15 years
He's a lot of fun to be with
I grabbed Tom's wrist
It doesn't like strangers
We here don't like outsiders
I've lowered my expectations
I didn't recognize that woman
I'd prefer to just sit here
I don't mind coming early
I'll go pick Tom up
I'm in bed with a fever
What's this game called?
It didn't rain yesterday
Luckily, I found my keys
Let's play hide-and-seek
The machine isn't working
Goodbye, Tatoeba
He's tired of work
Today's definitely not my day
My life doesn't belong to me
There's no one at work but me
He's fed up
That's how I learned English
I think I'll watch TV
Who has helped them?
Who did they help?
Shut up!
Go eat shit!
Shut up!
Stop!
Do I make my point clear?
Do you understand what I said?
Has Tom come yet?
Tom is a mama's boy
I know I'll see you again
I don't like red
It's soft like wool
I'll ask Tom to come over
Free Turtle Island!
I'd like to take a taxi
Our cat is very high-strung
I'd avoid Tom if I were you
I should've bought it
I wish we'd invited Tom, too
Did you advise Tom to do that?
I won't buy anything from Tom
They don't live together
They're not living together
What does she mean by that?
Are we laying the table?
Are we going to lay the table?
Shall we lay the table?
How many forks do we need?
Tom'll be next door
Is the ice cream nice?
What's this place called?
What's this square called?
Are you a tenant or homeowner?
Watch out!
Mind!
Has anyone asked you anything?
Did anyone ask you anything?
How can you bear this heat?
Isn't there any bread left?
Is there no bread left?
Are those the ones you wanted?
Why are you so grumpy?
Just am.
Are they all like that?
I can see mine, but not yours.
What are you on about again?
I've asked Tom to mow our lawn
Are you proud?
What a smart kid!
Tom's drinking something
I'm not doing as much as I was
You understand?
Will you take them?
Wait—I must warn you
If so, there will be danger
Who's helped them?
I swear I didn't copy that
I'm considering leaving her
Now then—your turn
I've been job hunting!
There aren't any jobs!
There aren't any jobs!
What good am I?
What do I know about business?
It's too hot to do anything
Shall we really try it?
Let's drink to success
I myself didn't do that
How long do spiders live?
And what is Plan B?
There's no way to do that
Why did you buy this horse?
Did you bring a book to read?
I don't remember the incident
I don't work overtime anymore
You're such a fool!
It's distinctive
I'm wishing you all the best
Who helped you do that?
Who is supposed to help me?
I've rewritten the sentence
I've rewritten the report
Is he coming with me?
Have you sent the book?
Have you sent the book yet?
Don't despise yourself
Unfortunately, it was raining
I won't check your work
Does that mean yes or no?
You followed me here?
Did you follow me here?
You don't have to stop
Are you sick?
She's alone
Did you send the book?
The workers don't have helmets
I'm into hiking
That's definitely a mistake
Tom said he'll do it tomorrow
I'll try to keep you informed
I'm not cute!
I'm a very introverted person
I'm leaving that for tomorrow
Yo!
Hurry up!
Come on!
It's still too early to leave
I don't even have a car
They don't want to change
Many people didn't like Tom
Let's stop her!
There's a skunk
We don't study latin
It's a very popular game
What's your cell phone number?
Tom didn't like his teachers
Isn't my best friend Lebanese?
A lot think they're rising
He's taking care of if
Is the priest right?
Do they have Mexican passport?
My best friend was Pakistani?
Tom didn't have nightmares
I'm still laughing out loud!
Love, what is that?
We're going to work in Belgium
Can't they fight back?
Don't you like the coffee?
He doesn't like kissing
A piece of shit like you?
Tom didn't say he would do so
I've done the work
Yes, it's been sent
Don't eat it!
What is this going to lead to?
It's frozen solid
I've never been to America
Don't you like coffee?
I'd like to speak to a lawyer
I've just finished the report
They won't overtake me
How come you don't know?
He's blackmailing her
What's he doing to her?
What's 'thank you' in Berber?
What's that?
It's a gun.
Give it here!
Call an ambulance!
I'll never marry.
I'll never marry either.
If you kill, I'll find you
I don't think I will either.
No, you may not see that
I am too young to die!
Were my questions difficult?
Is he a bottom-feeder?
Is he an opportunist?
You don't have to follow Tom
You don't need to follow Tom
Here we go changing again!
Thanks for your help guys!
It's a nice view on the river
You're so very adorable
Thanks to everyone who's here!
I'm just always busy
How many jobs can teachers do?
What a joker!
What a buffoon!
Nice to see you!
Have you used my camera?
Look, there's my friend
I'll bring a bottle of wine
Stop clowning around!
Who were the Visigoths?
It's an old Visigoth text
How could you be so mean!
Get well soon, kid!
That's civil war
Is the spirit of it wrong?
Where have I seen you before?
Let's just leave him alone!
It's cold over there!
These are our dining halls!
These are our cafeterias!

Tom stole Mary's heart
Why was she so upset?
Why was he so upset?
I'm a languages teacher
You're an awesome teacher
Why was she so nervous?
Why was he so nervous?
There's a party later tonight
Why is Tom so nervous?
Don't make it easy for him
Don't make it easy for her
Don't make it easy for Tom
Don't let it out
Don't let him out
I don't know who took my phone
Did you seriously mean that?
I won't be home tonight
I'll deal with her in person
Who called him?
Do you love life?
Then don't waste time!
Dost thou love life?
Hate me!
Kiss me.
Go take a shower.

Isn't this Thomas's?
We're next
We're well
Were you and Tom close?
Do you want to do me a favor?
What's hell?
I'll take that.
I stayed up until 2:30 a.m
Where do your parents live?
My parents are already dead.

That didn't help me
That won't help him
That won't help her
That won't help them
That won't help us
Yes, I am hale and hearty!

Now I have you!
What a game!
What is air?
Who said no?
Who's ready?

How did he answer?
How did he reply?
Welcome to London!
Have you had a nice day today?
Did you have a nice day today?
Have you set the alarm clock?

She's not Carmen, she's Anna
That's too complicated!
I couldn't think very clearly
I think that's obvious
Did Tom come here today?
Tom said he'd come back
I don't talk to Tom
I think I'm ready to do that
That's an unpleasant affair
Do you still understand?
He didn't want to help
Interesting!
Terrible!
What an atmosphere!
I don't guide them
Some people didn't like it
Tom's vehicle is dirty
Intelligent?
I'm a dumb!
Is this a hippo?
Isn't Tom coming?
I didn't see what was going on
Were you close?
Most cats don't like water
It's not your turn
So what do you think of that?
Does Tom believe us?
It's a complete mess
Let's go today
We've already paid
You'd better go and thank Tom

Was Tom here yesterday?
Don't take this
I didn't like it there
Tom doesn't go there
Is Tom really there?
You have money, don't you?
Well, I don't think so
When did Tom do this?
We aren't sure
Don't close the windows
I'm still taller than Tom
Come here now, Tom
When did Tom fall?
Is Tom really coming?
What makes a person satisfied?
Tom doesn't have to come back
Yes, that's it

I think I'm pretty crazy
When did Tom give up?
I can't think of who that was
What can I teach Tom?
Who stays here?
Does Tom smoke a lot?
I can't stay very long
We're relieved
What a crowd; what a turnout
Let's run away
Let's elope together

Tom ate a fun-sized Mars bar
I didn't promise them anything
Tom said he'd be here tomorrow
You're done for

You claim you weren't there
That's one way to say it
I wasn't here at that time

That's what some people say
I'll try to remember
Can you explain it?

That's a no-no

He's just back from the office
What's that song on the radio?
Where's Mary?
She's on the loo
She'll be back in a minute.
Hello!
Can you hear me?
The connection's bad
Hello!
Can you hear me?
It's a bad line
Hello!
Can you hear me?
The line's bad
Tom's got to take it easy

Did you think that was easy?
I'm going to work in Australia
Is that from Australia?
We knew today's his birthday
Tom lived in Australia in 2013
I'll go to Australia next week
We've never visited Australia
I've bought a lot of books
I've become forgetful
I've finished cleaning my room
Do you know when to do it?
They don't stop calling me
I wonder what's become of Tom
What do you have to read?
We forgot you don't like pizza
I forgot he's your boyfriend
I forgot you're Tom's friend
I forgot you were Tom's wife
It's so windy!
Why are you crying, my love?
Tom can't swim
I don't understand you either
What are you mumbling?
Are your parents teachers?
I'm not sure what Tom meant
Did the singer stop singing?
What is a basher?
This box isn't very heavy
It's your money
It's my money
Close, Sesame!
Christmas?
I don't sell their sheep
Who are you asking about?
I'm not a coward like you
Did you get some rest?
I haven't seen her for a year
Did I arrive on time?
It's all an act
I hope I'll see him tomorrow
Do you have any gum?
I don't do it for the money
I've never heard Tom lie
It's obvious Tom was lying
It won't take long to do that
We'll be landing in 15 minutes
Tom can't walk without a cane
You've got to make a living
You've got to eat
Are you coming with us?
Yes, of course!
My flat isn't far from here
Breathe, motherfucker!
She's from Lisbon
I've seen a live whale
I've seen a live whale once
You've done a very good job
Don't blame yourselves
Is there joy in my heart?
What's for pudding?
He'll give it to you
Who else is on the list?
My best friend isn't Thai
Do you have a Christmas tree?
I'm a she, actually
Don't let the children fight
Respect us, at least
Haven't you told him yet?
Haven't you told her yet?
Turn the page, please
I'm in Berlin
I have to go to the bathroom.
Just look at what you've done
Don't worry
I know exactly what I'm doing
We thought they didn't like it
We thought you didn't like it
They thought we didn't like it
Why is a horse following me?
I don't sing particularly well
Why did he remain in Germany?
Don't work yourself to death
You'll never be happy
I'll never be happy
You know what else, Tom?
I'm glad this worked out
Tom rejected Mary's advances
She's a real nutcase
You've just proved my point
May I have some rice?
Are you married or single?
Oh, I don't know
Is it strange?
Can you limit the noise?
Who created Tatoeba?
I'm talking to a friend
I'll get back to you shortly
What caused you to come here?
Bingo!
Do you remember everything?
Do you have something else?
Isn't that cool?
Got a problem with that?
Where's Tom already?
Okay, I'll do what you say
What is your objective?
You're the only one I have
Confess!
Can I come to get you at 5:30?
Don't stand in front of me!
Are you hungry or thirsty?
Today is the first day of 2019
Islam is perfect, but I am not
Are you sleepy or tired?
He's got in with a bad crowd
Don't repeat yourself!
Is she right?
Is she correct?
She's a computer expert
I think you'll find him
I think you'll find her
Sweet sassy molassy!
Do you speak Umbundu?
That's the end of it
I'm not through with you yet
They're trying out a new car
My boss thinks he's God
When does breakfast start?
Do you like to eat fruit?
How well do you know your son?
You're so stupid sometimes
Don't forget the milk
Is hydrotherapy effective?
I don't use their garden
I don't harvest their garden
You teach, we listen
Wash!
Give!
Are you allowed?
Long day?
Lean!
I'm speechless!
Car!
Cheese!
Ah, sit!
Going to eat!
Not today!
Great, thanks
Say "ahhh!
They wouldn't lie
Does she know me?
You're very humble
They're my friends from work
Is the watch on the table?
Didn't he come?
Something isn't kosher here
Don't make that face
You can't do this to me!
I don't have a clue who he is
I don't have a clue who she is
So where's the problem?
Today, two students are absent
Do you have relatives here?
Are you a moron?
Are you meshuga?
It's easy to eat too much
Tom walks 10,000 steps per day
I don't eat that much
Reindeer pull Santa's sleigh
Tom follows a low-carb diet
Why do dogs chase squirrels?
Tom's dog seems happy
Tom's dog loves people
Tom went dog-sledding
Can you waive the fee for me?
It's snowed a lot
Don't be afraid
That disease isn't contagious
Will we get gasoline?
What'll you leave behind?
Why are you doing this now?
Has anyone been helping you?
Does everyone need to do this?
Did anyone else do that?
Do you know what to say?
Aren't you're Mary?
I'm not Mary, I'm Marie!
Do you eat pasta?
Here's some money
Why does Tom look so sad?
We're not lovebirds
Shut up!
Not in front of him!
You're not sleepy
So you're his brother!
Is she going to remember me?
It's beginning to get late
It's already getting late
No, they're not fascists
Of course they're fascists
They shall not pass!
She's a pretty woman
What's your sister doing now?
How wide is this road?
Where's the telephone book?
If it rains, I won't go
What's become of Tom?
When will Tom return home?
Does Tom work in this city?
Did Tom have a hard time?
Has Tom finished the book yet?
Has Tom finished his work yet?
It seems we've lost our way
Could you lend me some money?
Do you think Tom is sensible?
Did Tom propose any solutions?
Has Tom stayed here before?
Why did Tom fail in business?
Which direction did Tom go?
Did Tom mention the accident?
He's fashionable
I've never been there myself
I've seen a shooting star once
I've seen Mt
I've climbed Mt
Where was Tom born and raised?
Who'll be elected chairman?
What's the departure time?
Where's the changing room?
Where's the nearest station?
What's going on there now?
Do you know Tom at all?
Do you hear from Tom often?
When did you buy that watch?
What's written in the book?
What was Tom up to then?
What do you study French for?
Why did Tom change his plans?
Why did Tom come with Mary?
What made Tom change his mind?
What's cooking in the kitchen?
I noticed Tom's hands shaking
I've made Tom angry
That's surely nonsense
Tell me why he's crying
This is Thilelli's calculator
This is Yidir's calculator
Tom tsk-tsked
It's an antique
Do you think Tom was hungry?
I haven't seen Tom yet today
Don't wear yourselves out
It's an antique clock
I'm getting out now
I'm going out now
Tom's wound got infected
I've lost my new fountain pen
I've already packed my things
I didn't want Tom to kiss me
How do we stop guys like Tom?
Don't tire yourselves out
Don't force us to do that
I didn't notice Tom's arrival
Don't force me to do that
Did you find that amusing?
Breakfast isn't ready yet
Did what Tom say make sense?
Tom's shift ends at midnight
Why are you laughing at Tom?
You're very good at that
You're doing pretty well
I've been busy since yesterday
I haven't felt well recently
I've seen Tom quite recently
I haven't had a cold recently
Am I the most humble?
They're wasting time
Why did Tom bring you here?
I didn't want Tom to hate me
The message wasn't from Tom
Why is your name circled?
Why did my wife leave me?
Tom's boss is yelling at him
Now, you try
What's your objective?
Is this French or English?
Why are you working late?
Why are you still crying?
Why are you so exhausted?
When did Tom get this coat?
Why are you hoarse today?
I didn't want Tom to give up
What did your lawyer say?
OK, I'll do what you say
Bravo, Tom!
I've decided to buy a vehicle
Tom is well-paid
What did you dream about?
We're on the third floor
The house over there is Tom's
I forgot you didn't like pizza
There's a woman in the room
There's no such thing as ESP
We're all united in friendship
Otherwise I would've missed it
Germany.
German.
What beautiful words!
I'm a native of Kiev
I'm a native of Moscow
I'll have to see what Tom says
I love you, baby.
I love you too.
We want what's best for you
When did Tom get that coat?
You can't talk to Tom today
These pants don't fit me
Was I supposed to lie to you?
I'm sorry
I love you, baby.
I love you, too.
That won't likely happen
Let's do that at Tom's house
I wish I could come, too
I don't dare
I've got an upset stomach
My family isn't very big
When did Tom buy that coat?
It wasn't fun doing that
Living with Tom wasn't easy
Are you the same age as Tom?
I'm trying to enjoy life
Idir sang in Algeria in 2018
Do you like coconut water?
Don't feel well!
It's the worst!
I don't want to!
I'm trying to be patient
I'm waiting for Tom's answer
I'm the richest one here
I'm not used to the heat
Is Tom still able to drive?
I wasn't allowed to sing
Let's ask Tom to explain it
I forgot Tom's sister's name
I've traveled many times
He was poor, but he was honest
What was that you said?
How do you know me?
You're out of danger now
Does Tom still remember me?
In my opinion, Tom is wrong
Why didn't you talk to Tom?
I can't say anything now
I can't go out like this
Do you know if this is Tom's?
How is your name spelled?
French isn't spoken here
Does Tom have any siblings?
French isn't easy for us
In my opinion, Tom is right
Do you guys drink coffee?
Why are you upset with Tom?
Did you enjoy yourselves?
Did you do it yourselves?
Do you know Tom's dog's name?
Aren't you and I friends?
Did you know Tom back then?
Are you kidding us?
You can't dodge bullets
We're sure of Tom's success
Why aren't you prepared?
Why are you talking now?
I've climbed Mt
The blue umbrella is Tom's
I wish I'd bought an umbrella
I think I've lost my umbrella
I think this is Tom's umbrella
Why are you hounding me?
Did Tom eat the whole cake?
Why are you here anyway?
Who's playing the piano?
We've run out of coffee
We're on the right path
I won't follow Tom's advice
Tom wasn't invited to the ball
Tom doesn't do that any longer
I'll never forget Tom's answer
I hope I'll see Tom tomorrow
I forgot Tom didn't eat meat
I hope Tom doesn't find out
Tom regrets he couldn't go
Tom is sure he'll succeed
That's not the point, Tom
That isn't the point, Tom
Tom says that he'll come
I don't work with Tom
I talked to Tom, too
Tom is Mary's dad
I saw Tom, too
Tom's handwriting is terrible
Tom wants to be Mary's friend
Tom tried to steal Mary's car
Tom is sitting at Mary's desk
Tom is in his room, unpacking
Tom got out of prison in 2013
Tom and I don't work together
Tom was still single in 2013
Tom is this building's owner
Tom is still at Mary's house
Tom is John's other roommate
Tom is John's former partner
Tom didn't cheat on the test
Tom stole Mary's sunglasses
Tom isn't very easy to like
Tom isn't used to the noise
Tom is really, really happy
Tom is reading Mary's diary
Tom's spelling is terrible
Tom yelled out Mary's name
Tom isn't ready for school
Why didn't you do that?
I forgot.
Tom is wasting Mary's time
Tom is really, really nice
Tom is really, really busy
Tom is my sister's husband
Tom is a multi-millionaire
Tom is John's new roommate
Tom has a minimum-wage job
Tom didn't seem very alert
Tom didn't read the manual
Tom didn't accomplish much
Tom was here, but he left
Tom is really, really shy
Tom is really, really old
Tom's date was with Mary
We've decided to travel by car
We're sick of your complaining
We must hurry or we'll be late
We didn't accomplish very much
Tom is working full-time
Mr. Jackson is our gym teacher
Mary couldn't find her husband
Let's have a party next Monday
Let's go to Boston this summer
I'm waiting for the school bus
I'm trying to be a good person
I'm looking for a butcher shop
I'm going to the grocery store
We're searching for the truth
Mr. Jackson is my gym teacher
Let's sit closer to the front
I've got to go home and study
I'm very skeptical about that
Tom doesn't work with me
I'm the happiest man on Earth
I'm really confused right now
I'm in dire need of your help
I'm going to the liquor store
I can't help you until Monday
Can you give me a better deal?
Tom stole Mary's gloves
Why is that dog following us?
Whose idea was it to do that?
We're nearly out of kerosene
We don't know where to start
Let's take a break for lunch
Let's list the pros and cons
Let's go for a walk together
Let's forget the whole thing
Let's all chip in some money
I'm hopeful about the future
I'm going to a party tonight
I'll walk you to the station
I'd like to start over again
Does this look purple to you?
You'll just have to wing it
Why are you in the basement?
Where did you buy this coat?
What is the capital of Iowa?
We're thinking about moving
We're on a first name basis
We're in really big trouble
Tom hung up Mary's coat
Tom doesn't sleep a lot
We met at 2:30, as arranged
We haven't had any luck yet
We can't leave until Monday
Tom stole Mary's candy
Let's ditch school tomorrow
I'm trying to get some rest
Are you going to tell on me?
We've both seen this movie
Tom is still at Mary's
We're waiting for our food
We're not hiring right now
We'll be there before long
We can't delay much longer
May I see the menu, please?
Let's sing a duet together
Let's rest under that tree
Let's eat out on the patio
I'm trying to get to sleep
I'm never going back there
I was still single in 2013
I didn't exactly mean that
I can't find my sunglasses
Do I have to I answer that?
Can't you tell me anything?
Can we change the key to G?
We're operating at a loss
We're having stew tonight
We'll do that at any cost
We'll be there in no time
We'll be home before long
We didn't accomplish much
We aren't going to Boston
Tom still hasn't left
That's not an orange tree
Sorry, I didn't mean that
My alarm went off at 6:30
Let's play hooky tomorrow
Tom is very laid-back
I'm thinking about moving
I'm not very good at golf
I don't like Italian food
How big a jar do you need?
How big a box do you need?
Why are you in the attic?
Who turned on the lights?
We're leaving about noon
We'll be home in no time
We can't go until Monday
Tom is Mary's trainer
Please don't let me down
My friend isn't Canadian
Let's not get hysterical
Tom didn't write that
Let's go for a bike ride
Let's drive to the beach
I'm making a good living
I'm going to try my best
I'll be home before long
Do you like jumping rope?
Yes, that's what I mean
We're sailing southward
We'll leave at daybreak
Is your friend Canadian?
I'm thinking about that
I'll pay for the drinks
I don't like being sick
I couldn't stop yawning
Do you have many guests?
Why did you write this?
We're so glad you came
May I use your bicycle?
Let's talk over coffee
Let's meet at the mall
Let's get back to camp
Is this your jump rope?
I'm still very worried
I'm kind of hungry now
I'm buying a new piano
I don't type very fast
I don't know precisely
You must've forgotten
Why did you want that?
Who is this other guy?
Tom is mild-mannered
We'll never surrender
We can't afford a car
Let's drive to Boston
I'm kind of tired now
Are your parents here?
Why did you write it?
Who stole your money?
What's the score now?
We've done our share
We're open till 6:30
We're not beaten yet
That's an apple tree
Let's return to camp
It's my turn to cook
I'm very, very tired
I'm still interested
Tom isn't qualified
I'm kind of busy now
Could I get a refill?
Are you a risk taker?
What an opportunity!
We've been defeated
We'll leave at dawn
My dog doesn't bite
It's past my curfew
It's my turn to bat
I'm green with envy
I'm aching all over
Don't be such a pig
Don't be so pompous
Don't be so naughty
Do we have a quorum?
Which way is south?
Which way is north?
To tell the truth, I hate Tom
I'm sick of Tom's complaining
May I use your pen?
I was shocked by Tom's answer
Let's go for a run
I'm here by myself
I'll walk you home
Why did Tom's wife leave him?
I won't oppose you
Tom didn't buy eggs
Who cares when Tom does that?
We shouldn't let Tom do that
How about a refill?
Did you get my fax?
Which way is west?
Which way is east?
What a crazy idea!
Ask Tom if he'll come or not
What else we can do for Tom?
I'd like to marry Tom again
Let's sing a duet
It's Tom's fault, not mine
It's worth a look
It's a crazy idea
I want to believe you, Tom
Is there a quorum?
I'm lousy at golf
How did Tom's interview go?
I'm a slow typist
I'll lead the way
Why does Tom look so pale?
I'll be over soon
I'd like a refill?
Mary is Tom's real mother
I've been honest with Tom
You are imaginative, Tom
Don't tip it over
Don't call me sir
Why should Tom want that?
Whose duty is it?
We close at 6:30
We can't do without Tom
It's just a joke
I'll fill you in
We're lodging with Tom
I'd like a steak
I'm sure Tom will come
Can't you fix it?
Let's leave Tom alone
Is Tom feeling better?
I'll do my part
Don't be foolish, Tom
Why should Tom do it?
Was Tom kind to Mary?
I can't keep up
Cookie is Tom's dog
I'm filling in
Close the door, Tom
Did you touch Tom?
Did Tom know this?
Who did do it?
Where's home?
What's money?
Hey, wake up
Thank you, Tom
Hey, get up
He's Tom
Tom doesn't mind the work
Tom doesn't like his name
Tom doesn't eat very much
Tom didn't like the party
Tom didn't like the movie
Tom couldn't find his hat
Tom can't stay for dinner
Tom can't hear us, I hope
Tom can't find his gloves
Tom can't drive very well
Tom can't control his dog
Tom can wait, but I can't
You're doing pretty well
Tom won't do that for me
Could you please speak louder?
I can't hear you
Tom isn't that religious
Tom isn't an electrician
Tom isn't a good plumber
Tom isn't a good manager
Tom is my brother-in-law
Tom is at home, sleeping
Tom got arrested in 2013
Tom doesn't want trouble
Tom doesn't live near me
Tom won't want to dance
Tom wasn't married then
Tom was frightened, too
Tom told me to call 911
Tom likes you, you know
Tom didn't jump into the water
Tom isn't a good skater
Tom isn't a good farmer
Tom isn't a fussy eater
Tom is outside, smoking
Tom is a double-amputee
Tom didn't visit Boston
Tom can't see very well
Tom can't drink tequila
Don't blame yourselves
It's our fault
Tom won't get promoted
Tom was caught in 2013
I'm sorry, Tom
I just can't do this
I can't drive now
I've been drinking
Tom isn't yet an adult
Tom isn't the director
Tom isn't a good skier
Tom isn't a bad singer
I'm not drunk
I'm just really tired
Tom is frightened, too
Tom is downstairs, too
Would you like to go?
Tom doesn't dislike it
Tom didn't eat dessert
Tom stole some of Mary's money
Do you believe Tom?
Not really.
I didn't want Tom to help Mary
Tom won't give Mary any money
Tom shouldn't call Mary again
Tom is a drummer, too
I can't drive
I've been drinking
Tom doesn't like Mary anymore
Tom didn't give Mary anything
Tom asked Mary why she'd lied
Whose umbrella is this?
Whose bicycle is this?
Tom got up early, too
Mary doesn't like waitressing
Tom won't go to Mary's party
Tom filmed Mary's concert
Tom isn't in bed yet
Tom asked for Mary's address
Tom is sleeping, too
Tom is doing sit-ups
Mary didn't kill her husband
Why is Tom pointing at Mary?
What'll Tom do without Mary?
You won't find doing that easy
You shouldn't blame yourselves
You can't really change people
You can't change your username
Tom didn't turn back
We won't have time to do today
We won't be allowed to do that
Tom is brushing Mary's hair
There's nothing more I can say
Pregnant women shouldn't smoke
I'm sorry, Tom
I can't do this
I've said this a million times
I've never spent a day in jail
I've heard about what happened
I've gotten used to doing this
I've been sick for a long time
I've become accustomed to that
I've always liked the outdoors
I'm waiting for my opportunity
I'm proud of what they've done
I'm pretty miserable right now
I'm pretty intrigued right now
I'm pretty desperate right now
I'm pretty depressed right now
I'm not going to shut the door
I'm not exactly an outdoorsman
I'm just telling you the facts
I'm interested in volunteering
I'm here and I'm ready to help
I'm going to make you eat that
I'm already used to doing that
I'm afraid to go into the cave
I'll take that exam in October
I'll meet you in the lunchroom
I'll know if you don't do that
I'll get the chance to do that
I wouldn't want that to happen
I won't eat breakfast tomorrow
I wasn't aware of that problem
I wasn't allowed in that store
I really wasn't in any trouble
I probably should've just left
I haven't finished my homework
I haven't accepted the job yet
I don't like that kind of cake
I didn't intend to deceive you
I couldn't help the way I felt
I can't remember what happened
I can't quite make sense of it
I can't go back home right now
I can't do that with you today
I can't afford to go to Boston
I can't afford a car right now
Tom won't forget it
Don't underestimate yourselves
Don't make fools of yourselves
Don't go outside
It's raining
Don't go into the jungle alone
Don't compare yourselves to us
Tom wasn't drinking
Don't be so hard on yourselves
You're too hard on yourselves
Why did you buy those glasses?
Why did you buy that umbrella?
Why are you trying to do this?
Why are you afraid to do that?
Where did you learn that from?
Where are you going next week?
When did you lose your gloves?
What motivated you to do that?
What fruits are in season now?
What did you do to yourselves?
What convinced you to do that?
We've got a marketing problem
We won't have time to do that
We won't allow that to happen
We didn't get a chance to try
We can't hide here any longer
Was I not supposed to do that?
Swear you won't do that again
It'll be necessary to do that
I've started doing that again
I've never actually used this
I've learned from my mistakes
I've helped other people, too
I've gotten used to the smell
I've gotten used to the noise
I've got to leave before 2:30
I've been sick for three days
I've been on TV several times
I've been called a pig before
I'm pretty homesick right now
I'm pretty helpless right now
I'm pretty confused right now
I'm not yet used to the smell
I'm not used to being ignored
I'm not that hungry right now
I'm not talking about just me
I'm not interested in science
I'm having a very a good time
I'm happy with what I'm doing
I'm going to keep working out
I'm going to keep this letter
I'm going to keep on fighting
I'm glad everything went well
Hurry!
I'm drinking a glass of rosé
I'm dreading this whole thing
I'm always learning something
I'll have a chance to do that
I'll be there on October 20th
I'd prefer a simpler approach
I'd need to see more evidence
I'd like to be there with you
I wouldn't want to live there
I won't tell you who did that
I won't have time to do today
Perhaps Tom didn't see Mary
I won't be able do that today
I understand what's happening
I haven't tried that in years
I haven't got any energy left
I haven't gone to college yet
I haven't done anything today
Mary is a mother, isn't she?
I don't worry about it at all
I don't want to miss anything
I don't want to do this again
I don't usually drink tequila
I don't think it'll affect me
I don't like driving at night
Suddenly, Tom and I were alone
I didn't see any other option
I didn't expect to be so busy
I didn't expect anything else
I decided I'd take that risk
I couldn't read anything more
I can't tolerate this anymore
I can't stay with you forever
I can't leave the house today
Whose umbrella is this?
It's Tom's.
I can't be everywhere at once
Does Tom know what Mary did?
How often do you go to church?
How much do taxi drivers make?
How much do firefighters make?
How do you support yourselves?
French isn't my mother tongue
Where did Tom go with Mary?
Doing that won't be an option
Does it rain a lot in October?
Do you know that woman's name?
Can you figure out the answer?
Tom wouldn't have hit Mary
Are both of you students here?
You're worrying way too much
Tom won't let Mary do this
Why did you bring this to me?
Why are you still doing that?
Why are you so grouchy today?
Why are you so good at chess?
Why are you doing that today?
Why are you acting so stupid?
Who do you usually work with?
Who did you buy that hat for?
Where is your school located?
Let's wait until Tom gets here
Where does your brother live?
When did you see that happen?
What time will the party end?
What else do you want to see?
We're still going to do that
We'll laugh about this later
Let's wait until Tom gets back
Tom is fishing, too
My name's Tom
What's your name?
That'll be easy for me to do
Just don't tell Tom about this
Please don't cross this line
Whose bicycle is this?
It's Tom's.
Now's your chance to do that
Most of us shouldn't do that
Let's do this again tomorrow?
I'll ask Tom to do that for us
I've noticed a change lately
I've never committed a crime
I've gotten used to the heat
I've done a lot of traveling
I've decided to study abroad
I've been here since October
I've always loved this place
I've already called the cops
I've already called for help
I'm writing a book in French
I'm very positive about this
I'm talking now about Boston
I'm reading a book in French
I'm pretty worried right now
I'm pretty puzzled right now
I'm pretty pleased right now
I'm pretty nervous right now
I'm pretty jittery right now
I'm pretty freaked right now
I'm pretty annoyed right now
I'm not used to working late
I'm not used to these things
I'm not used to living alone
I'm not used to eating alone
I'm just trying to stay warm
I'm going to keep doing that
I'm a student, not a teacher
I'll try to get home by 2:30
I'll help you find that book
I'll get a chance to do that
I'll clean your room for you
Tom is at Mary's apartment
I'd rather be playing tennis
I won't have time to do that
I just don't like doing that
I haven't been off the train
You're too young to live alone
You're partially responsible
You're a creative individual
You said that you'd help me
We're happy this happened
We're happy that this happened
We're glad this happened
We're glad that this happened
We don't open until ten
We don't open until 10:00
Nobody believes you're guilty
No one believes you're guilty
Let's take a cab
I'm sorry I came
I'm sorry that I came
I'm not threatening you
I'm happy you did that for me
I'll speak with the teacher
I'll cook you something
I think we're still too young
Don't stand in front of me

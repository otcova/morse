Do you love music?
Bite down tightly, please
Taking a little time off?
Smoking or non-smoking?
Take your time, Yoshida
Let's carry on the discussion
Whose is the book on the desk?
Let's sing some merry songs
Get out, or you will be sorry
For how many nights?
How many people?
Don't cry before you're hurt
Have you got a pencil?
If only the rain would stop!
In time, Tom came to love her
It's almost 11
Enough TV, already!
A double, please
Is Mr Schmidt at home now?
Sam, don't!
My stars!
Where's this train bound for?
Three coffees, please
Serve the coffee, please
Kennedy Airport, please
You haven't eaten the cake yet
Mr Crouch, what do you do?
Don't answer your mother back
That is not an orange, either
Where has that memo got to?
Do you go by train or by car?
Pity you can't come
All of you, shut up!" he said
Let's drink to absent friends
Care for tea or coffee?
It's up to you
Did you mark the papers?
Shall I bring a magazine?
Where's the bus for the city?
Will you let me at it?
Did you do well in the exam?
It's baking hot
It's made of fine cotton
For shame!
He did his best, but in vain
They didn't know it themselves
She's still chatting away
It will be fine tomorrow, too
That's what I want to say
Sasha and Malia!
Where is the telephone book?
Good question!
He hasn't got a bicycle
We didn't intend to attack him
One roll of color film, please
Wherever you go, I will follow
It'll soon be six o'clock
I don't mind if I do!
You're a right little rascal!
You can't park on the pavement
He's always losing his mobile
Please don't smoke too much
She's passed an English exam
Have you got that in stock?
Has the house got a garden?
Has the flat got a garden?
Has the flat got a garage?
We're having a barbie
Shit!
Oh, sure
Which film did you see?
Where?
Follow me!
Can you help them?
Don't read this sentence
I still don't know that
You didn't need to hurry
Bring your student ID!
Coffee or tea?
My eyes hurt!
Do you want a glass?
Stop studying!
How did you enter my room?
I can change.
I don't want you to change.
Cold coffee is horrible!
I don't know where yours is
This bet won't go well for me
Come and look at this!
We're bordering on failure
Son, men don't have abortions.
Don't breathe!
It's poisonous gas
I've always been number one
Unfortunately, she didn't come
Is there a problem with him?
When was your first love?
Have you got a dog?
They say he's sick
They say she's sick
I've missed travelling so much
I've been to Canada once
Speak Italian!
No, Dad!
That's the reason she's late
We're out of chairs
We'll decide it like men
Bring the dice!
I'm on my holiday
We'd better go to another room
They'd easily hear us here
I am eighty-five years old
That's just how you look
That dog is really old!
How will you go to Osaka?
We're coming home
I think he's a man of ability
That's what matters
It's not where I parked it
I don't work for anybody
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
Helena is a secretary, right?
It's very hot
Come on, do it for me
We're going to make a cake
Someone's coming
Close the box and hide it!
I don't accept the proposal!
And that's it!
I'll go check out the bedroom
Something's wrong with him
Why don't you shut up?
I don't feel good
Did you mean that seriously?
Do you know it?
I hope he will understand me!
Is it a good hotel?
Yes, but it is too far away.
She told me "Open the window
Now I'm the one who's speaking
I haven't told him anything
He'll never betray you
I've scolded him many times
If I were you, I'd ask him
I can't help laughing at him
I'm bored at home!
They don't speak Spanish
For all my life, I was a liar
That's why people liked me
No offense!
But Saule didn't want to go
They don't pay attention to me
I do need a vacation!
It must be beginner's luck
No, please go, both of you
Legalize it!
I'm Icelandic
How did he ever get so lucky?
Hello, honey
They're original
Go ahead, smell them
You're escaping
You're screaming
You're not Brazilian, are you?
Why don't you quit Facebook?
You're a hottie
Now, don't you feel better?
What is your star sign?
Do you like music?
Why are there so many people?
Salt, please
Can you speak Uyghur?
She doesn't speak my language
He isn't married
He's not married
You should write a book!
He's drunk
He's stupid
He isn't running
Emily isn't afraid of spiders
I'll live in the city
Poor thing!
I don't speak English
It's eight o'clock
How do you make coffee?
Do you remember her name?
You can't rely on him
They're reading his book
I'd rather die than surrender!
Let's go play football!
She'll confess sooner or later
She won't be missed
The cat's out of the bag
Do you go in for sports?
The dog is man's best friend
We aren't as good as you
Don't "thou" me
Don't "fellow" me
Don't let anyone in his room
Fortunately, she didn't die
She can't be ill
OK, sorry, see you tomorrow
He's jealous
She's writing
He's wrapped up in his studies
This place is like a madhouse!
I am disconsolate!
What a freak!
This man is a real freak!
Tetanus continues to kill!
Have you changed shampoos?
Thank you, anyway
Why do you give him money?
He's a financial wizard
It's time to wind up
Whom do you work for?
Don't wander from the subject
I'm getting bad vibes from him
What did she do to her hair?
Nothing much!
He doesn't own many books
What are we gonna do?
The meat's gone bad
No!
Start!
You have a minute?
Yes, why?
Death to the king!
I'm gonna tell you the truth
You're stronger than me
I hope we'll see you again
Don't cut young trees
Don't smoke
Don't let it get you down!
Let's get to the point!
Don't overwork, will you?
He's engrossed in his book
I won't have you lying to me!
He's not open to my arguments
Don't blame it on the weather!
Keep at it!
There wasn't a living soul
I'll teach him some manners
He has become more easy-going
Do you have a stopwatch?
Does a cow have a pink udder?
What's your fetish?
That's a provocative pose
You know I don't like it
Do you have wet wipes?
Why do cows ruminate?
He's a gigolo
He's a pediatrician
He's a twat
I'll have to become a cat lady
He didn't break my heart
I'm pining for him
I don't eat poultry
He's her beau now
Drop dead!
I've used up my Q-tips
Can myrtle be used in cooking?
I don't like the taste of okra
Why are you so clingy?
That's an eerie melody
He's a patriarch
That's an unquestionable fact
God's will is unquestionable
Don't dramatize
Everything's fine
I'm a single child
He's a single father
Don't let evil into your heart
He's celebrating his name day
Don't find me
What's your favourite animal?
I don't understand this song
It appears I've dozed off
Would that be nice?
Where is the nearest pharmacy?
I didn't get enough sleep
Did you sleep well today?
Do you plant pumpkins?
I'm no longer groggy
I'll show you a good time
I'm not the trendy type
He and I are like-minded
I'm having an adrenaline rush
It's not the real thing
I've read the book
They say that he's very rich
Did I frighten you?
Did you do it just for kicks?
Pigs are even-toed ungulates
Tapirs are odd-toed ungulates
When do salmon spawn?
Ready!
He's force-feeding his goose
I fixed the computer.
Yeah, right.
I unlocked the safe.
Yeah, right.
We can't be together anymore
It wasn't meant to be
It's right under your nose
I'll retype it
You can't do whatever you like
Why did you break my vase?
Tit for tat.
What are you doing?
I'm vegetating.
Why are you so morose?
Was it written by a foreigner?
Come on, Tom, bust him up!
I'll give you what for
That's a very big bite
I heard Mary's singing
He's eating pork chops
Are pike edible?
Tom's mobile butt-dialled Mary
Tom butt-dialled Mary
Is it okay if I don't show up?
Is that okay?
No, it's not okay.
That's imitation leather
Don't step in the mud
What causes websites to lag?
How can I fix the lag?
Stop slacking or I'll fire you
That's a strenuous task
Tom doesn't love me.
Well, boohoo.
Have you eaten seafood?
Shellfish, let's say
How typical of Tom.
Mary, are you decent?
Tom's dog is a mutt
Mary's neighbor is a busybody
It's too foggy
I can't see a thing
That's dry information
That's a very dry explanation
Are you making a snowman?
No, I'm making a snow woman.
I'm not that stupid, you know.
Oh, please
He's flying on a winged horse
I'll be working all weekend.
Why?
Thank you for the promotion.
Why is your mouth open?
Why not?
What's the product's code?
You've missed a button
That's not something to go by
Why does your brother hate me?
Tom is Mary's make out buddy
You did what?
Actually, yes
We shouldn't be lollygagging
I don't have a Twitter account
I didn't fathom this happening
She's hooked on Farmville
Come dance!
Don't worry about this
They're jealous of my noodles
Tom loves his daughter's face
You're too cynical
Where do you train?
You'll be fine with me
Are you desperate for company?
I'm broke
You'll stay out of it
You hear me?
How far along is she pregnant?
You'll be gorgeous
Human's nature scares me
Let's keep an eye on that
I see he's still asleep
That doesn't happen every day
I'm going to let you go
Did I come at a good time?
There's no crime in that
I'm sure that he'll come
It's anybody's guess
He's a dead cert for the job
He can't compare with you
I just can't fathom it
It's my belief that he's lying
It's beyong belief
He's an awful busybody
I didn't mean to be nosy
I'm very disappointed in him
That's a tall order
I'm in two minds about going
I'm getting all mixed up
Be gone!
Can I sleep at your place?
I'm a business man
I'll go back and sort this
It's really not rocket science
There's no time for talking
Time has come to act!
What if she's gone for good?
I don't like energy drinks
I'm so glad I listened to you
I don’t want to be taken in
I'm not falling for this again
What's the point?
I'm still young
Do you want some?
I'm way over my limit
I'm currently training a dog
I hope she'll like it
I'm watching out for your baby
This kid just isn't possible
It was cowardly, and I'm sorry
I've been pretty distracted
I've been bit by a snake
I've been to a lot of funerals
I've been a terrible host
I've been summoned by a judge
I got grounded for 2 weeks
She's a sweetheart
She just can't wait
She's just a babe in the woods
She's singing in her room
She's a little political
She's smart and quite lovely
She's about to be discharged
She's at her tennis lesson
She's more powerful than you
She's lucky to have him
She's better in smaller groups
She's like a dove of peace
She's vital to the mission
She's just a bit nauseous
She's on holiday with a friend
We've both been under stress
I don't think it is over
I don't think it's incurable
I don't joke around
I don't take life lightly
What are we dealing with here?
I'm gonna take you there
Is the news good or bad?
She's not all that gorgeous
I was born in 1933
I won't give up on us
Tom doesn't know his birthdate
I didn't expect more bloodshed
Mary doesn't seem very warm
I was sick, but I'm fine now
Unfortunately, I have bad news
What do you fancy for dinner?
Let me fasten my seat belt!
Is this project even feasible?
Let's get a bite to eat
Who can field this question?
I'll find a way to get a raise
I've found my man!
It's almost done
She is a real firecracker!
First come, first served!
First stop, the laboratory
Then we'll see
What's its fiscal status?
Are you going fishing?
It fits you like a glove!
He's quite fit!
He's fit for the position
I can't fit you in my schedule
This water isn't fit to drink
Have you fixed the dates yet?
Mary, you're flattering me
I'm truly flattered!
Why don't we flip a coin?
We're going to flip it
Let's have foie gras to start
I'd like you to meet my folks
I'm footing the bill tonight
Whose footprints are these?
Don't touch it for a minute!
First of all, I'm not for sale
I'm in town for one night only
Do you foresee any changes?
You're such a freak
I can't see a freaking thing!
Tom is totally freaking nuts!
Has the freight arrived yet?
Don't fret too much, okay?
It's genius!
Get away from it all!
I'll get even with him!
I'm trying to get fit
Should we get going?
Let's get hitched!
I'm getting kind of hungry
Get off me!
Get me out of this place!
Have you gotten paid yet?
It's not easy, it's but doable
I don't have a lawyer now
Maria is Maria and Tom is Tom.
What are you thinking about?
Nothing special.
Do you think that I'm scary?
I love Sino-Tibetan languages
She's in the forest
A mighty choir was required!
You're right!
Good night, Tom!
Sweet dreams!
Thanks, Maria!
You too!
You're such a wimp
I'm writing nonsense
I'm writing gibberish
I'm a very intuitive person
I'm on your heels
I'm on your tail
I'm not going to Tom's concert
There's still a little left
Let's do it once more
Can raw meat be fed to cats?
Do cats' claws need trimming?
Tomato, tomato
This dress fits like a glove!
You've disappointed me a lot
Sami's a waiter at a gay bar
What time do we meet up there?
Behave yourself, will you?
Show a little courtesy!
The party's in full swing
I'll sit and wait here for Tom
Who is your favorite comedian?
My father can't lift it up
You aren't Brazilian, are you?
Good morning, princess
If you can come, just come
Recently, Thailand is very hot
That isn't what we do
It isn't easy, but it's doable
Why have you come only now?
It’s not out of desperation
I'm convinced I should do that
I always yawn when I'm sleepy
What a language it is!
When shall we go to London?
What did he wish to show you?
Who speaks Esperanto?
Good day, sir
Very well, sir, thank you
Who knocks?
Who is there?
It is I. Open
Are you two still dating?
Tom doesn't age
Tom doesn't age
Let's go up to the house
Hallelujah!
Shouldn't you phone home?
I'm dying for something to eat
I'm lost without my computer
Did you eat my sandwich?
We can't make a decision yet
I don't find this funny
I don't find this funny at all
That is a very sharp knife!
He's a good lawyer
Your phone is ringing.
Our mosque doesn't have stairs
What's your mobile number?
What is your mobile number?
Don't say a thing
Act fast while supplies last!
Why is this boycott necessary?
He wouldn't dare lie to me
Do you like what you do?
It's a mosquito bite
What did you see, Nancy?
We don't know who the lady is
Did I keep you waiting?
Is there enough room for us?
I'm religious
Is my translation OK?
I'm drinking beer
Tom's phone started vibrating
11, 2001 terrorist attacks
“I feel optimistic.”
Tom doesn't have the virus
He was 88
I am not kidding about this.”
We can’t get more ventilators
When will the bad news end?
The barn's roof collapsed
Tom's wife left home for work
Tom's fear came true
Mary's fear came true
And me?
Why do people yawn?
Why do zombies love brains?
Tom's fears came true
Mary's fears came true
Can you get mono from a kiss?
Why are boys so cute?
Why are girls so attractive?
Why are guys so attractive?
Why is the sun so bright?
Why is water wet?
Why is this bread so tasty?
Tom is not very touchy-feely
Mary is touchy-feely
I'm not a jealous person
Tom went to an après-ski bar
How do banks make money?
Oh, look!
They're kissing!
I’m very calm about everything
I’m just taking it day by day
Her husband works there, too
“It’s overwhelming,” she says
I'm lucky to have some savings
I'm worried
He called them "imbeciles.
Don’t get the phone wet
Tom doesn't like pandemics
It's not a bank
We can't do it for them
No, this is not a referral
It's small
I'm glad it's sunny today
Don't leave my side, okay?
Do you know what year it is?
Why don't you walk Mary home?
Have you tried to scream?
Actually, I am working
I didn't come, since it rained
Come back!
Your story isn't over yet
It's a quarter after four
Stop thief, stop thief!
Are USB drives outdated?
Help, she fainted!
Look, it's the Pole Star!
I've lost track of the days
He's in the restroom
We weren't afraid of anyone
Is it all right if I join you?
Of course.
The water isn’t cold, is it?
He shouldn't come back here
She's with him
He's with you
We're in a traffic jam
Tom isn't an Englishman
Tom isn't English
Don't get lost yet again
Maybe you're the problem, Tom!
He's not a hypocrite
He isn't a hypocrite
So let's learn Esperanto!
You’re not blind, are you?
It’s not hot, is it?
It’s not cold, is it?
The ship isn’t big, is it?
Thomas isn’t alive, is he?
It's as long as we wake up
Gringos aren't our friends
Don't eat before going to bed!
Crikey!
I don’t have strength to dig
I am ashamed to beg.
Was that an earthquake?
It is Earth's satellite
Independence or death!
I don't ride horses
Actually, she is a millionaire
Why don't you write?
We think, therefore we are
What did you do all day?
You aren't working hard
Yanni's breath smelt funky
Yanni clinched Skura's wrist
Yanni likes rock n' roll
Yanni's store is opening soon
Yanni is Ziri's best friend
She doesn't remember me
She can't remember it
She wasn't there
Yanni was calling Skura's name
Yanni's skin was gray
I thought I'd never see you
Wash your hands often!
Is that an astrolabe?
Let's run away!
Listen to what I will say!
Can you understand Finnish?
What a rude!
Have you tried screaming?
Which child is Masao?
Who invited them?
Do you really know her?
What a great friend you are!
In your opinion, is Tom right?
Is Tom right, in your opinion?
Ali's grandpa was a pharmacist
Is Tom denying this?
Did they visit Switzerland?
You didn't put me to sleep
You didn't visit Russia
I’m not picky
Ali's grandpa was a shoeshiner
Let's go if you're not sick
Ali's grandpa was a solderer
Are they not at home?
Take a book and read it!
Aren't we reading?
You're really clever
Don't demand anything of them
You don't need money now
You didn't visit Slovakia
Wow, your TV is really small!
The dog isn't sleeping
The cat isn't sleeping
Let the dog out, would you?
Don't bend over!
She's wonderful
Stop while you're ahead
What are you thankful for?
Why do I send you anything?
Let's make it!
Don't be a sore loser
He doesn't seem to remember me
Why do you hate America?
I couldn't let Tom leave
I totally get it, too
Ruth loves it, too
What's the second one?
I don't get it often
Also, it's probably true
I've seen that one around
It's a two-way street
That's not good or healthy
Maybe I'm speaking in truisms
That doesn't mean I wanted it
I love that band, too
It's never worthwhile
It's always toxic
I know that's a bad idea
I've never felt that
It's a difficult topic
It's a bit of a sore point
Tom's spam filter was too good
I'm freezing to death
Don't lean on the door
It was ages since I'd eaten
And what was this sound?
Yes, I cried this time
Actually, I know her
I'm not deceiving anyone
I'm getting my hair cut
The children weren't in bed
I can't read your thoughts
Was I too late?
Are you going to travel?
Ali doesn't have bad habits
I don't like to grumble
The answer wasn't right
I'm going grey
They're parents
He didn't want me to phone him
I'm going grey above my ears
Let his name be obliterated!
They're fathers
They're mothers
Not to worry though, right?
Yemach shmoy!
Yimach shemo!
Tom should've fallen years ago
Write it, please
What am I supposed to do then?
What should I do then?
My opinion hasn't changed
I can't look into her eyes
Whose horse is it?
Why not?
Are you as queer as I am?
Happy Pride!
No justice, no peace
What's-his-face is boring
Eat, eat!
Put a sweater on!
You want to catch a cold?
Don't swim right after you eat
Isn't that unconstitutional?
He's a staunch conservative
He's zealous but very flaky
You're an obligate carnivore!
You don't want my salad, cat!
Tom had John's pyjamas on?
Tom wore John's pyjamas?
Excuse me, is this yours?
Yes," she said, "you're right.
Haven't you heard the news?
What was that film called?
He's got to go there
She's got to go there
Haven't you seen this musical?
Haven't you seen that musical?
You've got to train more
You've got to practise more
What time is it now?
It's exactly 10 o'clock
Do you take cheques?
Actually that's not true
How have things been lately?
Who's that man?
Do you know him?
It's clear to everyone
It's obvious to everyone
Is that an express train?
He's dropped his dummy
Why wasn't she at the meeting?
The percolator isn't working
The percolator's not working
You've got to come tomorrow
Tom's sent me, Mary
Good morning, Mary!
Time to get up.
I don't want to get up yet
I want to sleep.
Gentlemen!
Dinner's in the oven
So, what was that about?
I'm a spy
I've worked for Tom
I'm coming on Monday
I'm a colonel
I'm here every Monday
I'm a shy boy
I'm different from Tom
I'm in a play
I'm in a spot
I'm a shopkeeper
I'll be coming with Tom
I'm a simple man
I'm a teacher of French
I'm a tour guide
I'm here for three days
All good?
I'm free all day
Does Mary have a husband?
I'm a slow reader
I'm an astrologer
I've asked Tom about that
What flavor is it?
Are they going, too?
I'm glad for three reasons
I'm an orthopedist
I assumed you'd go to Boston
I'm buying a house
I'm eating a donut
You didn't invent anything new
I'm Canadian and proud of it
I'm a house-husband
I'm envious of Tom's success
I'm an entrepreneur
I'll be home by three o'clock
I'm free until noon
She said he didn't believe her
I'm afraid that Tom will fail
I'm here on Mondays
I've already drunk three beers
I'm unemployed, too
I've spent some time in Boston
We've adopted a boy
Tom isn't being honest with me
I'm a man, not a boy
I'm a teacher myself
I'm good at juggling
I'm hungry right now
Are you homesick, too?
I'm going to the pool
I'll try to be on time
I'm a 13-year-old boy
I'm as happy as a clam
I'm disgusted with you
I'm an 11-year-old boy
I'm an eleven-year-old boy
I'm a thirteen-year-old boy
I'm free all afternoon
I'm good at basketball
I've apologized already
I don't like escalators
I'm a woman, not a girl
I'm afraid of everybody
I'm a 13-year-old girl
Do you eat a lot of meat?
I'm aware what day it is
I'm dying to be with you
We've drunk all the wine
All the wine's been drunk
Do you eat a lot of bread?
Do you eat a lot of fruit?
I can't stand being alone
I'm a mechanical engineer
I'm afraid of being fired
I'm not good with numbers
I'm very confused by this
Let's tear down this wall
There's no more wine left
I'm fed up with everything
I'm going abroad next year
I'm going to summer school
I'm not able to do that now
Please, please
I can't breathe, officer!
I'm very scared of spiders
I've already called a taxi
I've already called you a taxi
It's naive to believe that
I'm absolutely sure of that
I'm afraid I might get hurt
I'm always forgetting names
I'm an architecture student
It's afternoon coffee time
I'm hoping to do that today
I'll try to be there on time
I'm afraid to go there alone
I'm happy to hear your voice
Tom got married at twenty-six
I'm having trouble with this
Tom doesn't see you
She's tickling her daughter
You didn't specify the color
I've acknowledged my mistake
Tom is a pseudo-intellectual
I've already heard this joke
Who's cooking dinner tonight?
I don't know which one to buy
I haven't fully recovered yet
I'll try to get there on time
I'm considering changing jobs
I'm fed up with your behavior
Why do Sikhs wear turbans?
Are you a Sikh?

A soccer field every 6 seconds
I've done that with Tom a lot

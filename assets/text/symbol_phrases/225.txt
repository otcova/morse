I didn't ask for details
I couldn't do it anymore
I've got a deal for you
Tom is an easy-going guy
I've been reading a lot
I'm the oldest one here
I'm glad I wasn't there
I'd rather not tell you
It's my way or the highway
But she's not
Who is paying for this?
No one knows what's going on
Why aren't you at work?
Who's paying for this?
Who'll pay for this?
I don't know how I did that
I don't know how I did it
I'm really glad you came
Tom didn't stay for long
I've never spoken to Tom
I hope we'll meet again
I feel I've already won
I don't want to eat now
I'm not ready to fight
What is Tom really like?
What did Tom talk about?
What did Tom do instead?
I hope that it'll work
Tom isn't that handsome
I don't have any plans
I can't help you today
I'm tired of you guys
I'm sure I'll do that
It's time for Tom to go
I'd like to know more
I've seen Tom in action
I didn't want to lose
I'll never make it in time
I don't care what it costs
It's a stupid system
I shouldn't have lied to Tom
I never should've lied to Tom
Will you come with us, too?
They're both very pretty
It's about to die
What is the time there?
I can't trust you yet
Tom knows you're lying
I don't have a phone
I'm ready to fight
I can't find a job
I'm a country boy
How did Tom miss this?
I'm a city girl
I didn't panic
I love Tom's smile
Do you speak Hungarian?
Does he speak Tagalog?
I'm not inciting them
I don't scratch their backs
What color is the bird?
There's no guarantee
I didn't lie
I'm in my fourth month
Gold can't buy everything
When should I feed the dog?
I don't color their drawings
It's a funny movie
I'm not hesitating
I'm not putting you in a trap
Did you look at him?
It's a good movie
On what street?
How are you?
Very well.
Are you feeling too elated?
I don't think it will work
What needs to be done?
I hope I don't die today
I don't think you'll die today
Tom isn't going back to Boston
What's Tom up to in Boston?
We're not far from Boston now
Tom died in 2013 in Boston
I don't like living in Boston
I told Tom I'm from Boston
I'd love to live in Boston
Proceed!
Tom didn't want just any car
Tom's knife is on the table
Does she understand Hungarian?
Does he understand Hungarian?
Does he understand Italian?
Do you know Italian?
Are you the only ones here?
It's just not worth the risk
This is a game-changer
I wish you a good morning!
Don't forget to tell her that
Don't forget to tell him that
Are you sure he can do that?
It's worthless
Who is complaining?
You're pregnant
He's a doctor
He's American
She's American
It's American
Why does he hate me?
Why does she hate me?
They're like a married couple
He'll be back home tomorrow
Who's that?
It's your mother.
These lights are beautiful!
These cars are yours?
Yes, they're mine.
Are these cars yours?
Yes they are.
We're late!
Which of these dogs is yours?
Aren't these your books?
Do you call that a kiss?
Why are you crying?
It's just a movie
Do you come from Tokyo?
Is that actually true?
I'm glad I'm not like that
I didn't have to say it twice
He didn't have to say it twice
I've told you a million times
I've told you a thousand times
What are you doing?
Wrinkles?
The cow is at the farm, too
Where is the cow?
Where is the horse?
The cat is in the yard, too
Is it in the room?
Is the dog in the yard?
Is the book on the chair?
Is the book on the table?
Where is the apple?
Where's the table?
Is it a cow?
Is it a horse?
No, it is not a cat
Is this a cat?
Yes, it is a dog
Is this a dog?
It's an ice cream
It's a chair
May God give you a good night!
May God give you a good day!
Have a good time!
Hello, this is room service
Don't wait too long for me
Where is the bicycle?
Where is the plane?
Don't you ever have class?
I don't want to walk
Let's take a cab
And call me afterwards!
That's terribly expensive!
That's a rip off!
How sweet!
May God give us a good day!
I'm hoping to see them
Just that?
That's all?
You're wet
You're soaking
Are you going down?
He's bound to be late
Of course he'll be late
What a lie!
That's pure BS!
How sad!
I made a mistake!
I goofed!
He said "Hi" to me
Do you need sunglasses?
I'm coming!
Keep going!
Were you ever on television?
Oh crap!
It's urgent!
We're still waiting
You're Italian
Get out of here, you dog!
Bugger off, will you?
Behave yourselves!
Turn around!
Don't be late!
Ah, really?
For how long?
Til when?
Are you really coming?
It's just begun
Yes, you can
We're leaving soon!
We'll let him know
Does he work?
Does he have a job?
I'm bringing wine
I'll bring wine
What did he do?
That's enough!
You're naughty
Yeah, so what?
I'm angry!
I'm furious!
I'm pissed off!
Please, have a seat
May God give us a good night!
I'm Polish
Is there any extra charge?
Do you charge a commission?
Yes, of course!
How peaceful!
What an uproar!
How stupid!
I'm lost!
You really shouldn't have
It's the same
It's identical
I've hurt myself
I've been injured
Are you trying to get me mad?
Happy Birthday!
What sign are you?
How do I get to 5th Street?
Is Dad in the kitchen?
In Wales, we have a saying
Who is who?
That's a crap idea
What's your view on war?
Ken's dog is very fat
It's a pleasant feeling
There's no water in the bucket
How nice and soft it sounds!
Oh, that's very pretty!
Are you from Tokyo?
Tom's goal is to become famous
Make Britain great again!
Do you come from Beijing?
Do you come from Berlin?
Have you ever been to Spain?
Isn't your friend in town?
Would they be smaller?
I'll arrange that
Personally, I like peace
Isn't peace wonderful?
He's just a daydreamer
He's just a dreamer
I'm available now
Can the crisis be overcome?
I don't like fights
It's a black-and-white picture
He's got a couple screws loose
He's got a few screws loose
Did you say I'd never win?
Look!
A falling star!
I'm Hungarian
Aren't cookies delicious?
What is your goal?
Tom's birthday is October 20th
We'd better just call it a day
Please don't ask me to do that
Tom wasn't even here yesterday
We don't serve people like you
We don't want people like you
We don't need people like you
We're no angels
We're not angels
They're French
I'm three years older than you
I'm still in pretty good shape
I'm satisfied with the results
I'll think about what you said
I'll leave the planning to you
I'll be ready in a few minutes
Tom is also a friend of Mary's
I'd like to lose thirty pounds
Tom doesn't let me do anything
Tom didn't know Mary was there
I think it's still worth a try
Tom couldn't convince everyone
I hope we don't get in trouble
I hope I don't let anyone down
I don't want to see anyone die
I just wish I'd met Tom sooner
I don't think Tom is a bad guy
Apparently, Tom is still alive
Why is Tom acting so childish?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I've had this for a long time
Tom's pitching is pretty good
I'm going to be there tonight
Tom's injuries aren't serious
I'll never be able to do that
Tom's bicycle has been stolen
I'd like to know who did this
I've got lots of ideas
I've got tons of ideas
Eat if you're hungry!
I won't be doing this anymore
I think I'd be a good teacher
Tom said he doesn't know Mary
I don't want to walk any more
I don't think I deserved that
I don't have to study tonight
Tom isn't going to be a coach
Tom isn't allowed to go there
I didn't know what I would do
You're not obligated to come
Tom is one of Mary's brothers
We're going to have some fun
We'll have a good time there
I've had a great deal to do
I've got to lose some weight
I'm not ready to do that yet
I wouldn't want to work here
Tom doesn't have any shoes on
I wouldn't want to live here
Tom doesn't get much time off
God is, of course, omnilingual
Shhh, you'll wake up Tom!
Stick to what you're good at
Love, I find is like singing
Tom, do you love me?
Mary, do you love me?
I've ruined everything
I think I'd be a good father
Tom can't afford to be choosy
I know things you don't know
I'm going to miss Tom's smile
I know it's a risky business
I wonder what Tom's salary is
I know it won't be like that
Don't give up
I think Tom shouldn't do that
I knew that Tom wouldn't come
I don't think Tom was kidding
I don't think Tom trusts Mary
I don't think Tom is at fault
I just haven't done that yet
Tom's singing is pretty good
Don't mind the haters
What happened to your arm?
Do you love me, Tom?
Tom, do you love me?
Sure, I do.
Wise words!
You're very aggressive
You're being too aggressive
I just don't think like that
Tom wasn't there at the time
I just can't take it anymore
Tom wasn't seriously injured
Tom wasn't overly optimistic
Tom wasn't having a good day
Tom wasn't even on the plane
I hope I don't mess up today
Tom still can't grow a beard
I don't write poetry anymore
I don't worry about the risk
I don't worry about the past
It's difficult to understand
Have you ever been to Russia?
I think she's from Austria
Do you come from Moscow?
Do you come from New York?
I don't want to stop working
Tom said he hasn't seen Mary
I don't want to say anything
Tom said he couldn't do that
I don't want to blame anyone
I don't want to believe that
I don't want to be your wife
I don't think that'll happen
I don't think it's a problem
I don't think it'll work out
I don't see why this is news
I don't see the problem here
You can't abandon me
And what about you?
And how about you?
Officer down!
I'm asking you, so please stop
Nope!
I don't like Mexican food.
Who is your favourite singer?
Where is the assembly point?
Where are we assembling?
What is your favorite proverb?
I don't see any problem here
I don't see any harm in that
I don't really care about it
I don't plan on retiring yet
I don't mind doing it at all
I don't know who's there now
Tom looks like he's thinking
I don't know what you can do
I don't know how you do that
I don't have to say anything
Tom lived to be 90 years old
I don't have a job right now
Tom left the company in 2013
I've never flown first class
I'm not a tattletale
Don't worry about them
They're just jealous
Don't worry about him
He's just jealous
Don't worry about her
She's just jealous
Do you like historical novels?
I don't ever drink and drive
I don't care what's going on
I don't care about it at all
I don't believe we need that
I didn't want to do it again
I didn't get my way that day
Tom is the team's head coach
I didn't get a second chance
I didn't follow instructions
I didn't feel like going out
אילן is a synonym for עץ
Do you want to see the house?
Where is the wall?
I didn't do a good job today
I decided it wasn't too late
I couldn't do that to myself
I can't worry just about you
I can't wait until next week
I can't wait to meet you all
Let's hold that thought
Are you a movie star now?
No, silly.
You're so stuck up
I can't wait to get in there
I can't do anything about it
I can't add anything to that
I've still got to do my job
I've still got things to do
I've met so many new people
It's an honor to know him
You're my kind of people
I've known that a long time
I've heard that joke before
I've had a pretty good life
I've got to do this tonight
I've got stuff I want to do
I've got so much more to do
Tom doesn't like competition
I'm very proud of this team
I'm very excited to be back
Tom died from cancer in 2013
I'm trying to figure it out
Tom didn't take any pictures
I'm the owner of this house
Tom didn't stay out for long
I'm on my way to work now
I'll decide later
I'm thankful for everything
Tom didn't run the red light
I'm still trying to do that
Tom didn't let fear stop him
I'm still not sure about it
Tom didn't have to wait long
I'm sorry I opened my mouth
Tom didn't have to let me go
I'm really happy to be back
Tom didn't have long to wait
I'm pleased with what I did
Tom didn't have any boots on
I'm not sure which is worse
Tom didn't convince everyone
I'm not sure what they want
I'm not sure that I like it
I'm not supposed to do this
What's her occupation?
I'm not here to hurt anyone
I'm not going to let you go
I'm not even sure who he is
I'm just glad I got it done
I'm going to make this work
I'm going to get in trouble
Tom can't sneak up on anyone
I'm glad you're here today
I'm glad I watched the game
I'm glad I managed to do it
I'm glad I got here on time
I'm fed up with this system
Tom and Mary were there, too
I'm excited to be back here
I'm excited and ready to go
I'm doing what I love to do
I'll think about what I did
Tom and Mary both can't swim
I'll have a good time there
I'll be glad when it's over
I'd love to see that happen
Tom and Mary are like-minded
I'd hate to see that happen
I'd call that a coincidence
I wouldn't want to die here
Tom and John are Mary's sons
I won't have to do it again
I won't be staying with you
I won't be doing this again
I wasn't there at that time
I'd like to see what Tom has
I wasn't sure I could do it
I thought you'd like my tie
I don't think Tom lives here
I thought it was funny, too
I don't condone what Tom did
I can't just walk out on Tom
Have you ever been to England?
Why is Tom acting so stupid?
Tom was hired by us in 2013
I think they'll all be fine
I think it's still worth it
I think it's a terrible law
Tom says he's healthy again
I think it's a good project
I think it'll turn out fine
I think I'd be a good coach
Tom married Mary's daughter
Tom isn't very good at this
This is not a cat, it's a dog
Don't come here
I'm waiting for you here
Tom isn't the only guy here
I never thought I'd do that
Very good!
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
What's your name?
My name's Tom.
When will you call?
What we don't know is an ocean
Józsika is in the garden
Józsika is not in the house
We're actually early
I know that I won't like it
I know people think I'm odd
I know it's not good enough
Tom hasn't done a whole lot
I know I'll never forget it
Can he speak Spanish?
I haven't spoken to anybody
Tom doesn't play basketball
Tom doesn't plan to give up
Incoming!
He's charming and irresistible
Tom's car is stuck in the snow
Tom's car has run out of gas
Tom's car ran out of gas
Don't worry
Tom won't let us down
Did you taste this cake?
Is that train fast?
Tom didn't want to touch it
I guess you don't read much
Tom didn't want to be there
I guess that's a good point
Tom didn't identify himself
Tom didn't have much to say
I guess I'm not really sure
Tom didn't even want to eat
I gather it's not that hard
Tom didn't appear concerned
Tom can't do it all himself
Tom asked what you're doing
I feel it's a waste of time
I don't want to die in jail
I don't want to deceive you
I don't want to buy a yacht
I'm sure Tom regrets it now
I don't want to be reminded
I'm not sure what Tom means
I don't want to be negative
I'm not going to let Tom go
I don't understand politics
I'm not going to defend Tom
Tom doesn't intend to give up
It's too late to go there now
I don't want to mislead you
I haven't talked to anyone
Why didn't they come back?
Why didn't Tom come back?
What time should we eat?
What'll you eat today?
Who'll eat the rest?
I won't let Tom go
I won't defend Tom
I'm eating cereal
Tom won't eat it
Let's tell the truth
Let's speak out the truth
Let's never lie to each other
You're all very nice people
I'm sorry
What horrible things, Mary?
I'm sorry
I couldn't help crying
I don't think that's enough
I'm happy with what Tom did
I don't think I'll go today
I'm happy that Tom is happy
I don't think I deserved it
I'm going to miss Tom a lot
I don't take my job lightly
I told you I don't know Tom
I don't look at it that way
I don't like golf that much
I don't know who started it
I don't know what you think
I don't know what we can do
I don't know what caused it
I know it's not Tom's fault
That bird doesn't fly
I don't know how it happens
I know it isn't Tom's fault
I don't have a contract yet
I don't know much about Tom
I don't expect you to reply
I didn't want Tom to resign
I don't ever plan to retire
I didn't say I believed Tom
I don't care about the cost
I didn't want to work there
I didn't want to mess it up
I didn't want to give it up
Why is Tom acting so crazy?
I didn't want to be a freak
What's different about Tom?
I didn't think it was right
Tom's rights were violated
Love, Tom.
I didn't know who they were
Tom's performance was good
I didn't know what I wanted
Tom's parents were baffled
I didn't go there by myself
Tom's parents died in 2013
I didn't expect a job offer
Tom's parents believed him
Tom's had a very good year
Tom's condition is unknown
I believe that's a bad sign
Who's taking you home?
I've worked extremely hard
I've told you what I think
I've told them all to come
I've only been here a week
I've never understood this
I've never even shot a gun
I've never attacked anyone
Nevermore!
In his hand, lead became gold
I've heard that one before
Tom served 30 days in jail
I've got other commitments
I've done this a long time
Tom says he's not done yet
I've done that all my life
Tom says he's disappointed
I've done research on this
I've been really fortunate
Tom said he wasn't so sure
I've been pretty fortunate
I've been on a strict diet
I've been here long enough
I've been here a long time
How was the error observed?
This girl's eyes are blue
Were you ever in Kairo?
Where are my glasses?
There, where you left them.
Let me eat in peace, please
I'm afraid of the policemen
What happened to the car?
I've been doing that a lot
I've always been confident
Tom obviously wasn't happy
I'm still lonely sometimes
I'm really, really excited
I'm pretty tired right now
Tom knows it won't be easy
I'm pretty certain of that
I'm obviously disappointed
I'm not sure who they were
Tom isn't very charismatic
I'm not sure it's worth it
Tom isn't that type of guy
I'm not real proud of that
Tom isn't even on the team
This isn't my umbrella
I just hope Tom doesn't win
Tom wouldn't talk to Mary
Now you're speaking in riddles
What colour is the book?
What colour is the apple?
Let's build a sandcastle
I'm not one of those folks
Tom isn't a very smart man
I'm not going to deny that
I'm never going to give up
I'm never going to do that
I'm just playing it by ear
I'm just here to do my job
I'm happy the game is over
I'm going to need a sponge
I'm going to keep on going
Tom hasn't found a job yet
I'm going to have some fun
I'll never be as good as him
I'll never be as good as Tom
I'll never be as good as her
I'll never be as good as Mary
You'll never be as good as him
You'll never be as good as her
You'll never be as good as Tom
I'm going to give it a try
I'm going to fix it myself
I'm glad we didn't do that
I'm friends with everybody
I'm feeling very confident
I'm disappointed and angry
I'm convinced we can do it
I'm able to do what I want
I'm a little bit of a slob
I'm a bit pressed for time
Tom doesn't like punk rock
We can't do it without you
You'll never be as good as me
I'll never be as good as you
But you don't know
I'll write about this
Don't bathe in this water
I'll definitely buy ticket
Tom doesn't give up easily
I'll be better in a minute
Tom died in 2013 of cancer
I'll be back in touch soon
I'd much rather be at home
I'd like to be on the team
I'd like a house like this
I wouldn't put it that way
Tom didn't say it was easy
Tom didn't say a whole lot
I won't lend you any money
Tom didn't have a good day
I wish we hadn't done that
Tom didn't demand anything
I wish I'd never done that
I wasn't trying to be hero
I'm sorry to see Tom leave
Why are you accusing me?
Hopefully I won't get sick!
Hopefully, it'll rain tomorrow
I'm not mad at Tom anymore
I like Tom a lot, you know
I think they'll understand
I think it's a dumb theory
I suspect they're all gone
I know it'll be impossible
I hope you're doing OK now
I don't want to retire yet
I don't think we're losing
I don't think we need that
The cat doesn't like the dog
I don't think it'll happen
I don't think I'll make it
I don't see that happening
Tom didn't go to the bank
I've got a lot more to do
I'm sure it was a mistake
I'm ready to get out of here
I'm obligated to fix this
I'm glad you didn't do it
Pardon me!
I don't actually work here
The bite isn't very deep
Don't get me involved in this
I'm glad they're doing it
Why does Tom lie so much?
I'm feeling a lot of pain
I'd never come here again
I think that'll be enough
I know it'll take a while
Tom doesn't like fishing
I don't need one of those
Tom didn't disappoint us
I couldn't help but smile
I'll wash my apple
She's a little devil
Please don't ask me that
Let's ask Tom about that
I've read a lot of books
I'm so glad they're here
I'm in no hurry to leave
Tom should've said more
I'm in no hurry to do it
Tom said that wasn't so
I'm heavier than you are
Tom said he's not alone
I'm glad someone told me
I'm glad no one was hurt
I'm feeling a bit queasy
Who gave it to you?
It's about time to sleep
You don't have to reply today
I'm in no hurry to do that
I don't have time to travel
I don't work on weekends
I didn't want to give up
It's time to start over
I'm a little overweight
I'll be ready on Monday
I won't go to Australia
Tom didn't tell me this
ERROR: No body text!
You didn't need to eat quickly
Tom didn't much like it
Tom didn't like it much
I'm glad you helped Tom
I don't have to do that
I didn't finish the job
I've never shot anyone
Tom has questions, too
I've got so much to do
He's only in it for the money
She's only in it for the money
I've never shot a gun
Tom can't do it alone
I'm really very sorry
I know it's important
Tom isn't very tall
I'm glad Tom was OK
I don't have a garden
I've got a lot to do
I'm still just a kid
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Is Tom a Canadian?
Tom doesn't do much
What else did Tom do?
When did Tom do that?
I'm still a kid
Did Tom give you that?
Is Tom in any trouble?
Wasn't that nice?
He's reading a novel
She's reading a novel
Médus knocks on the door
Médus is knocking on the door
Unfortunately, no one told us
Where do you cook?
Where does she cook?
Where does he cook?
Italians don't give up easily
When did they fine you?
Let's let Tom speak
May I have a shilling, sir?
Stay in the garden, then!
Pass me the salt cellar!
Where was the black cat?
Where can the black cat be?
We're all riding our bikes
Shall I keep you informed?
Shall I keep you up-to-date?
You're at the station
I'm in the countryside
You're in the countryside
Shameful!
I won't wash the plates
I won't wash the dishes
We don't wash the plates
We don't wash the dishes
Is she sure?
Turn off the water!
That's what I was about to say
Does it seem that difficult?
Do you understand Hungarian?
I didn't go there
I guess it's time
What else did Tom eat?
You can't replace Tom
I'm hoping to win
I'm with Tom right now
I'm not going out
I'm old-fashioned
It's a great song
What else did Tom want?
I don't feel angry
A really lovely story!
I've found an apartment
I've planted a tree
I'm about to have lunch
Thank you all very much!
It's been switched
As I was tired, I went home
Is Tom better than Mary?
I'm still in shape
Do you still believe Tom?
Is Tom still dating Mary?
Tom isn't very good at cooking
It's time for me to go to bed
You don't have to answer today
Who did you get it from?
Is it too little?
Er..
Hmm..
Let's focus on that
I don't write poetry
I'm glad that's done
Tom isn't seeking asylum
I'm heavier than you
I'm very fond of you
Do you feel sorry for Tom?
It's a difficult job
Why are you offended?
I have enough!
Don't change a winning team
I couldn't rent a car
I think that's a hoax
Tom didn't like that idea
Tom doesn't seem to agree
I won't stay with you
I don't understand art
Tom says he's ready to go
Tom's father was a pastor
I'm no longer a rookie
Tom's mother died in 2013
What will Tom and Mary do?
I guess it's time to go
Thanks, Tom
Where was Tom last Monday?
I'm a bit old-fashioned
How long can Tom stay here?
We're located in Boston
Frankly, I don't like it
I don't expect Tom to help
I hope Tom doesn't do that
I shouldn't say anything
I'd be happy to join you
This paper doesn't absorb ink
I'm sorry, I don't think I can
It's not important!
How much do the oranges cost?
Can you keep quiet?
I'm very worried about Tom
We didn't argue about it
Why are you two fighting?
Tom could've hurt me worse
Tom didn't get off the bus
I'm much heavier than you
Tom doesn't like that idea
I'm not going out tonight
I'm very happy to be back
Let's not let that happen
Who organized the meeting?
I've been stabbed three times
Check out these dank memes!
I guess it's time to leave
Tom said that's no problem
I'm a lot heavier than you
Tom says that won't happen
My father won't allow that
What are Tom's options now?
Why do you care about this?
Where was Tom last weekend?
Did Tom not know what to do?
I don't know why they do it
I don't care who Tom kisses
I don't care who kisses Tom
I'm feeling really grumpy
I guess it's PMS
I don't know why Tom is fat
I'm very glad that I did it
We haven't discussed it yet
I'm worried about all of you
I don't know anyone in Boston
I don't understand modern art
No, I am not an escort
That's pretty
What's on TV now?
Is Tom one of the finalists?
We're not wealthy
Is that the best Tom can do?
Let's not forget who Tom is
Is she here?

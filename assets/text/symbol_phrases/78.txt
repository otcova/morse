Friends of yours?
Then, yes.
To be honest," said Dima
Noobs," Al-Sayib stated
Noobs?
This is real life!
So why'd you call?
To hire a good lawyer?
Al-Sayib asked
No," Dima replied
I'm dirty, remember?
Oh, boy...
Al-Sayib sighed
Well, how much do you need?
I need 99 kopeks.
Dima...
Al-Sayib said
But it's true!
Can't you wire me some money?

Whose cup is this?
May I ask why you did that?
May I ask who's calling?
May I ask why you sent for me?
May I ask why you're calling?
May I ask why you're here?
How can you stand this smell?
What needs to be done next?
There's a lot more work to do
Do you know who I am?
I'll be waiting in Algiers
He's probably in Algiers
I was bitten by Tom's dog
I'm no exception either
I'm not about to do that
I'm not about to resign
I'm very happy that happened
It's not a new technique
It's not a new argument
I'll be released soon
I'll be retiring soon
It'll take lot of time
Long live the 1st of May!
Long live the first of May!
These methods aren't new
That's an alarming sign

That guy's name is Tom
That girl's name is Mary
I'd do the same for Tom
That's no longer the case
There's no one to help us
There's nobody to help us
It's only half past four
Who doesn't have problems?

I'll have to work until I die
I'll have to work till I die
No one knows how it'll end
Nobody knows how it'll end
That's food for thought
These aren't very important
This statement is false, too
Is unemployment rising again?
I'm fed up with this job
We can't trust those people
I've had many bad experiences
Who'll pay us those losses?
We don't have a crystal ball
Could it be Tom?
Tom's appeal wasn't successful
I'm not going after her
I can't speak about that now
I could say that's my dream
I don't consider myself lucky
I wasn't as fat back then
It's already proving useful
That's something we don't need
It's something we don't need
We don't need this
That's no longer applicable
The date isn't yet finalized
The timing wasn't accidental
We're going to consider it
We'll consider it
We don't know what to do next
What sort of life do you live?
What sort of life do you want?
It's a difficult time for us
There's nothing to eat here
Nothing's changed since then
That's exactly what we needed
There's no other alternative
The situation hasn't changed
We don't have to do any more
We've already done our part
We've lost all our equipment
We're always going to be here
We're both Canadians

I'd like a week off with pay
I'd like to order drinks now
We'd like to order drinks now
I'd like to come and see you
I'm allergic to penicillin
I've been in the hospital once
We're afraid we'll be killed
Where does Tom really work?
Nobody knows who's responsible
No one knows who's responsible
We've been harassed before
That's got to stop right away
That's got to stop right now
You're manly
I'm walking
We didn't start the gunfire

Some people think that I'm Tom
I think that we'd better go
I think that we'd better leave

We think that you're right
I think that it's time we left
Where did you buy this bread?
Can you ski?
Yes, I can.
How about Tom?
Yes, he can ski, too.

Is Kuki a dog or a cat?
That probably didn't happen

He's probably exaggerating
No, I cannot afford it

My happiness, I owe it to you
Nobody's ever been there
Where is Tom?
I'd like to see him
Tom doesn't ski, does he?

I hope it's not cold tomorrow
I hope it's not hot tomorrow

How will we get there?
What's your favorite team?
That probably won't happen
I doubt that that'll happen
I doubt that'll happen
Tom hit me, not Mary
Tom kissed me, not Mary
Tom took Mary's book

Tom didn't have a coat on
Mr. Jackson teaches us history
Tom didn't stop the car
I think that it's going well
Do you think that Tom is OK?
I think that that's right
I guess that that's true
I suppose that that's true
Well, I think that Tom's right
I think that this'll work
I think that it'll be OK
Translate it, please

Tom couldn't get the job
Should I have to know it?

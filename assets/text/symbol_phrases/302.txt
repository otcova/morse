We can't do that right now
We can't hide here anymore
I told Tom to be home by 2:30
When did Tom buy his umbrella?
We're looking for treasure
What causes a panic attack?
Who does your laundry for you?
Do you do your own laundry?
I'm self-sufficient
At what time is she going?
Will I answer her honestly?
She is smart, isn't she?
Have you woken up?
What do you want to be?
What color is your bicycle?
Why are you being followed?
Tom is eating, too
Why are you being so quiet?
Who did Tom kill?
I'm no longer friends with Tom
Why are you coughing today?
Why are you leaving school?
When did Tom buy that sweater?
Why are you still in there?
Why did you lie about that?
Why exactly do you do that?
Don't make yourself nervous!
Don't talk so loud!
It's exactly as you told me
It appears you're all mistaken
Are you OK, bro?
That's beyond our power
Would you need my help?
Leo's travelling to Venus
I don't write letters often
It's gorgeous out today
I'm from the United States
I'm from the USA
Where is your phone?
It is only ten yuan!
That is 30 metres long
I hope everything goes well!
Can you?
I'm from Berlin, Germany
I'm from Costa Rica
I'm from Uzbekistan
Are you Polish?
It's quite nice here
That's thirty meters long
I don't often write letters
You can't go back in there
I've learned so much about Tom
Why is your car still here?
Just admit that you're wrong
You're deluding yourselves
When did Tom get that sweater?
You don't need to dress up
What the hell?
Studying is a student's work
Fax!
I wouldn't like to lie to her
You don't listen!
How do you think I look?
Very pretty.
What street did he take?
You don't work less than me
Freedom isn't free
I can't quit my job
Was that what you wanted?
I've made some coffee for us
I've made us some coffee
It's raining a lot!
I can't see out of my left eye
I can't get the stove to light
I can't find clothes to fit me
I can't express how sorry I am
I can't believe a word you say
I can't attend today's meeting
I can't allow Tom to go abroad
I can't stand people who brag
I can't remember where we met
I can't get my suitcase open
I can't get this door locked
I can't give you any details
I can't make it there in time
I can't find anything I need
I can't decide who to invite
I can't afford to waste time
I can't talk about that now
I can't find my other sock
I can't find my other glove
I can't decide what to wear
I can't dance to this music
I can't come until tomorrow
I can't untie my shoelaces
I can't sleep on the floor
I can't sleep on airplanes
I can't read Tom's writing
I can't pretend any longer
I can't find my other shoe
I can't find a clean shirt
I can't afford to get sick
I can't work in this heat
I can't get this nail out
I can't get this box open
I can't afford to eat out
I can't seem to get warm
I can't resist chocolate
I can't take the strain
I can't reach that high
I can't hear you at all
I can't quite remember
I can't go out tonight
I can't digest lettuce
I can't stop yawning
I can't see you now
I can't come today
We'll visit Tom next week
He opened the door!
I don't write many letters
As soon as you finish, get out
Let's assume you're right
So what?
Has she betrayed your trust?
Do you want to go there?
Mary ironed Tom's shirt
Tom stayed at a B&B
Tom came to Mary's school
I can't believe your team won
I can't believe Tom got fired
I can't comment on that
We didn't have much water
I can't fire Tom
He's our best worker
I can't do anything today
There's no salt in this shaker
We don't have any ketchup left
We're out of ketchup
This isn't useful at all
When did Tom learn to do that?
Do you know that man's name?
Do you know how to get home?
Are you two going to Boston?
It's cold outside
Don't believe a word Tom says
He's lying through his teeth
Now you are here, help me
He's prepared
She's prepared
I'm not your property
Do you have a woollen blanket?
Does your hotel have a name?
You don't want to believe Tom
Do you think this will burn?
Doing that wasn't an option
Don't get yourselves killed
How did you like the picnic?
I've been to the station
In my opinion, Tom's right
We assume it's natural
We assume that it's natural
I'm not homesick
There's no reason not to stay
Look, there's a cafe here
Was it here before?
I don't support that theory
My car is not red, it is blue
Don't let him lose hope
This cucumber is very long!
Why is she crying?
The stairs have up to 22 steps
No, you cannot use my car!
Mom cooked some tasty food!
I am a genius!
We made it!
Isn't that great!
This is not a cat, it is a dog
People say he's competent
They say he's competent
I don't like champagne
He'll leave Japan in April
When did Tom lose his car key?
It's too late to call Tom now
Don't you recognize me?
I'm Tom
How much do carpenters make?
It's started raining again
I've never been on a plane
I'm going to buy clothes today
My car isn't red
It's blue
My car's not red
It's blue
Tom is tall, and strong, too
Tom doesn't have a passport
Down with neutralism!
I’m just as hurt as you
I’m just as hurt as you are
I've suffered as much as you
Where were you two?
I'll clean the kitchen later
You aren't a nice person
What do you want to be?
I didn't even know about it
Tom is scared, too
I didn't do this on purpose
I can't be with you all day
Tom has Asperger's
Tom has Asperger's syndrome
No one saw us, I hope
The dog licked Tom's face
That's why people come here
Don't sit there
That's Tom's seat
I don't often drink tequila
Why did Tom ask that question?
I don't need three bicycles
Living with Tom won't be easy
I don't eat bread every day
Nobody saw us, I hope
I'm probably too old
I'm apparently too old
What are they laughing at?
He doesn't eat
I don't like eating meat
She's pretty ugly
Viva Maduro!
No, I didn't.
Is the oven really closed?
Are you speaking or not?
He has what I lack; confidence
A glass of wine, please
I don't want to be selfish
Have you washed?
Juan is 35 years old today
I don't have a treadmill
Happy year of the rooster!
It is yours to give!
Where is Marika working now?
Tell me, where were you born?
365 days have passed
Ah well, you're out of luck!
You're really lucky!
Which train do you take?
You don't understand that
We don't know English at all
I didn't do them up
I can't go any more quickly
Hello, are you Ana?
Hey, sleepyhead, wake up!
Unfortunately, I must refuse
Why do you want me?
Is the house beautiful?
I am going out, aren't you?
Can I pay by Visa?
I don't have time to meet you
She has almond-shaped eyes
Run as fast as you can!
The house was built in 1960
She is terribly ill-humoured
First food, then morality
This is a man-made language
We don't sell beer
Why does Tom still have those?
I haven't had breakfast yet
Needless to say, Tom was late
I haven't finished my story
Tom is sleepy, too
I'd like some chocolate cake
Tom's daughter is beautiful
Why is Linda here?
Tom can't eat with chopsticks
That's beyond my control
Tom is my sister's friend
I just wasn't strong enough
We've matured
You like apples, don't you?
You're my daughter
It's Sarah's apple
I didn't give Sarah the apple
Has your phone connected?
She is angry, and still tired
When is breakfast?
There's nothing on TV
Nothing's on TV
What was the reason for it?
That is extremely hot!
No, Charlie is in Spain
He's sick
That's why he didn't come
He's sick
That's why he hasn't come
She's sick
That's why she didn't come
She's sick
That's why she hasn't come
Why does Tom think I did that?
We've been up all night
Perhaps we'll find it
What Tom did wasn't wrong
Let's hope that Tom was right
What a pity Tom can't come!
They're more emotional than us
We'd better leave Tom alone
We should adopt Tom's proposal
I hope it'll clear up soon
Do you have a match?
Sorry, I don't smoke.
I talked to Melissa yesterday.
Who is Melissa?
History is life's lover
Am I a good teacher?
Shall we take a bath together?
Are we going to have a tour?
Isn't this his car?
Shark soup or whale steak?
He didn't have another choice
Please don't forget it!
Will you help me then?
Should I go to the party?
In sad times, comedy blooms
Who gave Greece so much money?
Tom and Mary don't like me
I won't tell you my address
I'll be here until I retire
I'd rather eat Chinese food
I wouldn't want to say that
The phone rang, waking Tom up
I wouldn't make you do that
I'm excited to just be here
I'll pay this bill tomorrow
The TV shouldn't be so close
Isn't that good?
You ruined my BMW!
When can we use this until?
Is this a pussycat?
I'm the continental champion
He's done that again and again
I'm not his friend
I'm not her friend
I've been at the station
You've been at the station

I'm interested in carpentry
I'm glad everything went OK
I'm familiar with this area
This isn't toilet paper
We can rely on Tom's judgement
Please record Tom's speech
Tom's speech bored me
Q.E.D
You're watching
''All men must die.''
''All men must serve.''
What do we say to death?
I can't read them, anyway
In any case, I can't read them
What type of food do you like?
You weren't thirsty
You don't ski
Does the plane go to Geneva?
He's an extraordinary person
What Tom did isn't wrong
We've planted the garden
Don't touch the exhibits
Please don't speak so loudly
Don't look out of the window
Don't look out the window
We'd better sit down here
We've already won this battle
I've lost one of my folders
You weren't scared, were you?
I've begun a new diet
I need to be there before 2:30
We've refused
Aha, so this is Mrs. Evans!
Mrs. Sklodowska was a woman
What a clever boy Tom is!
It's a homophobic remark
Ankle, ankle, where are you?
You don't look bad yourself

I don't like your movie
Do you have to wait?
His English is very fluent!
She is rich, but unfortunate

You don't need to tell me
Do you want to be beautiful?
He doesn't drink alcohol
How is that going?
Thanks, sorry for being late
I don't like eating apples
Have you kissed her?
María didn't know what to say
Could I speak with Anna?
Yes, yes, I am going with you
They're all studients
I'd very much like to go
I'm just joking, Tom
Don't be daft
Were you faking?
Were you faking it?
You're good at faking
I'm not falling for that one
That's my favorite painting
We might've misunderstood Tom
We're apt to make mistakes
We don't have snow here
You don't have to do it now
Do you guys live in Norway?

He's an art history specialist
Did you just get back?
Did you just arrive?
Go clean your room!
Don't make me get the belt
The bathroom wasn't very clean
The bathroom isn't very clean
I'm invincible
Kids think they're invincible
We'd love to work with you
You'd better stop smoking
You'd better leave at once
You should've seen the picture
You should've seen the movie
I know you can come!
Hey, what do you like to eat?
Are you fed up of desserts?
Have you been to Brazil?
How do you say that in Berber?
Is Berber your mother tongue?
I'm not allowed to go outside

Yankev says he's done
Do you buy it?
I'll get to work
Who is the better hunter?
Promise me you'll come
I wake up at 8:00
I wake up at eight o'clock
Oranges aren't vegetables
See you at about 2:30
You're a bad boy
That's a beautiful butterfly
Tom might've just forgotten
There's no place except here
There's no moment except now
They won't be disappointed
Have you bought a cantaloupe?
She is going on the 25th
I don't like wearing socks
Do you work at the hospital?
Yes, I am Xiaoyu
Who are you?
Can Tom play the guitar?
Aren't they Canadians?
Did you buy a cantaloupe?
We couldn't overtake Tom
We're sure of Tom's honesty
Moloch!
Moloch!
Nightmare of Moloch!
Moloch the loveless!
Mental Moloch!
Can you also count in French?
I'm pretty hungry right now
I'm not scared of policemen
I'm not interested in music
I'm not disappointed at all
I'm more than just a singer

I can't speak English fluently
What is in the living room?
Today is the 25th July
Can you re-do it for me?
Close, but no cigar
They didn't believe Mary
You're going into the city
Did Tom pass the test?
Did Tom pass the exam?

Supposedly, she's a good cook
Do you have any free time?
There's someone at the door
You're to blame
How powerful is China?
There isn't anyone
There's no one
I've asked Tom why he was sad
Do you really not like me?
You're trying to kill me
Is he aware of his mistakes?
Don't keep dodging the subject
I don't think that at all
I don't want to lead you on
It's a sensitive subject
I'm not stupid, you know
I didn't want to lead him on
She didn't want to lead him on
Did you work in Australia?
Did you take Tom home?
Do you have a house in Boston?
I'm sorry if I offended you

We haven't yet succeeded
Plans haven't been finalized
I haven't been around much
We haven't yet begun to fight
Do you know Tom's number?
Where's the vodka?
Do you think I'm insane?
This cork won't come out
That's money down the drain
I'm accustomed to the climate
What's the title of the book?
If you're wrong, then so am I
Do you know Tom's family?
Let's out for a short walk
I'm pretty lonely right now
I'm pretty scared right now
I'm pretty sleepy right now
I'm really not that worried
I'm still waiting to see it
I've almost made up my mind
I've always been overweight
I'm going to keep this one

Berber isn't that difficult

I don't think this is correct
It's your turn to play
It's Tom's turn to play
Tom's nose began to itch
Tom whispered Mary's name
Both can't be true
Is that a yes?
So you've known all this time?
I can't live a lie anymore
Tom hadn't had time to change
Mary hadn't had time to change
Tom grew up in the 80s
Tom grew up in the 90s
Tom grew up in the 2000s
That's money wasted
It's too noisy here
I can't concentrate
I've just unlocked the door
If you want to dance, dance
It wasn't easy getting here
It's time you got a haircut
Let's see if we can do that
I can't get Tom to eat spinach
Please don't be so impatient
You're tallest
Finally, we got to Boston
The news didn't surprise us
You're allowed to go
I'm writing a message to Tom
It's not very spicy
It isn't very spicy
It's very hot this morning
I'm afraid I've lost it
I'm afraid that I've lost it
I'm not a handyman
What's the situation like?
This time I won't come back
Don't make me get my belt
That's a pack of lies
Let's talk about this later?
Now's our chance to do that
Stop insulting me!
Don't close it!
It is very warm today!
They don't like dancing
Hey!
Let's start eating

She doesn't feel anything?
Did you go to Hokkaido?
It's not really that spicy
How did you find this?
When did Rome fall?
They're very pretty

You've known all this time?
We weren't ready for it
I can't anymore
I'm sorry
We'd better throw it away
Tom's wife died of cancer
Tom's wife passed away
You can't blow and sip
I don't think much of him
This ticket is non-refundable
Why do I feel like an idiot?
I'm not used to the job yet
We'll need more time
I can't help Tom do that today
We can't predict the future
We're almost ready to leave
I'm addicted to nicotine
I couldn't get the gate open
What's in the living room?
Who's the better hunter?
How many are there?
Don't ask me; I'm a cat
When's your b-day?
Nothing's on television
There's nothing on television
Do you play football?
Don't worry
What do you see in this image?
Don't be scared
Don't worry
Do you want to visit Brazil?
What is your full name please?
Okay?
Type your name, please
Okay?
So who's left in the store?
So who's still at the store?
Damn, it's moving
Are you ready for adventure?
Are you ready for adventures?
Having done his work, Tom left
I've run short of money
I've often been here
I've been here many times
I haven't read all the books
I've read that book before
Once Tom arrives, we can start
We're sold out of jeans
At last, we reached Boston
We're anxious for your help
We've seen three wars
We aren't cold in the house
We'll fight to the last
What type of gas is it?
We didn't have rolls
Then, he moved to Kyoto
That's so expensive!
Can't you get it cheaper?
And the one on the right?
Let's get a move on!
I've eaten one apple
Have you seen the red river?
I must've mistyped the number
He's a slave
Don't you have a phone number?
Do you want a small oven?
Follow me, please
We're anxious about her health
We've had bad weather recently
Let's clean up the whole desk
I went to play!
Is she still sleeping?
I don't want to be right
Who used all the hot water?
Marie-Emmanuelle is French
I bet you didn't know this
The math doesn't add up
Why are you still at school?
Why are you in the hospital?
Why are you acting so crazy?
What time did the party end?
I didn't expect Tom to be late
What color is your umbrella?
We're desperate for answers
He wouldn't raise my salary
It isn't really that spicy
The two cases aren't related
It's Tom's turn to pay
It's too noisy here
The sun hasn't risen yet
I'd like to buy some cheese
Which ones would you like?
The lid won't open
He doesn't listen to music
Why are you visiting Boston?
Why did you throw that away?
Why do you want to buy that?
I didn't lie to Tom about that
Why is this website so slow?
Don't mess around
Where's the men's room?
Who is this old person?
I don't want to go right now.
Why not?
You're so stupid!
I want to find him first!
I donʼt know
You're one of my best friends
What's that number?
When did they pass that law?
I don't think Tom has a dog
What time is she at home?
If you can sing, that is great
Well then, have you decided?
Where did you run to?
I didn't work
Thank you!
Did you go to school?
Give it a go!
Is he a good teacher?
What did he really tell you?
How much does this pen cost?
Those apples aren't yet ripe
Hey!
Yes, his surname is also Tom
Tom's full name is Tom Tom
Since you can, you should!
What subjects are you good at?
Well, let's go on!
It's extremely expensive
Do not confuse me like that!
I am Chaoui, I speak Berber
That's why
That's quite a risky job
That's a pretty risky job
Tom got a 30% pay raise
Tom wouldn't eat anything
My children won't eat fish
Everyone, wake up!
Why are you so energetic?
You all did an amazing job!
Do you want my phone number?
I'm very good
I'm feeling younger again
Did you change it?
No, we are the same age
Don't eat that, it's expired
Who do you think is wrong?
Who do you think is to blame?
It's tea time
It's time to play
It's time that you shut up
I don't like the pineapple
Let me work, please!
You like to walk barefoot?
Come on!
A little faster!
They know Mary's father
Deeds, not words
Can you give me an example?
You only think of money!
I don't want to wait longer
This just doesn't add up!
How about this instead?
No, thank you.
I can't lift this container
Who can replace her?
Who was it that gave you that?
When was it you first met Tom?
You've confused the students
How long was the concert?
Who can replace them?
Are you Chaoui?
Are you Chaouis?
How often do the buses depart?
Is this your apple?
What do you think she can do?
He has 20 children
He's Finnish
She's Dutch
I don't know when I'll be home
Please!
I'm losing consciousness
How are you?
I'm fine.
Do you know what I'm doing?
Wear silk socks!
And I answered: Here I am
You know it can't last forever
Do you have reservation?
Don't interrogate me
In my opinion, you're stupid
We've never lost hope
I'll pick you up at noon
He's my own flesh and blood
I couldn't tell Tom to leave
He's my own flesh and blood
How do you like Moscow?
Why should I trust you now?
This isn't a school
It's a hospital
Mary is my brother's wife
Mary is my sister-in-law
You can't go downstairs now
You can't help how you feel
Tom borrowed Mary's pencil
He's in the mosque
I'm not going to the mosque
It's hot in this mosque
This mosque doesn't have AC
Are you Lebanese?
Are you Syrian?
I don't understand Berber
I'm wearing a Kabyle dress
I can't study Berber
We lived in Kabylie, Algeria
I'm in Berber class
Does she like China?
She's afraid of the sea
Larbi Ben M'hidi is Algerian
Look, it's so pretty!
I don't dare to kill animals
Do you finally understand?
Don't sigh like that
Don't sigh
There's no need to lie
I couldn't get my point across
No, it isn't easy
That's too complicated for me
I might eat a snack at 2:30
What'll we tell Tom?
What'll we tell the others?
Does Tom know me?
Why's Tom looking at me?
Why did Tom remain in Boston?
Wasn't Mary your girlfriend?
I'll be right back
Is Tom healthy?
Where did Tom buy these books?
They said it couldn't be done
Was the French test difficult?
Where are you studying French?
I often go to Kabylie, Algeria
I'm going to Kabylie, Algeria
I'm in Kabylie, Algeria
She's from Kabylie, Algeria
I study abroad, in Algeria
I study in Kabylie, Algeria
I flew to Kabylie, Algeria
He's talking to me in Berber
What are you doing in Kabylie?
Let's go together to Kabylie
Are Kabyle dresses expensive?
Her name is Taninna.
What a cool name!
It's a Kabyle name.
He is from Kabylie, Algeria
Where is my cactus?
On the windowsill.
He's dating a Kabyle girl
He said he was Kabyle, too
In short, it was a great party
It's never easy to say goodbye
Please don't make me go there
I can't speak French fluently
Do you intend to go to Boston?
Did you pass your French test?
There isn't anyone in there
I know exactly where I'm going
It's slippery
Tatoeba is an amazing website!
We aren't related by blood
They're policemen
They're police officers
What hope is there of a cure?
Do you speak Aragonese?
Then I'll prove it to you!
Leave all hope!
This here isn't America
Who knows where she was?
We don't have classes tomorrow
I prefer poetry in French!
I'm not going to walk there
You're deceiving yourselves
Tom couldn't escape
I'm a Canadian citizen
I'm so not cool
I'm glad I saw Tom
I'm not a great singer
I'm too old for Mary
I'm sure Tom will go
I'm good at giving advice
I'm after Tom
I'm teaching French
I'm going to buy this book
I'm 30 years old
They would be speechless.
Yes, of course
There's no getting around it.
You're drop-dead gorgeous

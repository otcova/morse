It's absolutely ridiculous
Ghosts don't exist
He's a ghost hunter
She's a vampire hunter
Tom, get us out of here!
I've seen her before
I've seen him before
It's fun to go out with her
It's fun to go out with him
Is that even possible?
Why is that wrong?
You're such a good friend
Will you join me?
You shouldn't have come here
I shouldn't have come here

This is outrageous!
This isn't healthy
What do they want?
What does he want?
What's the minimum wager?
What's the minimum wage?
Tom, answer me!
Can you show it to me?
Will you show it to me?
We're making progress
I'm making progress
You can't ask me to do that
You can't ask him to do that
You can't ask her to do that
I'll never do it again
There's no way of telling
He's a florist
I can't watch this anymore
It's just a game
He's part of the 1%
Do we have to go?
I wasn't ready for it
He wasn't ready for it
She wasn't ready for it
Get out of my sight!
It's my personal favorite
He's a bad influence
She's a bad influence

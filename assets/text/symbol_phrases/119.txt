Yes.
You don't need to do sports
It is only the cat's fault
I'm quite satisfied
It's his Christmas present
He's just lazy
So, I'm arrived
Well, what do you think of me?
It's not higher math
I don't know how I did it
Way to go!
Attaboy!
Don't you have nausea?
Turn off the damn camera!
Not tonight, I have a headache
Turn to the left!
He is beautiful like a god!
What is the file extension?
Today I'm feeling melancholic
Relax!
I'm sure of my sentence
He's sketching an apple
You have lost, give up!
Go to the doctor at once!
Where can I buy silk?
Those were the days!
Give me the cup of coffee!
I'll go buy some bread
Let me go, you're choking me
There isn't a cloud in the sky
I'll leave this with you
Didn't you see my keys?
You aren't Mr. Lima.
No, I'm his son.
I can't believe it!
No way!
That must have hurt!
Did I get you?
You didn't write anything
Can I rely on you?
He's young, maybe too young
She's young, maybe too young
It's neat and clean
He's got a point
Tom got to know Mary's friends
I'm sorry Mother
What's he hiding?
It's a beautiful rug
What did you like about it?
Why you give him this gift?
What are you good at?
What is your greatest project?
It's so easy
It's not a fish
It isn't a fish
For them, it was the end
It's absolutely disgusting!
I like languages!
Not another goalless draw!
It isn't important
Could you see me off?
You're over-thinking this
It's your duty
Tom is hard-working
That's such a wonderful thing
It wasn't a request
Let's conquer the world
I'm snowed under with work
Unfortunately, he had to leave
Please don't do that again
I'm sorry
I didn't catch your name
That's ridiculous!
That's definitely the goal
You'd make a good diplomat
He's tripping balls
What did you think?
Where did they go?
Where is law college?
The pressure is on!
I travelled on shank's pony
That doesn't sound good
I hear what you're saying
I'm in the middle of something
Can you call me back?
I'll be back," said Tom
Don't read too much into it
Don't read too much into this
I'll do something
This is not a toy!
Are you pointing at me?
I've done nothing wrong
Don't think I don't like you
It's not that at all
It's just the opposite
Are you trying to distract me?
I didn't sleep enough
I'm already hungry
I'm familiar with the subject
I'm familiar with this subject
Today I'm online
It's usually a good thing
Tom doesn't use steroids
Mary is wearing a T-back
I'll take a stab at it
That's icky
This product is well-designed
Don't blame me
Tom wasn't strong enough
(N.Nazarbayev)
Ready, steady....Go!
Get set ...
Go!
Ready, set, go!
Lights, camera, action!
They're a motley crew
It's all in your head
It's a quarter till two
You're right about that one
Visit us please!
I'm going to rest, OK?
Can you read Arabic?
It's not you, it's me!
I hear you five-by-five
I'm feeling confused
I'm feeling dizzy
Next year I'll go to the sea
It's happening
That's troubling
Tom can't wait to get started
It’s a different beast
Now she's gone mad
Go on like this!
It's the only explanation
I'd approve both things
Don't count me in
It's weird isn't it?
Don't fret
Ain't that cute?
He's not in the mood
She's not in the mood
It's bullshit
What about his girlfriend?
You're shitting me
Gotta catch 'em all
Tom's new book is about Mary
Tom doesn't use drugs
What difference does it make?
Don't take the bait
What was she like?
It's a piece of shit
She's as sweet as honey
You can't learn that in school
Yes, you did
Were you drinking?
Why take the risk?
I'll meet you there
Where does Iain live?
I'm only a man
What a delay!
It's perfectly equal!
They're Russian
My father doesn't drink liquor
What nonsense!
Tomorrow I'll cut you
You're soaking wet
You're a nice girl
Stop meeting famous people!
The plane departs at 5:30 PM
That's exactly why I came!
Do I have permission?
Most probably, he'll come
Most probably, she'll come
I've got diarrhea
When is peak sentences?
I'm going to see her today
David's sick, right?
That's unbelievable
Eat all your spinach!
I think he's tired
We couldn't convince him
What a shot!
It's too little, too late
It's a legitimate worry
He's known for that
Tom is playing with his yo-yo
He did it not once, but twice
Can he keep it going?
I've never seen that before
He's a liar
I'll keep my lips sealed
Fight with me!
Did you go to the book fair?
Good, but you can do better
Do fish sleep?
It's a slippery one
My pen-drive has a virus
There's a lot of chit-chat
What in the hell is this?
They're all chasing Tom
It's the next logical step
He didn't quite hit it there
It's one of those moments
Many sailors can't swim
Tom was rescued by a passer-by
The transition won't be easy
Don't mess with Tom
It isn't over yet
That's a good tee shot
Don't let the dog inside
Tom, I feel very alone tonight
That's why people liked me
Is the anesthesiologist there?
For what reason?
How did you get in?
Do you have a key?
Did someone follow us here?
Tom visited Mary's grave
They're of human origin
He's the one who touched me
There's nothing to it
Love me tomorrow!
Are you guys seeing that?
It's Friday!
It's very small and cramped
It's very small and narrow
She's Tom's older sister
She's Tom's younger sister
You are getting me wrong!
Have you already met?
I won't see him anymore
I feel your pain, buddy
Tom knows that he doesn't know
It's a little nasty
It's a fad
Tom's life was changed forever
Let's be best friends forever
Someone stole Tom's bicycle
Get off your lazy ass, Tom!
Tom can do it in 10 minutes
That's a huge organ
You'll have a wonderful time
What did you decide?
I can't tell you what to do
“I’m dying without you.”
“I’ll come to your funeral.”
Tom's dad is very strict
I keep telling you!
I didn't know this thing!
How much should I tip?
Tom's dog ate the breadcrumbs
I didn't find mine!
Tom's a likable guy
I can't speak for Tom
Who let the dogs out?
I’m too tired to run
Have you ever been to London?
Don’t laugh at them
She is Tom’s older sister
Redheads drive me crazy!
You doubt my loyalty?
Our summer is short, but warm
Everything really sucks!
I wear a suit, but not a tie
What is your line of work?
We’ll continue after the film
Would you like some cake?
Oh, and the Big Dipper, too
That's toilet humor
What a question..
Well, um..
An orangutan, I guess.
You are evil!
You are all demons!
I won't tell anyone
I've kept a blog before
Tom didn't go far enough
Tom, may I have some money?
Tom became editor-in-chief
Look at the time!
I'm gonna be late for school!
Bye!
Be careful.
How careless can you get?
Is there a trick to it?
It's red, isn't it?
I don't like big cities
You love your mother, right?
You love your father, right?
You love your wife, right?
They won't eat meat
I'm desperate
I'm free anytime
Today is October 11th
This is none of my business!
The point is it's not funny
You've done better than that
I don't know his whereabouts
But how difficult that was!
Was I about to die?
Isn't it enough?
Be prepared!
Aren't there any risks?
It's all a matter of semantics
Yes, but she just left
Yes, but she left just now
Everybody's a winner
Tom says he doesn't like money
He got done for match-fixing
Whose is this food?
He's still underage
That guy's a friend of mine
He's a science fiction fanatic
Do you speak Dutch?
The bread's on the table
Where's the bread?
I'm allergic to dust
I'll show you some
This isn't the time
I'm studying Toki Pona
I'm learning Toki Pona
I'm tired, that's all
This is more important!
It's very easy
It's very difficult
Our team won 3 to 1
Let's go out tonight?
You got a smoke?
The game was a tie, 2-2
I don't like the look of it
Tom's father disowned him
Tom doesn't have a credit card
Tom drives a black car, right?
Damned, you look good!
Tom is Mary's protege
It's a fucking mess
Tom won't interfere
It's not as bad as it seems
Where were the police?
Where was the police?
Do they know about us?
Tom can't get enough of it
Did he stay very long?
What do we do next?
Mary can't get enough of it
Why didn't she come?
You're never at home
You're leaving already?
You're our guest for the week
He's ahead in the race
Our team lost, 2-0
Have you been to Cairo?
This music is from the 40s
My computer's acting up
What a superficial answer!
You think I'm an idiot?
Don't go without a hat
This one's shot
What's the text about?
I didn't buy them
Whose son are you?
Don't drive so fast
We're all going to die!
Tom can't help it
Goodbye, see you very soon!
Do you speak Toki Pona?
He didn't like school
Is there a telephone nearby?
Do you know his father?
That really wasn't easy!
Tom was elected in 2010
It's an interesting argument
It's a relief
What happens next?
We can't compete with that
It's a whole other ball game
What is art?
It's only getting bigger
Don't act like that
It wasn't easy to convince her
Can I sit next to you?
I can't stay here
Tom won't last long
Liar!
No hard feelings!
No offence!
No offense!
I've got a sweet tooth
It's pissing with rain
It's bucketing down
We haven't seen you in a while
Christ is risen!
She didn't intend to hurt you
I didn't mean to confuse him
Who did that?
Did I scare you?
We didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry if I scared you
Don't listen to him!
What do you want?
Forget about it.
Don't mind her
Don't pay attention to her
Who the fuck cares?
Tom's palms were sweaty
It's a risky proposition
Did anyone ask for me?
Who wrote the Bible?
Tom has a fast 56k modem
God bless you.
I'm an atheist.
Act like a man!
Is it necessary to have a god?
Eat your soup, John!
Tom's radio is broken
That's so weird
Don't speak to her like that
What an idiotic mistake!
Don't make me lose my patience
I'll pay for lunch
She's a bit of a slapper
It's cloudy today
How much time do we have?
Maybe you can't hear me?
Don't try me
How long will it last?
There's nothing to do
I am 24 years old
Where are you going to move?
When are you going to move?
I don't like being waited for
What was his name?
Do you live in this area?
Who ended up paying the bill?
Who is this pretty girl?
Do you still need money?
We'll destroy the old farms
I hope we'll find lots of it
Have a break!
We're on speaking terms
Tom was strip-searched
I'd like to leave feedback
Do you play tennis well?
I didn't notice this thing
You don't like it?
We need your help!
Tom had a feeling of déjà vu
Is this where you live?
I'm horny
Don't let yourself be fooled!
How is this possible?
It's wrong
How did this happen?
This food is gluten-free
You won't make it!
Can I sit here?
It's easy for you
That's it
I'm outta here
He's gaining time
Tom didn't know their names
I'm here to vote
I don't recognize anyone
There's nowt as queer as folk
Is it really possible?
Tom can't afford it
Amazing, isn't it?
It's boring to watch
We'll do it live
Didn't you see the man?
Do you get it?
What's all the hubbub about?
He retired at 60 years of age
Your tears tear my heart!
My brother bothers me!
Do you cry often?
I'm too happy!
The night goes on!
Can you speak Mandarin?
What are we having for dinner?
What's for supper?
Mr So-and-So is dead
They didn't listen
How old is the Eiffel Tower?
It reminds me of something!
I can't see anything!
I don't see anything!
I don't understand either
Do you want me to answer?
It will be a wonderful day!
Are you Swedish?
No, Swiss.
Why didn't you inform me?
Why didn't you let me know?
Is this good English?
You're too young to love
Tom's bruises are gone
Now you're going too far
It's made of leather
You've just been told
I'm tracking a buck
Do you need our help?
Did you catch what he said?
You're a nobody
You're a fuck-up
I've heard everything
I can't do anything else
I'm sorry
Now I'll take you by the hand
Tim writes left-handed
The building has 20 floors
What about us?
Tom is wearing a wolf t-shirt
There's no minimum wage here
I can't speak Vietnamese
Could you please speak slower?
I didn't hear you clearly
Would you please say it again?
My God!
I left the wallet in my room!
Do I look like a terrorist?
Shut the hell up!
What did you just say?
Is the chicken local?
It's a travesty
It's really embarrassing
I'm by your side
Do you think I'm getting fat?
Don't worry
Did you eat breakfast?
Have you finished dinner?
I don't think that he's honest
What are the men doing?
I'll thank you to leave now
Cash or credit card?
She's not the lying type
What a strange guy!
Have you already had lunch?
You two are brothers, right?
Would you stop that, please?
Why would anybody kidnap Tom?
What's Tom wearing?
What's Tom reading?
What's Tom listening to?
What's Tom doing?
Tom's dog was barking at Mary
Tom isn't here
He's already left
Let's not just sit around
Let's go out and do something
Let's go see Tom
It won't happen again
I've got a lot of work to do
I'm very proud of you
I'm still a little hungry
I'm still a little dizzy
I'm sorry
I'm not bluffing
I'm feeling kind of sleepy
I'm feeling kind of dizzy
Don't forget your umbrella
Don't forget your jacket
Don't forget to call Tom
Do you work here?
Did you invite Tom to dinner?
Can you stand up?
Are you feeling any better?
Waiter, I need a knife
I don't want to lie any more
It's ok now?
Noo!" cried Tom
I don't believe any of it
What's wrong sweetie?
How old is your daughter?
I didn't know you were back
Tom's computer is broken
Oh My God!
I left the wallet in my room!
What caused the explosion?
I aced the exam!
If I want something, I get it
I'll come work for you
What a pessimism!
This doesn't serve any purpose
Everybody's happy
Been there, done that
How convenient!
We can't see anything
I'm terrible at languages
I don't speak Lojban
It's a matter of pride
You can't drink the water here
We're not in the 80s anymore
Can you let it out?
Is dry food good for cats?
I'd like to be self-employed
I'd like to be a freelance
I work like a slave!
What happened or is happening?
Age before beauty!
Hang on a while!
Never hurt someone's feelings
It's old and clunky
It's a two-edged sword
It's a double-edged sword
No time-wasters
This backpack is blue-ish
It's what Tom would want
I won't give up on Tom!
Not for the faint-hearted!
How do I get to NHK?
He won't like this
She won't like this
I'm quite tired
It's time to show your cards
I don't want to study German
So you lost all your money?
That'll teach you to gamble
He'll soon be about again
Is it ok if I help you?
There's a lot of flu about
What is he angry about?
I'm staying home
You kill me!
That's all I wanted to know
A girl can dream, right?
A boy can dream, right?
I'm having the same problems
It's the size of a small car
It's just not fair
I'm very tired today
Today, I am very tired
We're not getting any younger
Where's mommy?
It's time to fess up
Modern dances?
It's time to come clean
O time, suspend your flight!
I mistook her for Ann's sister
I'm waiting for my girlfriend
I'm waiting for my boyfriend
I've decided not to appeal
That's fucking cool
We're not going to make it
We're not gonna make it
He's the captain of a team
Why didn't it work?
Mary is a naïve young actress
I'm a little confused
Tom has a 9-5 office job
We can't let this continue
Saule, give me the drum
Saule, give the drum
Hello, old friend!
Those cunning bastards!
Tom vowed he'd never do it
What is Tom doing here?
Everyone's a winner
I'm eating rice now
It's part of life
Life isn't easy
Tom thinks he's invincible
Tom's father is an alcoholic
I've never played crazy golf
It's not quite ready yet
What's new with you?
Do you have any news?
Will you eat dinner?
I don't eat meat
Where is the nearest store?
What languages do you know?
No, I am not married
I'm better
What would you say to her?
What makes us human?
He'll come around to the idea
My ass!
Want fries with that?
Let's make love!
Make love, not war!
Where's the "any" key?
Tom uses Windows 7
Don't sweat it
And why would I do that?
Are you going to the party?
It's a very simple process
I've got to go back and check
Did I lock the door?
When will he come?
Who is this tough guy?
Yes, I can speak a bit of it
I'm very sorry, but I can't
Stop complaining and obey!
It's the day of the Lord
Where can I wash my hands?
Oh no, not again!
That's all going to change
You're lucky
You don't have to stay
Why would someone kill Tom?
Why didn't Tom call for help?
Why did you kill Tom?
Why did you do it?
Why are you smiling?
Who owns this truck?
Where did you put the ketchup?
When did they go?
What will they do?
What was I supposed to do?
What motivates you?
What does this smell like?
What do you weigh?
What did they say?
What are your pet peeves?
What are you passionate about?
What are these?
We contacted Tom's family
Tom had money, a lot of it
This is Tom's address book
Something's going to happen
Should we wait for Tom?
Should we call Tom?
May I speak to you in private?
May I go first?
Let's go talk to Tom
Let's go back to the office
Let's go and talk to Tom
It's still here
It's my life
I've locked my keys in my car
I'm very disappointed in you
I'm not your coach anymore
I'm not sure what's wrong
I'll catch you later
I'd like you to leave now
I should've known better
I just don't fit in anymore
I just can't figure it out
I don't want to see you again
I don't want to quit this job
I don't want to miss my train
I don't want to go there again
I don't have time for this
I can't blame you
How long did Tom work here?
How long are they?
How do you handle stress?
How did you two meet?
How did you know we were here?
How did you get into my house?
Don't do that
It's not your job
Does everybody understand?
Do you own a gun?
Do you have a hunting license?
Do you have a fishing license?
Did you like it?
Did you find anything?
Can you see?
Can I make you a drink?
Are you certain about this?
Are we done?
Are there any questions?
I am not guilty!
It's a tough place to be
Are you mentally ill?
It's going really well
Tom still can't afford it
I'll believe it when I see it
Thanks for the heads-up
Which cup is yours?
I don't want to be poisoned
Man the harpoons!
Who doesn't?
Welcome to the real world!
Where did you go for vacation?
It's a rough place out there
Tomorrow it's Christmas
This is Tom's locker
The ZIP code here is 14080-000
Tom, please restrain yourself
You're a really nice man, Tom
There's something out there
It's just a bird
I'll be waiting for you
Do you get me?
I've got you
Tom, behind you!
Beer consists of 90% water
Many thanks for the meal!
I hope she's safe
My father-in-law is a lawyer
Maybe it's a trap
We've got no brakes!
Don't stare at me like that
What do you have in mind?
Snap out of it!
I've read many kinds of books
Do you really want to know?
I've already read this book
It was horrible!
Could you help?
I'm so worn out
I'm very afraid of snakes
Do you have any siblings?
A glass of red wine, please
Yes, it's just this
It's not raining
It's not that easy, huh?
Look at that red-roofed house
Hello everyone, I'm Mike
Why are you studying?
Do you have nothing to say?
It's boiling hot
I'm happy to be here
Unfortunately, Nancy was right
He's an Italian teacher
She can't ski
I'll call back soon
May I borrow your phone?
Come home early, Guillaume.
Yes, mother.
You're not the only one!
What should I do?
I burned the pot!
Let's play tennis!
Was it a dream?
Pizza, please
Even I don't understand
It's not that bad
It's a little dated
We're in trouble
Why do camels hate horses?
She doesn't like him
Who is on the train?
When did the show finish?
You just wouldn't understand
I think, therefore I follow
How annoying!
François has a good idea
Phew!
That was close!
Don't patronize me
Don't patronise me
It doesn't go far enough
Where's my phone book?
Are there bigger carrots?
You must take the medicine!
Please!
Don't open the window
Please!
Please don't skip class
I defenestrate you!
He gets up at 7
You logged on ?
How true it is!
Are you coming back tomorrow?
Do you want to talk about it?
What's the price of this?
That costs 13
Where should I pay?
She's up the duff
You're one to talk!
I'm trying to work out here
Do you want to spot me?
What do you want?
Has Tanaka already returned?
Was that not clear?
I don't speak Kazakh
It's not sure it will happen
Listen, my son!
Let's stop this argument
Don't you laugh at me!
I've gotta go to the bathroom
Do you have any grandchildren?
I won't see you today
I'll see you tomorrow, though
I won't see you today
I'll see you tomorrow, however
When I'm with you, I'm happy
I don't play pool
The sea isn't clear
He is very good-looking
Is the food halal?
I can't top up my phone

That's what I've always said
Did you receive my letters?
I can beat him!
I don't want to become blind!
Do you want to play?
I'm not guilty
I'm innocent
Has anybody seen my beer mug?
Of course not!
Look at the woman over there!
That was very easy!
Nobody noticed my absence?
We need rules!
I'm fine, thanks
What do you do here so early?
Is there a bank nearby here?
Do you have a package tour?
I'II look for it right now
It's in terminal 1
Which seat do you want please?
What about the other one?
Oh!
How bad!
Where is my seat please?
Can you clean the mess up?
He should be around 40
He must be around 40
Can I eat?
Did you like your first class?
Can't you live your own life?
I'm happy you're here
I'm happy because you're here
I'll go to my bed and cry
I'll never find true love
I'll tell you what I did today
My 7th graders are annoying
It isn't worth it!
Get it right!
I like to be organised!
You’re getting into deep water
Don't open those windows
Who took the picture?
It's too cold
I'm in love with this woman
Without you, I am nothing
Now, it's up to you
I've done my part
Is that a country or a city?
You better not do that!
I don't speak Turkish
Fear me, if you dare!
Now, listen
I'm sure I will find a way
Can you open the door for me?
I'm tired of writing
I don't need anyone
Do they remember me?
I don't know where to start
I'm confused now
Maybe it's too late
Perhaps it's too late
Tom doesn't own a credit card
Gravity wins again!
He's a famous Japanese popstar
Probate lawyers to the rescue!
They don't pay me attention
I don't like to watch tv
I don't sleep so much
Who do you like the most?
I'm not sure
It's hard
Who do you love?
That doesn't make sense
It's the logical thing to do
Let's get this over with
There's no way to tell
I don't speak Ukrainian
Have you received the letter?
Let's listen to this cassette
Hello, is anybody there?
Be quiet, he might hear us
I don't like winter
I don't remember her name
Where is my name written?
Do they want to go anywhere?
Did you hear something?
Let's try to do something
He's a very healthy person
He doesn't look very healthy
They'd like to be healthy
I'd like to see my parents
I don't like fried food
She didn't like that place
Do you see me?
Do you want to go with me?
Where could I see you?
He's not looking at the book
Don't stand next to the window
We're hurrying to the hospital
She's never in a hurry
Why can't you hurry?
Who ate all of our food?
She's running from home
She's very pretty
If you want to run, then run
Cats can't learn to speak
How can she speak that fast?
I don't see the appeal
What a blunder!
It's very easy to use
Do you enjoy living like this?
He is my go-to guy
Do you have vaginal discharge?
That's why I've come later.

She's a new Muslim
Are you sincere to God?
Do you defend Islam?
He's your brother in Islam
You're going to hell
That's why I'm here
It's mentioned in the Quran
Who converted you to Islam?
Haven't you read the Quran?
A bottle of red wine, please
Let's drink some water
Can I look at your dictionary?
I'll go to the toilet
Thanks for your well-wishes
Everything's working fine
The bus stop isn't far from us
Why did he live in America?
That's just my imagination
He's a Muslim now
What else can this do?
He came on the 18th of April
Are you done talking?
I'm totally not a scholar
I don't know, go to sleep!
It's time for prayer
He's got to go pray
He didn't see her praying
Why haven't we done anything?
That's not ready!
Didn't you read the Quran?
Why don't we do anything?
Why aren't we doing anything?
He's ready to take his shahada
You're making the right move.
He's the only Muslim there
What did the imam say?

I'm not really busy
I'm not busy either
I'm not at all busy
How's your day been?
How's it going, Tom?
How is that helpful?
How is it different?
How do they do that?
How did you survive?
How did Tom survive?
How did Tom do that?
How can you be sure?
Honey, are you hurt?
Honey, are you here?
Have you decoded it?
Have you been there?
Have they done that?
Has it been damaged?
Give it a shot, Tom
Give it a rest, Tom
Get on with it, Tom
Drink your tea, Tom
Does Tom have a key?
Do you need my help?
Do you have to stay?
Do you have the key?
Do you have a point?
Do you have a house?
Do we have a chance?
Did you have dreams?
Did you have a date?
Did you have a band?
Did you buy one yet?
Could it be a virus?
Can you pick up Tom?
Can you do anything?
Aren't you done yet?
Aren't you a doctor?
Aren't you a banker?
Are you two friends?
Are you the sheriff?
Are you really busy?
Are you on the list?
Are you hustling me?
Are you being funny?
Are those your kids?
Are these your keys?
Your car's on fire
You're so stubborn
You're early again
Would they do that?
Why were you angry?
Why were they here?
Why was Tom killed?
Why was Tom crying?
Why is Tom so busy?
Why do you do this?
Why do you do that?
Why did they do it?

What's in this box?
What's in the sack?
What's in the file?
What're you asking?
What're we missing?
What'll it be, Tom?
What were you told?
What were we doing?
What was Tom doing?
What was that like?

What does this say?
What do you charge?
What do you advise?
What do they think?
What did you order?
What did Tom order?
What did that mean?
What are you worth?
What are those for?
Were you a soldier?
Were they with you?
We're not dead yet
We need Tom's help
Was that your plan?
Was that your idea?
Was that necessary?
Was it an accident?
Tom wouldn't do it
Tom won't hurt you
Tom won't help you
Tom won't get away
Tom won't eat meat
Tom won't catch me
Tom won't back off
Tom says he's busy

Tom didn't see you
Tom couldn't do it
Tom can't stand up
Tom can't stand it
Tom can't find one
Tom called me, too
Time's on our side
This isn't my book
They've had a talk
They're not so bad
They're not hungry
Then what happened?
The coffee's on me
The barn's on fire
That's Tom's horse
That's not our job
That's not my call
That's not a crime
That'll have to do
That wasn't my job
Take us there, Tom
Should you be here?
See you later, Tom
Read it to me, Tom
Now's not the time
Move it along, Tom
Maybe they're busy
Make it brief, Tom
Luckily, it worked
Look at me, please
Let's meet at 2:30
Knock it off, guys
Keep it down, guys
It's not that hard
It's not that deep
It's not our fault
It's not my choice
It's not a problem
It's not a mistake
It's not a disease
It's in your truck
It's in your hands
It's in the garage
It's in the fridge
It's in the closet
Isn't Tom with you?
Is Tom your nephew?
Is Tom still alive?
Is Tom a scientist?

I'm sort of hungry
I'm perfectly fine
I'm extremely busy
I'll leave tonight
I can't forget Tom
How old's your son?
How long's it been?
How is your sister?
How is your father?

How are you coming?
Here's my passport
Here, have a taste
Here, have a drink
Have fun, you guys
Hang in there, Tom
Get your coat, Tom
Everybody's hungry
Drink with me, Tom
Does Tom have kids?
Do you have it yet?
Do you have enough?
Do you have doubts?
Do you have a card?
Do you have a band?
Did you have plans?
Could Tom be wrong?
Can you do it, Tom?
Can we have it now?
Can it be repaired?
Are you two hungry?
Are you still busy?
Are you ready, Tom?
Are you mocking me?
Are you in on this?
Are you badly hurt?
Are you a prisoner?
You're so shallow
You're so helpful
You're dead wrong
You could've gone
You could've died
Would you do that?
Would Tom do that?
Why were you here?
Why isn't it here?
Why isn't it good?

What did Tom need?
What did Tom mean?
We're really busy
We're not so sure
We're all related
We weren't hungry
We weren't amused
We agreed on 2:30
Was Tom with them?
Was Tom with Mary?
Walk with me, Tom
Try it again, Tom
Tom won't do that
Tom won't come in
Tom won't be back
Tom wasn't hungry

Tom can't bear it
Tom can't be here
Tom can swim, too
Time's on my side
This isn't my car
This isn't for me
This isn't a trap
This is Tom's car
They weren't busy
That's not my car
That's it for now
That'll be my job
Take my hand, Tom
Take it easy, Tom
Take it away, Tom
Stay with us, Tom
Stay with me, Tom
See you later, OK?
Pray with me, Tom
Listen to me, Tom
Let us in, please
Knock it off, Tom
Keep it down, Tom
It's time to quit
It's on your desk
It's not done yet
It's not a weapon
It's my call, Tom
It's in my pocket
It's been decided
It's been cleaned
It wasn't serious
It wasn't on sale
It isn't that bad
Is Tom on his way?
Is Tom in surgery?
Is Tom in on this?
Is Tom a criminal?
Is this your desk?
Is this the place?
Is this a problem?
Is this a mistake?
Is that the truth?
Is that not clear?
Is that my coffee?
Is it that urgent?
Is it an illusion?
Is everybody busy?
I'm very busy now
I'm terribly busy
I'm slightly busy
I'm really lonely
I'm not very busy
I'm glad to do it
I'm fairly hungry
I'll feed the dog
I wasn't too busy
I need Tom's help
I can't do it now
I bet you're busy
How was your week?

How is that funny?
How does Tom know?
How did Tom do it?
How did they know?
Honey, are you OK?
Hey, this is nice

Everyone's hungry
Do your best, Tom
Do you need to go?
Do you have to go?
Do you have proof?
Do you have a son?
Do you have a sec?
Do you have a job?
Do you have a gun?
Do you have a cat?
Do you drink, Tom?
Do you agree, Tom?
Do they have that?
Did you record it?
Did you pick this?
Did Tom seem busy?
Did Tom look busy?
Could you do that?
Could it be alive?
Check it out, Tom
Can't you do that?
Aren't you a chef?
Are you sure, Tom?
Are you saying no?
Are you our enemy?
Are you my doctor?
Are you in danger?
Are you hurt, Tom?
Are you done, Tom?
Are you busy here?
Are they Canadian?
You're very cute

We weren't ready
We need you, Tom
Was Tom in on it?
Was Tom in class?
Was Tom a sailor?
Was that a guess?
Was it a robbery?
Wait for us, Tom
Turn it off, Tom
Tom's not hungry
Tom isn't so bad
Tom isn't my son
Tom isn't in yet
Tom isn't in bed
Tom gave me $300
Tom died in 2003
Tom can't get up
They're not busy
Take it easy, OK?
Spit it out, Tom
Speak to us, Tom
Speak to me, Tom
Put it down, Tom
Pray for me, Tom
Listen to me, OK?
Let it rest, Tom
It's not from me
It's not for you
It's not a trick
It's not a dream
It's not a crime
It's not a bribe
It's my decision
It's foggy today
It's a bad habit
It wasn't a race
Isn't that a lot?
Is Tom in danger?
Is Tom in charge?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom in a coma?
Is Tom at school?
Is this your son?
Is this for real?
Is that you, Tom?

I'm sort of busy
I'm quite hungry
I'm not so tired
I'm busy tonight
I'm already busy
How was your nap?
How was it today?
How do we decide?
How do they look?
How do they know?
How do they feel?
How did Tom know?

Has Tom been fed?
Go to sleep, Tom
Go on ahead, Tom
Get to work, Tom
Everybody's busy
Does Tom have it?
Do you want some?
Do you have them?
Do you have a TV?
Do it again, Tom
Did they have it?
Could it be true?
Clean it up, Tom
Can this be true?
Can this be done?
Bring it on, Tom
Bring it in, Tom
Are you two busy?
Are you on drugs?
Are you on board?
Are you my enemy?
Are you in place?
Are you homesick?
Are you done yet?
Are you a priest?
Are you a parent?
Are you a golfer?
Are they in love?
You're so weird
Why is it there?
Why is it empty?
Who is your dad?
Who do you want?
Who do you mean?
Who do you like?
Where's my room?
Where's my coat?
Where is it now?
What's with Tom?
What was it for?
What is it, Tom?
What do we want?
What do we know?
What do we have?
What do they do?
What did we get?
Were they lying?
We weren't busy
Was this for me?
Was that a joke?
Was it you, Tom?
Tom wasn't busy
Tom isn't smart
Tom isn't right
Tom isn't fazed
Tom isn't a cop
Tom can't go on
Tom can't go in
Tom can't do it
That wasn't fun
Talk to us, Tom
Talk to me, Tom
See you at 2:30
Nobody's hungry
Keep it up, Tom
Just do it, Tom
It's on my desk
It's not my job
It's not my car
It's not a loan
It's not a gift
It's not a game
It's not a fake
It's not a bomb
Is Tom your kid?
Is Tom for real?
Is Tom an actor?
Is this a trick?
Is this a drill?
Is that my robe?
Is it that late?
Is it that hard?
I'm very sleepy
I'm very lonely
I'm fairly busy
I'm always busy
How was it done?
How do we do it?
How do we begin?
How did Tom act?
How did it work?
Good night, Tom
Go to work, Tom
Give it up, Tom
Everyone's busy
Did you do that?
Did they suffer?
Cut it out, Tom
Could you do it?
Come on, you two
Come on up, Tom
Come on in, Tom
Can you do this?
Can you be sure?
Can Tom do that?
Can it be fixed?
Aren't you busy?
Are you with us?
Are you with me?
Are you OK, Tom?
Are you a model?
Are we done yet?
You're so rude
You're so lazy
You're so late
You'll be busy
Will Tom be OK?
Why is it here?
Why is it dark?
Who's not busy?
Who has it now?
Where do we go?
What do we owe?
Were they here?
We're not busy
Way to go, Tom!
Was that a yes?
Wait, you guys
Tom's not busy
Tom won't care
Tom has a Ph.D
This isn't fun
Now do you see?
Let it go, Tom
It's your loss
It's your home
Is Tom with us?
Is Tom in pain?
Is Tom adopted?
Is that my mug?
Is that my hat?
Is that a joke?
Is that a hint?
Is it in there?
Is it a weapon?
Is it a secret?
I'm so ashamed
I'm quite busy
How is Tom now?
How is it made?
How do we look?
How did you do?
How did it end?
Go for it, Tom
Get to it, Tom
Do we have one?
Do it now, Tom
Did you say 30?
Did we have it?
Did we do well?
Come on, do it
Can we do that?
Can this be it?
Who's thirsty?
When do we go?
What's it for?
Were you busy?
We're so busy
We'll be busy
Was that a no?
Was it a joke?
Nobody's busy
My name's Tom
Is that a wig?
Is that a lot?
I'm on my own
I'm busy here
I wasn't busy
How do you do it?
How did it go?
Can you do it?
Are you a fan?
Was Tom busy?
Should we go?
It's unusual
It's for Tom
It was Tom's
Was it good?
Is Tom busy?
Was it fun?
Tom's busy
Japan's climate is temperate
How much gas do you want?
Fill 'er up.
Slow down, Tom!
Where's the fire?
The food here isn't fit to eat
Will thirty dollars be enough?
We're giving a dinner for Tom
Is it hard for you to do this?
I can't find my keys anywhere
Who's going to foot the bill?
Where did you first meet Tom?
Are you allowed to fish here?
Let's swim out to the float
Didn't you see the red flag?
It's just a matter of form
Is that law still in force?
I didn't like Tom at first
Look, the barn is on fire!
I'm looking for my gloves
Do you know it for a fact?
Are you for or against it?
Fire!
Run for your lives!
I'm very fond of olives
Is the food good there?
I can't figure Tom out
How much is rye flour?
Have you flown before?
May I have the floor?
Where's the fire?
Can you fix this?
That's really interesting
You're a moron
That's really neat
That's just what I've heard
Now, there's an idea
That's not scientific
Are you coming or what?
What terrible news!
I'm just shocked
Let's give it another shot
Yes, my child
I'd better go now
The car won't start
That's elevator music
It's a crime against nature
It's a crime against humanity
It's a war crime
Can I help you with that?
We're fighting a losing battle
He's quite the talker
Could you make the salad?
He won't bite
It's okay
I won't bite
It's okay
Can you scratch my back?
He's a real prick
Could I have a word with you?
I can't stand my sister's kids
But they're so cute!
He's a little devil
She's a bean pole
I've been around the block
Big fucking deal!
What happened before that?
What planet are you from?
I want to see!
I want to see, too!
Can I see?
Can I see, too?
I'll handle the rest
He's a bonehead
Yes, it's true!
No, it's false!
It's my lucky number
It sounds silly, but it's true
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Muller!
I'm a Martian.
Oh, welcome, Tom!
Christ!
I think it's getting better
How does it feel to be old?
You're all set?
There's your receipt
I'm short-handed
Happy birthday, Dad
Happy birthday, Mom
Happy birthday, Grandma
Happy birthday, Grandpa
Tom, come check this out
It's not gonna bite you
Hey everybody, listen up!
I'm localising the software
What is going on up there?
What is going on down there?
Is he asleep?
Don't worry about the baby
Can you do me a favour?
Are you a smoker?
Are you a cop?
Why do you ask?
How was your date last night?
I didn't wake you, did I?
That's the word for it
Read a book!
I'm not in the school
I'm here for another reason
There's a cat in the box
I'm opening a box
I sleep at ten o'clock
Don't tickle me!
Are you ticklish?
I go to work at seven o'clock
I will sleep at ten o'clock
I didn't drink the water
I didn't drink the milk
May you be happy, Ricardo
Happy birthday, my friend!
I'd like to live in Europe
I'd like to live in China
Your submission is great!
Congratulations!
Thanks, everyone
Is she coming here to relax?
Don't be a cheapskate
No, it's not that
He's a crackpot
He's a dimwit
Watch out for purse-snatchers
She's sloppy and careless
Look at your clothes!
She's always hungry
You're always hungry!
He's a wheeler-dealer
She's a successful novelist
That's right up my alley
She's drowning in debt
It's a tough act to follow
Can anyone top this?
What are all those bruises?
Join us!
I'm not interfering, huh?
I'm not bothering you?
I'm not interfering, right?
You're doing it ass backwards
Don't screw up
It's too late now
The cat's out of the bag
He's all bark and no bite
What are you going to wear?
What's more surprising?
Mom, I don't want to wear this
She's a total sweetheart
I wasn't sure what to say
I'm very fashion-conscious
He's trying to be cool
It's clear that he likes you
He's in the big leagues now
Right on!
He's a climate change denier
What about the girls?
Please don't get me wrong
He's so adorable
It's an inspirational story
It's a labor of love
We won the contest!
Do you have a dictionary?
Do you speak Maori?
Thanks, Mom
Are you good at sports?
Does Emily have a dictionary?
Does Laurie have a computer?
August 5th.
Who sees my son's rose?
Are you guys crazy?
You think it's true?
You can't have everything
Where would you put it?
I don't like to walk
Hate the sin, love the sinner
Take a chance!
You're lucky I was here
I love dogs, though
Once a fraud, always a fraud
Aren't they both charming?
Man is business difficult!
Do you know Tom?
I know of him.
That's false advertising
No effort required!
Why am I not surprised?
Here's the book
I'm looking after myself
Kill him, before he runs away!
Tom said he couldn't help Mary
No, I don't have it right now
He didn't buy it after all
I'll live in the city
You weren't disappointed
I didn't sleep well last night
That's not a secret
Do I have a knife?
Orange juice or champagne?
Who's coming to dinner?
Who's coming for supper?
Don't tell me how to drive
I don't even know what to say
There's no other explanation
When will it get better?
Mrs. Wood cooks very well
Mrs. Wood is a very good cook
What did I do with my keys?
I'm trusting you
He's very witty
How is the week going for you?
I'll be in Rio this weekend
It's raining horribly hard
You didn't get wet?
No, I'm okay.
Look!
Do something quick!
That's super cheap
My hiccups won't stop at all
I usually wake up at 6
It's not fair
You never make time for me!
He's using you
I'm in the same boat as you
It's pure evil
I’m fancying an American firm
I don't trust women
Which school is the best?
I changed the baby's nappy
He's a well-known person
What's his job?
Do you have smaller sizes?
Cats don't eat mice these days
What browser are you using?
You'd better see a doctor
Anyway, somehow you succeeded
There's no gain without pain
Is it okay if I go for a walk?
What shall I cook for dinner?
Don't drink too much
Why is it so messy?
Er?
I'd love to give him a blast
Let's go buy some!
That's for sure
Is that a paper?
Do I look like I'm happy?
Does Tom look like he's happy?
Do I look like I'm busy?
Does Tom look like he's busy?
Did Tom look like he was busy?
Did Tom say he'd be busy?
100 dollars?
That's pocket change!
Sit in that chair, please
Have you ever eaten insects?
He's so dull!
He went totally apeshit!
Is that supposed to be funny?
Can we trust her?
Read it again, please
Don't play dumb
He's kicking me
Is this your family?
She's quite wealthy

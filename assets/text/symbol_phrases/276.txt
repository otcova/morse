Tom has well-defined muscles
Why don't we play a game?
Is your hair color natural?
Were you checking me out?
Want to grab a cup of coffee?
He didn't have to ask me twice
Did he put the moves on you?
I had a great time too.
Let's do it again sometime
He heeds not – stirs not
Tom won't shut up about it
It’s chaotic
Some men don’t know that
Come on, Tom
We're leaving
I'm sorry
She's real cute
He's real cute
Don't be afraid to be yourself
I need coffee!
Is there a discount available?
I need sunshine!
Go, Tom!
She's too fast
Take Tom for example!
But that guy is irritating!
What an irritating person!
Of all things, don't do that!
Tom's brother hurt me
Tom's brother found a knife
I don't have water
I don't have the water
I should've paid attention
You should've paid attention
We should've paid attention
This story isn't believable
Listen up!
Don't be so cheeky!
Listen up!
Don't be so insolent!
It's about my mother
Where's my alliance?
Why did you do that?
What are you a student in?
Can you lend me a manga?
Can you lend me a comic book?
You think I didn't notice?
It's my favorite sandwich
It's my favourite sandwich
Are you making a face?
Don't start over, please
It's true that it's cold
It's true that it's hot
Don't be stubborn like that
I'm a little achy
I'm going to read some books
I won't say that
Death isn't death, my friends!
It's change!
Who hid my suspenders?
I can't find my suspenders
Have you seen my suspenders?
Where are my suspenders?
Please don't get angry!
I'll stop immediately
Please don't get worked up!
Don't eat garbage
I don't like him very much
Are you drunk yet?
Are these really yours?
Are you a morning person?
How many people are here?
Do you work out regularly?
How do you relax after work?
How often do you play sports?
What do you regret not doing?
Are you close to your parents?
Are you usually early or late?
How do you relax after school?
What do you really love to do?
Tom hasn't had an easy life
You don't need to shout
Is there anything in this box?
Tom's lung collapsed
Do you also want to eat?
He doesn't have friends at all
I can't stand coffee
We don't know anyone here
Do you like my car?
Tom's cat is dead
Who could it belong to?
It's going to rain this night
Look, Tom!
Just say you're sorry
The show's about to start
Hey, that's mean!
Tom is Mary's private tutor
I don't know why I'm crying
I'll see you after school
Does the supernatural exist?
Do you think aliens exist?
Do you read a lot of books?
Do you read lots of books?
How did the two of you meet?
Tom talked to Mary, too
They're both from Boston
We both have driver's licenses
Tom said he didn't know you
Is all this money yours?
Is all of this money yours?
Who are those women?
I don't need any more
I don't want that one
I don't want this one
Tom doesn't know you
Is there any beer left?
All of these are Tom's
Both of these are Tom's
Are you all by yourself?
Half of these are Tom's
Can I have one of these?
Many of these are Tom's
Most of these are Tom's
None of these are Tom's
Would you like any more?
Some of these are Tom's
Can I have some of these?
Do we have any more beer?
A few of these are Tom's
A lot of these are Tom's
Who did you buy this for?
Three of these are Tom's
Tom knows Mary's address
I shave for my wife's sake
Don't ask why, just do it
When will he return home?
Apply yourself, Tom
This is Tom's turf
Tom told me that isn't true
Tom told me it wasn't true
Tom thinks he'll die soon
Tom thinks that he'll die soon
That's not the way I do that
I'm sorry you won't be there
This car's mine
Which ones do you like best?
Who did you see in the park?
Are all of these books yours?
Those shoes are Tom's
I don't want any more coffee
What languages can you speak?
Who does this land belong to?
Do you have any more of these?
I'll try to do that by myself
What university did you go to?
Tom should've called me
Which ones do you like better?
Tom should've called us
I don't really agree with that
Tom wasn't there either
Neither of these is Tom's
Tom should've hugged Mary
Tom shouldn't lie to Mary
These sunglasses are Tom's
Tom doesn't like spaghetti
Tom should've come with me
Tom shouldn't buy that car
Tom accepted Mary's apology
All three of these are Tom's
Tom has stopped smoking, too
Tom should've gone with Mary
Tom should've listened to me
Tom should've listened to us
Tom should've told me sooner
Tom shouldn't listen to Mary
Tom's birthday is in October
Tom should've left Mary alone
Tom wasn't so sure of himself
What Tom says isn't important
You don't get what I'm saying
Is it snowing?
Tom should've told Mary sooner
Let us work!
May God help us!
Don't underestimate us!
Where's the money I gave you?
I'd say she is over forty
Let's cook dinner together
Can you make a salad?
I'll walk home
Don't be ridiculous
Are you crying too?
I'll walk home from here
I'll walk home from here.
Are you sure?
I'll walk home with you
Are you free for lunch today?
Mary is flat-out gorgeous
You're the one who started it
So, who's the lucky guy?
So, who's the lucky girl?
When you have time, read this
Tom owes me $300
Tom already owes me $300
I've visited Boston as well
I've also visited Boston
I'll probably never do that
I think that you're mistaken
I don't know what to do yet
I've assented to the proposal
Sami hasn't been drinking wine
Sami's wife isn't pregnant
Sami likes Layla's rants
Sami met Layla in 1996
Sami's job paid really well
He's the face of the company
Sami's manager was a woman
Sami didn't do that task
Sami didn't come to work
Sami was with his co-workers
Arms – bring me arms!
It's likely Tom will do that
Why's Tom here?
It's possible Tom will do that
Tom won't be home until Monday
Tom won't be home till Monday
I couldn't stay awake
Come here, please
I'm glad we're done
I'm not a journalist
I've almost finished
Don't throw this away
Let's go out for lunch
Do you play chess often?
I'm doing that tomorrow
Does Tom play golf often?
You're walking too fast
Tom isn't a teenager yet
Can you get here by 2:30?
I'd go anywhere with you
I've arranged to do that
I hope to be home by 2:30
I've regretted doing that
I wouldn't change anything
I've made plans to do that
I don't much like that idea
Tom probably won't be there
I don't yet know the answer
I expect to be home by 2:30
Has Tom been doing that long?
I most likely won't do that
I'll try to be home by 2:30
I'll try to get there early
We'll just have to trust Tom
Why don't you try it my way?
Maybe Tom won't be here today
Come here a minute, will you?
I certainly wouldn't do that
I don't have that much money
Tom didn't even try to help us
I wasn't wearing my seatbelt
Tom didn't pay for that, I did
I'm not concerned about that
I'm not looking for sympathy
My headlights aren't working
Will you be home before dark?
I don't see prices going down
Please try to be here by 2:30
I really don't do that anymore
I'm not allowed to do anything
I'm not any good at doing this
I'm getting sleepy
I should have said 2:30
What should have happened?
Who should have done that?
That's what I should have done
That's what I should have said
I'm sorry
It can't be helped now
You didn't have to come here
Tom didn't have to shout
Tom didn't need to come here
Tom didn't have to come here
Tom didn't have to take a taxi
I would've understood
Who else could have done this?
Who else could have done that?
Who could have predicted this?
I'd have gone if I could have
Who else could have done it?
What could have caused this?
Who could have foreseen it?
Who could have done this?
Who could have done that?
What could have happened?
I'm glad you didn't tell Tom
You could've told me
Without you, I would have died
I'm sure Tom would have agreed
Who would have predicted this?
Who else would have done that?
That's what I would have done
Who else would have done it?
That would have worked, too
Who would have thought it?
Who would have done this?
Who would have done that?
Who would have cared?
If you don't know it, ask me
It can't be cured
Help!
I can't swim
How long were you together?
Don't ask me to explain
Tom won't believe I did that
I'm certain you can do that
I'm sure I'll pass the exam
I'm sure you'll be satisfied
I'm so tired I can hardly walk
I'm positive Tom has finished
I'm positive Tom has done that
I'm afraid you'll get lost
I'm afraid I'll make a mistake
I'm happy you're my friend
I'm relieved you're safe
I'm relieved that you're safe
I'm used to working hard
I'm accustomed to working hard
I'm accustomed to living alone
I'm used to cold weather
I'm accustomed to cold weather
I'm sure that Tom will succeed
I'm positive Tom is wrong
I'm positive that Tom is wrong
I'm positive you're wrong
I'm positive that you're wrong
I'm convinced that I'm right
I'm used to the climate here
I'm afraid that it'll rain
I'm not good at mathematics
I'm yours and you're mine
I'm aware this is Monday
I'm aware that this is Monday
I'm not used to hard work
I'm hers and she's mine
I'm as surprised as you
I'm not a child any longer
I'm no longer a child
I'm as rich as Tom
I'm as rich as Tom is
I'm 30 years old now
I'm thirty years old now
I'm as tired as you are
I'm as tired as you
I'm thirsty
I'm lost
Can you help me, please?
I'm very sorry for what I said
I'm very interested in fishing
I'm thinking about that matter
I'm thinking about my children
I'm sorry to have troubled you

I'm just a humble teacher
I'm invited to this party
I'm in no mood for joking
I'm glad to hear the news
I'm completely against it
I'm buying a new umbrella
I'm ashamed of my conduct
I'm an optimist by nature
I'm using a new computer
I'm trying my level best

I'm playing video games
I'm playing in the park

I'm not romantic at all
I'm just warming up now
I'm having a look at it
I'm glad to be with you
I'm giving you an order
I'm close to the bridge
I'm changing my clothes

I'm like you
I'm a widow
I'm taller
I'm sweaty
Tom won't hear anyone
Tom won't hear anybody
I'm glad that I came
I'm glad that I did that
As it is, I can't pay you
It's private
There's nothing God can't do
Words can't convey my feelings
Mary's parents can't stand Tom
Life can't exist without water
I can't agree to your proposal
You can't heal a broken heart
Without water, we can't exist
We can't do the work in a day
Owls can't see in the daytime
Man can't live by bread alone
I can't do the work on my own
We can't exist without water
I can't describe my feelings
We can't play baseball here
We can't go into the studio
We can't exist without food
My mother can't drive a car
I can't quite understand it
I can't accept your present
You can't be a blood donor
We can't meet your demands
My father can't lift it up
Man can't live without air
We can't live without air
I can't stop the bleeding
I can't stand you anymore
I can't possibly help you
I can't follow your logic
I can't approve your plan
You can't buy that judge
This story can't be true
The report can't be true
I can't think about that
I can't fix the computer
I can't afford a holiday
The story can't be true
Our baby can't talk yet
Money can't buy freedom
I can't lift this stone
I can't afford the time
Man can't live forever
I can't possibly do it
I can't come next week
You can't tame a wolf
Time can't be stopped
I can't possibly come
I can't lift this box
A wolf can't be tamed
It can't last long
I can't pray now
We can't go in
I'm in Boston today
I'm sick and tired of Tom
I'm free all day today
Tom won't let me see Mary
I'm not a student here
Tom didn't let me see Mary
I'll be leaving at 2:30
Tom had a knife, didn't he?
I've been dyeing my hair
Do you have to go so soon?
Tom won't go to work today
I'll be there to help you
I'm thinking of resigning
I have to be there by 2:30
I wish I hadn't left early
Tom's mother has remarried
I'm calling from Australia
I'm pleased with Tom's work
I'm dying to see you again
Tom won't let Mary go there
I'm going to leave at 2:30
Where do you want me to go?
I'm being forced to do this
Tom didn't tell Mary, did he?
Where do you want me to sit?
Tom doesn't want it, does he?
I'm quite willing to do that
Tom won't find anything here
I've got to be there by 2:30
Tom wouldn't wash the dishes
I've learned a little French
Tom's favorite food is pasta
We can't change our schedule
Tom's garden is really small
Tom's speech was interesting
I'm fed up with this nonsense
Tom won't visit Mary tomorrow
I'm going to a friend's house
Would you prefer that I leave?
I'm counting on you to do that
Tom's aunt is richer than mine
I'm not a student here anymore
We can't afford to buy a house
I can smell Mary's perfume
Tom hasn't come yet
I can't find Tom
Somebody must've left it there
I can smell Mary's perfume
She must've been here earlier
It must've been terrible
I must've forgotten it
We aren't here to arrest you
We're eating now
We're eating breakfast indoors
We're working for world peace
We're on good terms with them
We're going from bad to worse
We're flying over the Pacific
We're eating breakfast inside
We're dependent on each other
We're too busy for that, Tom
We're staying at our uncle's
We're looking for volunteers
We're listening to the radio
We're going to travel by car
We're going to the mountains
We're eating dinner outdoors
We're not going on vacation
We're not cold in the house
We're liable for the damage
We're in favor of your plan
We're going to make a video
We're going to have a storm
We're baking in the kitchen
We're in need of some food
We're going to the country
We're changing our clothes
We're awaiting your answer
We're the first to arrive
We're going to the market
We're all in grave danger
We're very far from home
We're short of time, Tom
We're on the wrong track
We're not hiring anymore
We're at school together
We're not all that safe
We're closing the store
We're building a bridge
We're all happy to help
We're husband and wife
We're having a meeting
We're glad to help you
We're expecting a baby
We're to meet at noon
We're on the way home
We're in grave danger
We're doing something
We're soccer players
We're short of money
We're coming at once
We're baking cookies
We're all equal here
We're about your age
We're truly pleased
We're finally free
We're guinea pigs
We're too drunk
We're soulmates
We're watching
We're teachers
We're so happy
We're busy men
We're crying
We're boys
We're men
We're not as safe as we think
It's not cold in the house
That's patently ridiculous
It's patently obvious
Good call, Tom
Tom's potential has no ceiling
Something doesn't seem right
Tom cuts Mary's hair
Do you like yoga?
Tom is with someone, isn't he?
Do you guys not like my couch?
Do you guys not like my sofa?
Don't complain all the time!
What a load of shit!
What's yours?
Does it have strings?
Does it make a noise?
Nancy, this letter is for you
I don't think he was so timid
We can't tell Tom what he did
I wasn't right
Silence!
Are you not good at math?
Are you moving?
I won't go shopping
Will I eat lunch?
How's it going, Chuck?
You write, I read
Are you free?
Can I call?
Tom finished Mary's soup
Is Tom as tall as me?
Is Tom as tall as I am?
Tom said he wasn't impressed
What Tom told you wasn't true
Does Tom have to be present?
Does Tom like his parents?
Tom is my brother's friend
Tom helped Mary, didn't he?
Tom hates this, doesn't he?
Tom is Mary's only nephew
Tom helped you, didn't he?
I'm reluctant to help Tom
Tom's plan is quite good
Tom's ideas seemed crazy
Tom's bag was very light
Tom isn't a good drummer
Tom found it, didn't he?
Tom won't forgive Mary
Is Tom at school today?
Tom's boat was stolen
Tom's answer is wrong
Tom won't leave today
What's your area of expertise?
What kind of food do you eat?
What do you need to do today?
How often do you play hockey?
What do we need to do today?
Tom won't go there
What'll you do if it rains?
Tom won't drink it
Please don't get angry
I'm just killing time
Is Tom lazy?
Let's go on the Ferris wheel!
Mom, the fridge doesn't cool
Tom isn't here yet
He must've missed the bus
I'm not against outlawing guns
Don't congratulate me!
Don't say congratulations!
Do you price match?
Tom's laptop has a touchpad
Tomorrow, maybe
Were you listening, Tom?
My daughter has disappeared!
I'm not in a good mood
Can you use this?
Guys!
Wait!
Here, look
Just like this?
Are you going to remove this?
Are you going to make a shelf?
Let's go with the standard
Do you know what I'm thinking?
OK, it's fine
What brings you here so early?
I'll wait here for Tom
I hope I don't disappoint you
I'm sure you'll both do well
I think I could've helped Tom
I'll stay until Tom leaves
I think that'll happen
Tom knows Mary, doesn't he?
I'm ready for next week
I'm beginning to feel cold
I usually don't drink coffee
I normally don't drink coffee
I'm angry about what happened
I'm thinking of becoming a nun
Do your parents like Tom?
What inspires you most?
After he ate, Tom went to bed
Where are the scissors?
I can't survive on just coffee
Or, can I?
I'll come again another time
Let him finish talking!
Let him finish speaking!
Let him finish his sentence!
I'm not any good at math
They're not allowed in here
This man isn't my husband
Tom and I've started dating
Tom isn't a student, is he?
Tom isn't a member, is he?
Tom isn't a good cook, is he?
Tom isn't a criminal, is he?
Tom isn't a cat person, is he?
She thinks I'm stupid
Tom's inside
Is the work finished?
We simply couldn't resist
The old man got misty-eyed
I'm sorry, I digress
I'm putting on the pullover
I shouldn't have
You shouldn't have
Where should I put the bike?
Tom is beautiful, isn't he?
If you don't know, ask me
Did you open my chest?
Is the restaurant expensive?
Do you see my son?
Is this Tom's bike?
Tom still isn't back
Where is he?
I got up just at 10 today
Why do you take this medicine?
To sleep.
She's in love with you
Let's stop somewhere to eat
Why didn't you ask me sooner?
Don't make eye contact!
May I introduce myself?
I'll go if you won't go
Is the sky weeping?
I'm not lazy
I'm just conserving energy
Are we doing this or not?
It's rather chilly outside
He won't be gone long
She won't be gone long
Is this the stuff Tom wants?
Tom knows Mary doesn't like it
I can't imagine that's changed
Is Tom waiting for me?
Do I have to be there?

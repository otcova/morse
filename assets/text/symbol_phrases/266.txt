How did Sami's gun get there?
Stop now, please
Tom works full-time
Where is your luggage?
It's turning sour
Hey, that's cheating!
What did you do for a living?
Spirit, are you here with us?
I'll see you down there
It sounds so stupid.
To me, it doesn't.
So where are you headed?
You'll be safe
I'll help you.
You're my hero.
We're responding to a 911 call
You can't come now
There's a lot going on
What's the gun for?
Some score to settle?
The feeling is mutual.
Oh yeah?
Then get out of my house!
It's his stag do
It's his stag party
When did you buy that phone?
Am I sick, Doctor?
How do you plan on hiding it?
You asked to see me?
Why are men like that?
This is so entertaining!
I'll never understand men
I'll never understand women
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
They don't have to stay
Tom said he wouldn't win
What if Tom did that?
Tom says he's desperate
Tom says he's very busy
Don't pull me
We couldn't put out the fire
Where is Sami rushing to?
Let's go back now
I'll clean up that myself
Can I go play with Sami?
Off you go.
It's supper time
You're having me on now
Now you're having me on
Is your throat sore again?
You're not mad at me?
We're in luck today
You can't sleep here
I'll help you clean it up
Am I walking too fast?
We're a band
Trust, but verify
We'll need it
We'll definitely need it
Tom hasn't done very much
We'll need it
We'll definitely need it
You'll need one
That's not your cup
That's my sister's camera
That's a pagoda
That's a hotel
That's a boat
That bicycle isn't Tom's
That applies to Tom, too
Why do you eat that crap?
They'll eat your bananas
Who will you be coming with?
I'm at my parents' house
I'm at my parents' place
How can I call a taxi?
Is Bitcoin a bubble?
Don't be shy, Tom
Send me a postcard!
My father's saying nothing
I will devour you, little boy
Jupiter has at least 69 moons
How about some eggs and bacon?
You drive me crazy, baby.
I know.
What does the barometer say?
We're playing soccer
Very funny, Sami.
I'm sorry for getting so mad
What's your name?
I thought you would never ask.
Why not?
What about that red dress?
It's not correct word
Looks like it’s your lucky day
What does your wife do?
What does your husband do?
Tom's skin is dry
It's not boring
It's cool
It's cool
It's cool
It's cool
Your mom and dad don't know?
Your parents don't know?
They don't need to know
Tom is a thrill-seeker
Tom's desk was perfectly clean
Tom's desk is perfectly clean
She doesn't like football
It's mine now
Are you already awake?
It's a routine procedure
She has pear-shaped breasts
Sorry, Sami, nature calls
If you found it, it is yours
That's you, isn't it?
Not this time.
You're a very good artist.
So is Sami.
Sami knows all the words.
He's an experienced comedian.
Who else wants to take a dump?
I look, but I don't see
My brother's son is my nephew
Let's go and play
It's on telly right now
Kettle's on
What do you fancy?
Do you want anything?
You've barely moved all day
You can't disappear like that
Ready?
Go!
I'm done practising
I'm your dad
I do believe you're jealous
You're jealous.
Jealous?
Of whom?
Of whom is Layla jealous?
How far did you run?
Sami's dog caught the frisbee
We haven't been alone in years
Let's have a second honeymoon
We're stuck.
What do you mean "we"?
It's just a baby crocodile
I'll go in that direction
Layla doesn't shave her legs
Idiot!
Idiot?
Is dinner ready, Mom?
Is that clever?
Very.
Take off your coat, please
It's too dark to see
It'll soon be too dark to see
Should it snow tonight?
I'm on no one's side
Tom spent the night half-awake
Do you want a glass of milk?
He's not a loser
He's my friend
Advertising again!
I promise.
Where were you?
Come on, Tom, lighten up
She's just a friend
He's just a friend
When were these trees planted?
A tree fell on Tom's house
What's your favorite tree?
What kind of tree is this?
Who planted these trees?
That's a fir tree
Where is the ice cream parlor?
It wasn't possible to go
We're going to live together
You're a rum old bird!
You're a funny one!
Try to power cycle it?
I'm standing under a tree
I'm standing under the tree
Hey, you wanna get beat up?
Don't say stupid things!
You're well in there, Tom!
I should've never trusted Tom
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Why do you like black coffee?
I like Norwegian!
Keep a sharp eye!
I'm drinking my coffee
I was raped!
Do you work on Mondays?
Do chickens pee?
I'm talking to my child
I'm old school
I'm sure they're ready
Let's go to bed now
May I go to school tomorrow?
Sami can't wait that long
Who else could it be?
Sami can't stay for dinner
Sami's cooking isn't that good
Sami has an over-inflated ego
Thank you.
You're welcome.
What's this hissing sound?
I know you're the boss.
You'd better believe it.
Maybe you're right.
Of course I am.
I may be small, but I'm quick
Sami can't go to the dance
I have a house with a pool.
Now you're making me curious.
Is this freak your friend?
Where can I find a translator?
His watch said seven o'clock
For a while, there was silence
It's a wonderful place
When does Tom usually eat?
Show him who's boss
Show her who's boss
Show them who's boss
Where is the ring?
How much did the ring cost?
It's my ring
Never doubt!
Are you going to eat with us?
She's playing football
Football's not a game of chess
I don't want to live that way
What is taking them so long?
Joy to the world!
Did I say it right?
Why is the child alone?
Where is his mother?
Why are you alone?
Where is your mother?
Tom can't keep it in his pants
Don't flirt with the customers
What seems to be the trouble?
How bad is it, doctor?
It wasn't really a date
No, Tom didn't tell me
Is that why you stopped?
You're drunk.
No, I'm not.
What did you win?
I can't believe I'm crying
Was it a good workout?
I've lived in Boston before
I'm going to the barber today
I don't know that person
I should've let Tom leave
I'm driving you home myself
How about some lunch?
Not you, Sami
You're fantastic
Who submitted Sami's name?
It's his stag night
Sami's father was murdered
Sami didn't need to ask
Sami dumped Layla's body
Sami didn't commit this crime
Sami didn't save the message
Sami was Layla's dance partner
Sami was sleep-walking
Sami won't answer that
Sami's second trial began
I've come here to study French
I've bought a cup of coffee
I've been in Boston before
I'm not a big beer drinker
I don't drink beer very often
What's this movie about?
I think you're hallucinating
I think I'm imagining things
Could you speed it up, please?
Of course you do.
I've been to Australia once
Don't talk to Tom about it
I've bought you lunch today
Don't meddle in Tom's affairs
Can you hear us OK?
Is Vera celebrating Easter?
I'm starting this evening
Are you singing today?
What wonderful flowers!
Action is needed!
Did Tom sleep well?
You're here already?
Please quickly take a bath!
I'd like a lager
I'm sorry I laughed
You don't need to apologize
Were you with him last night?
Were you with her last night?
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm telling you.
Tom can't see his own mistakes
Do you want a drink?
No, thanks.
How much did he pay you?
How much did she pay you?
Go away!
I don't want to see you
Do you think she hates me?
Do you think he hates me?
And what did he say?
I'm a big girl
She must be Tom's girlfriend
He must be Mary's boyfriend
Why doesn't Mary like me?
I don't have a way with words
Here comes Tom!
Act as if you were busy!
Did you take your medication?
He hasn't sold the house
They didn't accept the gifts
How can she stand it?
Tom's just larking about
Who are these presents for?
Are there fish in this pond?
Are you cold?
A bit.
I'm very glad that you're here
Why didn't you say it earlier?
You shouldn't give up hope
We didn't see a single game
We caught Tom red-handed
Layla wants Sami's love
I wonder what's on Tom's mind
Sami tore Layla's ego down
You could've told the truth
Oh my God, what a mess!
If you need help, let me know
Can you close the drapes?
Do you still want tea?
Sami's life was his family
Where do you want to go, then?
We kissed.
You what?
We kissed last night.
You what?!
Did you sleep well?
Why do you live here?
Why do you live here?
I don't.
She told you, didn't she?
He told you, didn't he?
I'm sorry, officer
It won't happen again
I knew you'd get into trouble
They don't need to know that
She doesn't need to know that
Just don't get caught
Are the presents wrapped?
But Christmas is tomorrow Tom!
I don't care how much it costs
I want it!
Please don't give me a ticket!
I'm dating someone else
It's nice to hear your voice
Hurry up, Tom!
We're going to be late!
Hurry up, Mary!
We're going to be late!
I can't find my lip gloss
Where the hell have you been?
I was worried sick!
There's no point in denying it
What are you talking about?
You're a little rascal!
You're a scamp!
You're a scally!
You're a scallywag!
Sami's door was locked
Sami didn't want the baby
Sami was a dirty-looking guy
Sami had sex with Farid's wife
Sami is sixty-six years old
Sami's life was taking off
Sami was at Layla's apartment
Sami stomped on Layla's head
Sami's love has turned to hate
Sami called Layla's condo
Sami is Farid's former partner
Sami's big brother has died
Sami's divorce was final
Sami wanted Layla's money
Sami wasn't a victim
Sami is a part-time actor
Have you read Milton's works?
Sami's throat was slashed
Really Already?
In general, everything is fine
Well, what can you say?
What does Mary think about it?
Well, what is there to say?
Sami's testimony is crucial
Sami shot between Layal's legs
Tom's hands were numb
There's no more firewood
Tom's teeth were chattering
Tom's lips were blue
I'll take some magazines
Could you please elaborate?
Follow your path!
Sami stole Farid's identity
Sami placed a frantic 911 call
Tom did a bang-up job
You think so?
Damn shame, that's what it is
May I kiss you goodnight?
Who's that girl with Tom?
These jackets aren't very warm
Snowball fight!
Food fight!
That could've been a lot worse
I don't want to go to Boston.
Where do you want to go, then?
I don't want to go to Boston.
Where would you rather go?
What time's your train?
Are you interested in sports?
Have the police been called?
Whose binoculars are these?
Is this enough for you?
Is it deep here?
The water's cold today
What's asphalt made of?
Why is there no hot water?
How much money did you win?
Who won today?
Which team won?
Sami's response was no
Sami's house wasn't for sale
Sami read Layla's journal
Don't slouch in your chair
Don't slouch in your seat
Don't get side tracked
Tom can't wrap presents
Do you want to die?
Have you spoken to Tom lately?
Sami's death made headlines
Sami wouldn't hurt a fly
She's on the loo
She's in the khazi
Did he see us?
Did he see us?
I don't think so.
Tom slept on the pull-out sofa
I don't see Mary that often­
Tom grabbed Mary's elbow
Tom can't do a single push-up
Sami's gang was on the move
I'm sorry
I know you're there
Hello, Tom speaking
Don't worry
Don't worry
Don't worry
Don't worry
My place or yours?
Tom brushed Mary's hair aside
Don't speak, just love me!
Keep them separate!
Glasses off!
Against the wall!
Ease up!
You're grinding the gears
Nice car!
Sweet ride!
When did you get this new car?
Gnarly!
Totally tubular!
Your skateboard rocks!
She's a valley girl
Crank up the heat!
Got any smokes?
I don't like sweets
I'm craving fresh fruit
He says he's an artist
Can you cook this?
Do you have the recipe?
I don't like being rejected
Can your cat type this up?
Do you like my new boots?
It's the bookkeeper's fault
My dog isn't feeling well
Can you buy some soap?
His father died in 1939
Cows eat grass -- no gluten!
Ouch!
That hurts!
It's ambiguous
He's prolific
Can I panic?
Is it inclusive or exclusive?
Why did I wear shorts?
I'm hypothetical
Vipers everywhere!
He's been shot
Is it safe at night there?
It was no "hunting accident
It's a minor infraction
I don't like these stereotypes
Quick, hide the beer cans!
He wouldn't stop making puns..
Contains hazelnuts", my ass!
Is this all new to you?
Did you say "soup" or "soap"?
It's digusting!
Do you want a clean fork?
Does this contain gluten?
Is this gluten free?
Sami's cellphone was ringing
Sami made a 911 phone call
Sami looked at Layla's eyes
Sami didn't wear his bracelet
Sami was suspended in mid-air
Sami is a victim, too
Sami took Layla's purse
Sami confirmed Layla's account
Sami's lights were out
Sami is a highly-paid lecturer
Sami's talk was boycotted
Sami couldn't believe his ears
Sami looked at Layla's face
Sami's chest was crushed
Sami planned his son's death
Sami's father is a sociopath
It's his wife
Don't be modest
Can I exchange this?
Do you have the receipt?
What is the degree of heft?
What smells funky?
Is this gold?
Don't undress
Where is my cap?
Can you wash my clothes?
Why are you indifferent?
What is your favorite show?
How many eggs?
We've ran out of syrup
It's not yours to say
Please don't question
Does she have to know?
When will you let me know?
She's pregnant again
Why do you disrespect me?
Where is my bag?
What is up with this?
What exactly is porridge?
Sami didn't have any enemies
What a dump!
You expect me to eat this?
Can I have some more?
I'm getting very hungry
It's too salty
Can you pass the salt?
How many stars?
I'm a baby
Can I come along?
Can you wash my jeans?
I don't have anything smaller
Will this make a difference?
I'm sorry I spoke
This won't matter in the end
What was I expecting?
So now you see!
Again with the..
Please don't talk to me
How am I expected to help?
What is her sickness?
What now?
OK, I'm coming
Can we stop for breakfast?
Someday, soon
Did you smoke it all?
Where is the remote?
You're watching too much TV
Sami lost Layla's trust
Why must you do this?
Do you want more coffee?
Whew, that was close
They're searching for the body
You're a big boy now
He's bashful
Sami is Farid's close buddy
Do you have exact change?
Do you have any granola left?
We're traveling light
What is this here?
OK, I'll explain
Where did I place that?
Where is my mind?
I wasn't expecting a show
What is this -- show and tell?
They've closed up
When did the store fail?
Can you give me answer?
Where to?
Sami's kidneys shut down
How often?
Chicken again?
I'll move the car
Hooray, I get to sleep in
I can't afford to miss it
Did you request this?
I won't apologize
Sami wouldn't quit smoking
Why did she ask?
So much confusion!
Don't park there
Or, can you?
Sabotage!
Jump up and help her!
Not you again..
In your dreams..
Suppose I told you..
Sami's decision was suicidal
She's not feeling well
Well, I'm done
Sami's house was in disarray
Sami's sister was hospitalized
Sami harbored no ill-will
Sami's hair is so beautiful
It's the end of the line
What is this doing here?
I'm not paying
I don't like the price
What's the situation here?
Don't tip it over!
Call a tow truck, please
Do you possess all these?
I've been saving these for you
I'm half Apache
Is it expensive?
Would it be too much to ask?
It's too spicy
You're a selfish bitch
Sami's hands are bound
I can't stand this much longer
Where's the payoff?
Jump up, sit down..
Don't be so brash
We'll change cars
I'm on my way to the airport
It's a cancer and it's growing
Too soon?
Hold me, I'm cold
Can we look at it tomorrow?
As the world turns..
He's lost his sight
He's gone blind
Can you come back tomorrow?
We're closing soon
Sami stole Layla's belongings
Can I borrow your hammer?
Do you have a screwdriver?
Sami stole Layla's passport
He's a crusty old man
Tongue in cheek, so to say..
Back 'er up
Almost home..
Another small plane crash?
It's trash day
Any allergies?
Did you have a reaction?
It won't hurt for long
She's resting
If I'd only known..
What could be worse?
Brace for impact!
What's my line?
Do you expect me to lie?
He's evil
This isn't my job!
It's my first day
You're wanted in the kitchen
Put your feet down!
Get off of there!
Stop your whining!
Explain yourself!
I'll be happy when I'm dead
What a trooper!
Stop them!
Defense!
Go team!
Stop 'em!
Pass the ball!
Do you get to travel often?
Can you reach?
I can't get down
When will you know?
So melodramatic!
Why so melancholy?
He's from a different time
All of this?
Open this door!
I'm not coming out
Please don't ask me!
I've had it!
She's mentally ill
What's Latin?
Where can I hide this booze?
Well, maybe we can
Can you go back?
I'm never returning
Take it outside!
You wanna go?
Come at me!
She's gone mad
She's in prison now
She's on the lam
She didn't say
Such a particular moment!
On what planet?
This is ass backwards!
What are you hiding in there?
How much does it weigh?
Excuse me, lady
Do you have any cash on you?
Do you have any scissors?
It's episodic
Quick, hide behind the tree
I'll throttle him!
Don't panic, yet
It's not a sure thing
OK, back up
You're at the top of the list
Sami checked Layla's feet
I'll be thinking of you
It's a probability
It's catchy
Nice moves!
There's no excuse for this
There's a hole in his head
You're my sunshine
What a pleasant day!
Please, no more beans
So dramatic!
It's got an edge to it
Is she athletic?
Can you spell it for me?
Does this look silly?
Can you proofread this?
Where is your paper?
Sami didn't hear any screaming
I've had too much coffee
That's so hot
Why are you missing class?
Did you hand it in?
Did you ask for amnesty?
I can't forgive you yet
He's the fountainhead
What is the source of this?
Can you listen for once?
I'll be working late
He's the same as he was
For the seventeenth time!
He's a star
I'm past that
We've heard it before
It's nothing new
How do you live with yourself?
What is your favorite band?
Do you hunt?
I don't like my body type
It's crooked
These don't line up
Can I have another?
Let's clean up
There's an issue with this
It's not what I was expecting
There's been a policy change
Is there a cure?
What can be said?
I've seen better years
I won't be asking twice
He's joined a gang
He's feeling a lot better
What are you doing bro?
Don't be so particular!
Don't box me in
Soup's on
I won't make excuses for you
There's no place for me
I've been unseated
Can you shield me from this?
How can I explain?
Staring into the emptiness..
Picking up the pieces..
Cover yourself!
What's falling from there?
Is anyone home?
I won't be home for long
I'm collecting
You've stepped in dog shit
No shoes in the house!
Get some water for the dog!
It's in pieces
There's no end in sight
Where can I find peace?
Endless!
Against my will?
Never!
Do you like banjos?
Stop taking pictures!
Here, feel this
Does it look infected?
Pickles on your sandwich?
Stop with the gluten!
When will you understand?
It's all been uncovered
To be discovered..
There's sand in the bed
Don't leave it here
Don't move too fast
You're drifting off
It's in the cellar
I'm just thinking..
Again with this?
There's no way of securing it
It's a masterwork!
Don't close me off
Where's my favorite nephew?
What swagger!
It's been defaced
It's all frayed
These are expensive!
You've been more than helpful
We'll make bank
Is it valuable information?
I'm no good
When will it be available?
I've seen the light
So many memories..
I'm scared for him
He's so pale
It's crushing me
I've given up hope
It's just so novel!
It's a wonderment!
Oh, baby!
Why is that so shocking?
Catch up!
Slow your horses!
On top of that!
I'm in a groove
It's so smooth
Far, far away
He's suicidal
What's your two cents?
You've never told me that
Can you slow down a minute?
I can't search that fast
I'm feeling crabby
Egah, it's vile!
What is this mush?
Get up, you slacker!
There's a moral to the story
I'm crazy for you
Will you be able to attend?
Where are you located?
Do you see a landmark?
How long will you be?
Sit up straight!
Don't hit me!
When will this song end?
Boring!
I'm not against it
What happened to this?
Can it get worse?
It's too humid for me
Is it closed?
Instant feedback!
When will you open?
It was insane!
I've been locked up too long
Do you know how to sail?
Can you navigate?
Apply some leverage!
I can't see the end of it
I ain't got nobody
I can't feel my extremities
It's been sliced clean off
Do I hear an echo in here?
I want a small, white dog
It's bleeding heavily
It's a set up!
He's bleeding to death
I didn't look up
Can you ask for me?
I'm feeling chipper
How did you get those scabs?
Do not eat your scabs!
You're grounded, mister
Chest out!
Cat hair everywhere!
It's so dark out there
It's a full moon tonight
Push off!
Catch the rope!
It's too slippery
Pink milk, pink milk!
I don't want to got to bed
I can't tell the difference
I've found a safe harbor
Clean up this clutter!
No questions asked..
How common is this?
Are you seeing this?
It's so cold
He's such a sweet boy
Don't strain yourself!
Don't lose consciousness!
He's been huffing
They're engaged at the moment
What are you -- a vampire?
I don't like this style
I'm seeing things
Old times!
Watch it hover!
This weekend, I promise
I can't peer into the future
He's a top performer
When evil truly dies..
I'm walking in a dream
It's in the back of my head
I won't be held accountable!
This tree is full of thorns!
Don't kill the vibe
Can I have half a pound?
Can't you just sit awhile?
You've hurt me deeply
It's retro
Should I take her?
I'm all used up
I'm lacking something
That's an old song
You've truly lost your way
It's been so long..
It wasn't my suggestion
I'll pick you up soon
I can't seem to touch it
Look at the moon!
There's not much time
Don't represent me
No, you don't have my approval
Raise your flag!
I've waited all of my life
I'm on my tiptoes!
Throw the ball!
That was close!
Did you feel a vibration?
OK, I'll allow it
Will I ever walk again?
I'm having intense vertigo
There's no remorse
Do you know how to pickle?
I've been married before
Long suffering!
Based on what facts?
On the authority of whom?
Can you grill the meat?
Would you like salad?
No, take your time
He's overloaded
It won't budge!
It's getting blurry out here
He's not on my level
I'm sliding
Did you see a flash of light?
There's only so much time..
He's still got a broken heart
It's hard to find a reason
How heartbreaking..
Will you change your mind?
She's a catch
I'm not sure I can share
I'm getting impatient
It's fallen under the bed
It's stuck in the tree
Where's the molasses?
It's cut to the bone
I'm in a holding zone
Promises, promises!
What's the ransom?
I'm tongue tied
I'm on a merry-go-round
Dazzle your eyes on this!
He's running out of steam
May I speak to you outside?
Can I speak?

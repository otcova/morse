I'm happy now
Are your eyes hurting?
I won't be busy this afternoon
I'm giving up
Are you still thirsty?
I'm from here
I'd rather walk home by myself
I'm flustered
I'll be coming with my brother
I'm delighted
I'm concentrating on something
I'm coming in
That's the hard part
I'm feeling a lot better today
I'm back home
People say I'm obese
I'm glad they caught the thief
I'm at school
I'm not interested in that job
I'm angry now
Mary isn't beautiful
I'm not really sure what it is
I'm an intern
It's easy to do that
I'm not talking to you anymore
I'm an ex-con
I'm sure someone was just here
I'm a widower
Do I seem old to you?
I'm the one who has to do that
I'm a veteran
Can we talk with you?
I'm the one who washed the car
I'm a trucker
Are you still single?
I'm one of Tom's teachers
I think that that won't work
I'm a surgeon
You've paid already
I'm one of Tom's brothers
I've already washed the dishes
I'm a soldier
Why should we leave?
I'm Tom's younger brother
I've been doing this for years
I'm a skeptic
Why did you stab me?
I'm a regular
Who's idea was that?
I know his name isn't Tom
I'm a refugee
What's the big fuss?
His name isn't really Tom
I got up at 6:30
I'm a redneck
What's on your iPod?
Even Tom didn't know that
I'm a realist
What's next for you?
What does Tom do all day?
I'm a psychic
What's my next step?
Tom says I'm very stingy
I'm a plumber
What's left to lose?
I'm a painter
What'll you live on?
I'm a gymnast
We've already voted
I'm a florist
I'm a dreamer
That'll be possible
I'm a dentist
Sorry, I was a jerk
Tom didn't look offended
I'm a blogger
Please don't go yet
I'm a big guy
I'll go alone
Let's go over there
I'm one of Tom's sisters
I can't swim yet
Let's begin at 2:30
I'm Tom's younger sister
I can't hurt you
I won't budge
It's still not over
I'm Tom's French teacher
How did you respond?
How old are Tom and Mary?
Have we done enough?
You can't depend on Tom
I wasn't sick
Does your head ache?
Tom says I'm too skinny
I wasn't hurt
Who's next in line?
Tom says I'm pig-headed
Who was that woman?
What are the risks?
We're not safe yet
We can't just quit
This isn't helpful
I've just moved
I've been fired
Tom says I'm too picky
I'm your driver
Isn't that our job?
Tom says I'm too nosey
I'm very strong
Is it still Monday?
Tom says I'm too bossy
I'm unimpressed
How common is that?
I'm the copilot
I'm still woozy
Everyone's thirsty
I'm sick in bed
I'm seldom late
Doors open at 2:30
I'm Tom's older sister
I'm really sick
Don't make excuses
I'm really rich
Don't feel too bad
How's your mother, Tom?
I'm quite timid
Don't ever give in
I'm quite drunk
Don't believe this
I'm pretty rich
Don't believe them
I'm pigeon-toed
Don't believe that
I'm not winning
Do I need to go on?
I'm very close to Tom
I'm not violent
I'm intoxicated
Are you still cold?
I'm in mourning
Are you ever happy?
Why is Tom on a diet?
I'm happier now
Why can't we walk?
Tom says I'm selfish
I'm getting wet
What'll that cost?
I'm coming, too
We're out of food
I'm chewing gum
We can't use that
I'm bored stiff
I stole Tom's money
I'm at my place
I'm an outsider
This isn't unique
I was Tom's mentor
I'm a therapist
I shook Tom's hand
I'm a sophomore
I liked Tom's idea
I'm a professor
It's not too cold
How do I look, Tom?
I'm a paramedic
Everyone's sleepy
What will Tom say?
I'm a communist
Don't harm anyone
I'm a chauffeur
Do I look nervous?
I'm Tom's dentist
I'm a cameraman
What caused this?
I wasn't with Tom
I wouldn't quit
We'll begin soon
How's Tom tonight?
I won't say yes
Tom isn't stingy
I won't be back
I won't help Tom
Nobody's singing
It's not too hot
I wasn't amused
Everyone's tired
Don't be so mean
I can't help Tom
Now's my chance
Do I look drunk?
What'll Tom say?
Did you get wet?
What's changed?
I'm nice to Tom
I'm leaving Tom
I don't drive
Let's sit here
I'm Tom's niece
I'll assist Tom
I'm Tom's twin
I'm Tom's aunt
What would I do without them?
I'm going to tell Tom tomorrow
Tom didn't believe his eyes
Why isn't Tom playing with us?
What's going on with you, Tom?
Were you able to convince Tom?
You've done a good job, Tom
Tom ran to his room, crying
What should we do now, Tom?
Tom hasn't written me back
Tom didn't find Mary funny
You can count on me, Tom
Did you do that to Tom?
What should I do, Tom?
Tell me about it, Tom
I'm looking after Tom
What's going on, Tom?
We have to talk, Tom
I'm going to watch football
What type of work do you do?
Tom isn't asleep
Tom isn't my name
Tom's cup is empty
This plan won't work
Tom's dog is missing

I'm very humble
I've been lucky
Tom isn't having much luck
Tom thinks I'm very stupid

Tom's resume is impressive
Tom's success motivated me
Tom is the one who's scared
I can't read yet
Tom's condition has worsened
Tom's plan has been rejected
Tom's car isn't in the garage
Tom's father has disowned him
Tom's flight has been delayed
What's so amusing?
You don't like dancing?
The world's going mad
Why did you slap me?
Don't worry, it's not deep
The mail didn't come today
Wake up, Tom!
It's your turn!
Did you log in?
Fadil's mother remarried
Fadil really felt Dania's love
I'll love Dania for ever
I love Fadil's kisses
I'm not in love with Layla
Maybe I've loved her too much
I don't feel love for her
Are you in love with Layla?
I love you too, Fadil
Love isn't always so bitter
Fadil doesn't love me
I'm in love with someone else
I have feelings for you, Fadil

Sir, I'm a great fan of yours
Could I have your autograph?
What about your studies?
Why don't you invite him here?
Why don't you invite her here?
You must be Layla.
How did you guess?

I'm going to the repair shop
Who would like to do that?
Why did you stop it?
What happened to Fadil?
Thank you, guys
Fadil.
Yes, what's up?
Why would I?
Where could the wallet be?
You're all dirty now

Who did Fadil contact?
Don't be late, OK?
But Dad, it's Halloween.
Mom, I'm home
Fadil wasn't home
Fadil called Layla's cell
Don't worry
Thank you very much.
You're very welcome.
I'll be going now
I don't have a home yet
I'll have to go myself
Can you get me to the bridge?
I'm gonna be so late
It's my first time in Cairo
I'm so bad
Have you not practised?
How was Fadil doing at school?

That was the easy bit, though
Do you have headaches?
Don't let things go that bad
What makes you do it?
What's the reason?
I'm not telling you his name
Why'd Tom disappear?
Where might he have gone?
Do you want some advice?
Did you have a good night?

I'm done with you two
Get out.
I'm not leaving.
I'll call the cops

Finally, Fadil had enough
I remember Fadil's face
You think I'm not serious?

That's probably not true
So far, I've told no one
So far, I haven't told anyone
I know you're upset
We'll make a list
I think someone's at the door
I'd like something to write on
How could we not have noticed?
Tom can't stop me
How does Tom do it?
It's not really food
It's disturbing
Really, you are very good
Are there enough chairs?
Tom's a threat
You'll be more than welcome
Why should I trust you?
I'll come right away
Land, ho!
Will I get superpowers too?
Who asked Tom to come?
I can't wait to meet Tom
Everyone's looking for Tom
Tom hasn't seen Mary either
I haven't seen Tom for days
It's almost time for Tom to go
It's hard to keep up with Tom
It's not like Tom not to call
Whatever happened to Tom?
What'll happen to Tom now?
Who cares what happens to Tom?
Who else knew about Tom?
Who gave it to Tom?
Why not ask Tom?
Why not just tell Tom?
Why tell Tom anything?
Perhaps you've made a mistake
I already know why you're here
Could you get me another beer?
I've done some stupid things
It's perfectly safe here
Why are you really here?
How could you do this?
We'd better get ready
Are you volunteering to help?
Can you help us find Tom?
Can you help me find a job?
Did you hear what I said?
Keep your voice down, please
Can I get a witness?
When will the snow melt?
They're living in lala-land
She'll be late for the meeting
You'll go without television
I like the sound of that Bell!
Do you like Bryan Adams?
She doesn't eat beef
What exactly does this do?
I'm not sure.
I've said too much
We're being paid by the hour
If you don't tell Tom, I will
Would you please take me home?
A lot of people don't vote
I'm going to Gamelon to attack
She's reading
Am I singing that song well?
You tell jokes like Tom.
What's that supposed to mean?
They're just not funny.
He's a musicologist
I'm studying Farsi
Will you be going, too?
I can't refuse him anything
I can't refuse her anything
I'm rooting for you
I've heard that before
It's a marathon, not a sprint
It's a marathon, not a sprint
You're just in time for dinner
No, I've only just met him.
It's fun to get up early
You are welcome!
I woke up at 4 AM that day
I didn't feel well
I won a medal in 2003
Now I've got two
That was totally epic!
What an awful tragedy!
I don't want to talk about him
I don't want to talk about her
I'm tired of watching TV
Let's do something else.
Like what?
Do you like this band?
Do you read his blog?
Do you read Tom's blog?
Who's older, Tom or Mary?
Do you do this every day?
Arthur isn't as happy as Mike
I'm bigger than Sarah
This is Julia's pen
I often go to Elena's house
Mary's cat is missing
My car is at David's garage
I like my teacher's dress

Why don't you sit with Tom?
How much worse can it get?

These are my son's cookies
It's Gina's bag

My grandmother's shoes are old
The pig's s tail is curly
The cat's kittens are cute
My father's job is interesting
Where is the nearest pub?
One of my friend's dogs is fat
The mouse's tail is long
Can you tell us what happened?
Has he loved his wife so much?
Has he talked to you?
Don't put that there
Tom looked at Mary's sketches
Tom looked into Mary's eyes
I don't know how to use this
Excuse me, where's the toilet?
Excuse me, where's the Gents?
Excuse me, where's the Ladies?
I know how dangerous it'll be
I'll get the wine
Right now they're all sleeping
What do adjectives modify?
What do adverbs modify?
What can subjects be?
Articles are always what?
What are the forms of "to be"?
This is all I'm taking with me
Can you find the mistake?
Please, keep a stiff upper lip
Do you already have a plan?
Alesszia doesn't speak English
It's the story of a cat
I wish I'd been born Canadian
I wish I'd been born a boy
I wish I'd never been born
I'd rather discuss this later
I'd like to buy you a beer
I'll have to ask you to leave
I'll find out what's happening
I'm just as worried as you are
I'm just as busy as you are
I'm just as tired as you are
I'm just as hungry as you are
Tom doesn't look like me
How did Tom do this?
Let's see the results!
Why was she laughing?
Why was he laughing?
Why were you laughing?
Why was Tom laughing?
Do you like me?
Do you like dogs?
Does Tom like you?
Why do you like it?
How do you like it?
Do you like salmon?
Do you like hiking?
Do like I said, OK?
Would you like this?
Would you like some?
Why's Tom like that?
This isn't like you
Do you like my hair?
Would you like a job?
Would you like a dog?
Do you not like them?
Do you like to party?
Do you like my shoes?
Do you like football?
Would you like it now?

Would you like a bite?
I'm glad Tom liked it
Would you please leave?
Would you like to talk?
Would you like company?
Would you like to share?
Would you like some tea?
Would you like anything?
It's not like you think
That's how Tom likes it
Would you like a cupcake?
How do you like your tea?
How do you like my house?
Do you like what you see?
Do you like this perfume?
Tom doesn't like to lose
Would you like to do that?
Would you like some cider?
Would you care to comment?
Maybe you'll like it here
It's hard not to like Tom
How could Tom not like me?
I knew Tom didn't like me
Would you like us to leave?
Would you like some dinner?
What would you like to see?
Do you like these earrings?
Do it the way I'm doing it
That's the way Tom likes it
It sounds like you're tired
How did you like the concert?
Do you think Tom will like it?
It looks like we're out of gas
I'm pretty sure Tom likes Mary
No thank you, I'm full
I didn't like Tom at all
This just isn't like you
How long's Tom been sick?
How can you not like horses?
How do you like this outfit?
What would you like to hear?
What would you like to know?
Would you like that instead?
What would you like us to do?
Would you like some lemonade?
How long's Tom been like this?
How would you like to proceed?
What is it you like about Tom?
Why do you think they like it?
Why do you think Tom likes it?
Would you like a tranquilizer?
Would you like an explanation?
Would you like some breakfast?
Would you like to get slapped?
Maybe they just don't like you
You don't have to like Tom
I'd like to see you
I'd like to see him
I'd like to see it
Try your luck!
Who am I?
Where do I come from?
Is there life after death?
What is the meaning of life?
Do we know each other?
It sounds like you're doing OK
Why did Tom leave so suddenly?
You can't stay here tonight
Where are the women?
She still hasn't arrived
We were created in God's image
You were everything to me!
Tom tried to win Mary's heart
This won't hurt
Tom, you're hurting me!
Tom, wait!
Don't move!
We all know you don't drink
We all know you don't eat meat
What's the special today?
What's today's special?
We've never done this before
You don't have much time left
You don't have much more time
We don't have much time left
We don't have much more time
Do you have time for lunch?
We're wasting time here
There's an easier way to do it
I'm pretty sure Tom is right
What's so special about this?
It's a bit weak example
He doesn't say certain things
She doesn't say certain things
It's a question for the public
It isn't impossible
I'm cooking
You're cooking
She's cooking
We're cooking
They're cooking
They're reading a book
Like priest, like people
Can you be more specific?
How much snow have you had?
Why is your skirt so short?
Do you think Tom likes me?
Did you have other plans?
Are there others like you?
Were there others with you?
Is that how you do it?
Here's how we do it
I don't need an interpreter
I'd better go with Tom
I don't have a picture of Tom
There's no oxygen on the moon
Who is this young man?
Who is this young man?
A friend of mine.
Don't be fooled by her looks
Don't be fooled by his looks
Any comments?
Professor, I know why!
Why?
Because!
No!
That's not how you do it
How would you do it?
He's a man
She's a woman
I'm eating pasta
Don't lose any sleep over it
Who do you suggest we talk to?
Where would you suggest we go?
What does that suggest to you?
What are you suggesting we do?
That's a very good suggestion
I'm ordering a steak
I suggest you wait until 2:30
How do you suggest we proceed?
How do you suggest we do that?
Can you suggest a better idea?
Are you suggesting I'm a liar?
What would you suggest we do?
What would Tom suggest we do?
What are you suggesting then?
So what do you suggest we do?
Did Tom have any suggestions?
Can I just make a suggestion?
Are you open for suggestions?
Why would they suggest that?
Do you have any suggestions?

Carrà promotes the band
Carrà doesn't get his irony

He's a bit stingy
Whaat.

How much did that beer cost?
Where did you study?
Why is he learning Spanish?

It's never going to happen
Don't let that happen again
What happened after we left?
Have you ever read the Bible?
What's happening to you?
And that's what happened
Has this happened before?
It couldn't happen to me
It'll never happen again
It's all happening again

I'm sorry I'm late
It won't happen again
If that happens, I'll resign
Is it going to happen again?
Is that the way it happened?
Is that what happened to you?
Is that what really happened?
It didn't happen all at once
It never should've happened
It shouldn't have happened
It wasn't supposed to happen
It'll happen quite quickly
It's all happening so fast
It's already happened
It's amazing what can happen
It's going to happen today
It's going to happen soon
It's happened three times now
It's happening all over again
It's happening now, isn't it?
It's never happened before
It's what was meant to happen
Look at what's happening
Nothing's happening down there
Nothing's happening right now
Now let's see what happens
Now, why would that happen?
So, did anything happen?
Something's happening here
Something's happened to it
That's happened to a lot of us

Let's name our cat Cookie
What's your favorite boy band?
Do you like kombucha?
What's your cat's name?
Why were you holding her hand?
Why were you holding his hand?
Do you know anybody named Tom?
There's no one named Tom here
Do you like Tom's tattoo?
Do you like Tom's tattoos?
I don't like the new guy
I don't like the new guy.
Do you mean Tom?
I think that he likes you.
Why were you holding his hand?
I wasn't holding his hand!
Why were you holding her hand?
I wasn't holding her hand!
You won't be arrested
Who taught you how to do that?
When'll we know how Tom is?
That's how we do things
Let's see how you like it
Just how do you know all this?
How will Tom get in?
How long's Tom been gone?
How is that my fault?
How do you think it went?
How do you know about this?
How do you do it exactly?
How did you get inside?
How did Tom get one of those?
How could Tom do that?
How can we know for sure?
How are you being treated?
How are we going to get in?
Here's how we're going to win
Exactly how will we do that?
Do you know how Tom did it?
Do you know how that looks?
Do you know how that feels?
Do you know how it works?
Can you see how it works?
There's nothing to see here
Let's see if anybody's home
I still haven't seen it
I should've seen that coming
I haven't seen this in a while
I can't see who it is
Do you want to go see a movie?
You'd better come see this
Why is the door open?
Why don't you come with us?
Why all the secrecy?
Where's the noise coming from?
Where does all this come from?
Where do these come from?
Where did all this come from?
When did Tom come back?
That'll come in handy, I think
Please come by 2:30
Please come before 2:30
Please come at 2:30
Let's go outside and play
It hasn't come to that yet
I can't come in today
Hi, come on in
Hey, come here
I've gotten hungry
That isn't how it happened
If that happens, call me
Just don't let it happen again
Let Tom know what's happening
That wasn't supposed to happen
That's exactly how it happened
That's not the way it happened
That's precisely what happened
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
This isn't supposed to happen
This wasn't supposed to happen
What's happened is unimportant
This never should've happened
I can't see what's happening
What could've happened to Tom?
It's a very beautiful sapling
Why Link?
It is written here!
Who wrote it?
Why does this happen so often?
Where did you see that happen?
What's happening right now?
What was supposed to happen?
Trust me, I can make it happen
That's the way it happened
It's not like it just happened
It's happened to us all before
It'll happen, I'm sure of it
Did Tom see what happened?
I'm just fucking with you, man
Yeah!
That old king is the boss!
Keep me posted.
Sure thing.
Bye.
Bye.
That's probably what happened
That didn't really happen
Nobody's told me what happened
It doesn't matter what happens
Did something happen to Tom?
Have a good day!
How exactly did that happen?
It's a terrible thing
You've made a terrible mistake
You're doing a terrible thing
Tom, you look terrible
What happened?
Do you know where the leak is?
I'm eating a sandwich
I'm drinking milk
It's a threat
I've found a job
Let me explain what's happened
It's not likely to happen soon
Don't call her that
Don't call him that
I know what's going to happen
I don't know what might happen
Tom, look at me!
I didn't mean to insult you
I'll see what can be done
I'm quite a bit older than you
Is there enough gravy?
I'm not overreacting
It's not exactly a secret
It'll happen to you, too
I didn't detach them
I think that's enough, Tom
Can you stop calling me that?
Why do you like horses?
I've always loved horses
Why do horses wear blinders?
Why do horses wear blinkers?
Great luck doesn't come twice
They're preparing food
Want to come with us and try?
I can't stand him any more
We can't let that happen again
Are you turning red?
I'm waiting for the trolley
Stop it already!
It's pretty damn good!
Birthday events don't count
Don't worry, it will be nice
It's finally here
There's also a yellow one
Who gave this to Tom?
Where were you in 1979?
It's my mistake, not yours
You're more beautiful than me
Whose military is in Crimea?
What is this girl's name?
What do they call this girl?
Where's Takayama?
Understand?
I'm working, but you're not
And where were you?
He wasn't a good politician
I'll lend you one, if you wish
You're afraid of this?
You're a real witch
What do you want to say to me?
When did your dad come home?
Victoria died in 1901
She's both tall and fat
Watch out for the car!
Why are you so quarrelsome?
It's cold in my city, Warsaw
Why are you stupid?
I'm not stupid.
Didn't anything else happen?
I'm sorry that happened to you
Don't touch my sandwich
I won't give you my sandwich
I'm just kidding
That really didn't happen
Why do you like Boston?
She's a musicologist
You aren't very funny
Why won't Tom listen to me?
Why is Tom learning French?
Why are you protecting Tom?
Where did Tom go yesterday?
Tom's very sophisticated
Tom isn't very sophisticated
Tom isn't sophisticated
I think Tom's unsophisticated
We're all inexperienced
We can't leave Tom behind
Don't ask, and I won't lie
I don't like samba
I'm concerned about him
I'm concerned about her
I'm supposed to help
Please don't tell anybody
Does she like her job?
I'll lend you one if you wish
Tom's wife is also a scientist
I bet you can't catch me
I am not an owl!
I'm not an owl!
Do you eat fish?
What should I do today?
She works well, just as usual
This is bullshit!
Don't bullshit me
Who the fuck is Tom?
For God's sake, what happened?
What the fuck is your problem?
I'm just messing with you
I'm just fucking with you
She's a basket case
Who's that in the corner?
That's Tom
Don't mind him.
I'm not much older than he is
He's an accomplished artist
She's an accomplished artist
Where are you taking him?
Where are you taking her?
There isn't much time left
He's mine
She's mine
She's lactose intolerant
Can you speak Turkmen?
I don't need a hot bath
Why is it out of the question?
Why did you ask that question?
What's your next question?
What's with all the questions?
What questions did they ask?
Tom ignored Mary's question
There's no time for questions
That's the wrong question
That's not a fair question
That's not a bad question
That's an offensive question
That's an interesting question
That's an excellent question
That's a ridiculous question
That's a reasonable question
That's a really good question
That's a legitimate question
That's a great question
That's a good question to ask
That's a fascinating question
That's a dumb question
That's a complicated question
That's a big question
Now, let me ask you a question
No more questions, please
May I ask you some questions?
May I ask Tom a few questions?
May I ask a stupid question?
May I ask a quick question?
May I ask a personal question?
It's not a trick question
It's not a rhetorical question
It's just a simple question
It's a yes or no question
It's a very serious question
It's a simple question
It's a questionable policy
It's a question of will power
It's a question of principle
It's a question of integrity
It's a legitimate question
It's a difficult question
It's a complicated question
Is this a trick question?
Is that a trick question?
Is that a serious question?
Is that a rhetorical question?
I question Tom's motives
Do you remember the question?
Did you answer Tom's question?
Did Tom ask you any questions?
Did Tom ask any questions?
Could I ask you a question?
Can I ask one more question?
Are you questioning my plan?
Are you questioning my orders?
Are there any other questions?
Are there any more questions?
What will be my legacy?
Who was Abraham?
What will change everything?
Which bee has bit you?
What bee has stung you?
You're a doctor
She's a doctor
We're doctors
You're doctors
They're doctors
Are you an Ethiopian?
She's a good woman
Yes, she's at home
Yes, he's at home
Yeah!
Tom, get down from that tree!
Get down from that tree!
I don't want to get in the way
My car's over there
Mom, can I watch TV?
No, you can't Tom.
Dad, can I watch TV?
You thought I wouldn't notice?
Welcome to my house, finally
Don't you think he's cute?
Don't you think she's cute?
She's never had a boyfriend
He's never had a girlfriend
What else could it be?
You're free to go
Have you already been to Nara?
It's your turn to deal
Where do you suggest we go?
What did Tom suggest we do?
I'll do as you suggested
As suggested, I'll call Tom
Mom, let's go!
I don't wanna be here
No way!
They're eating brioche bread
You could hang me if I'm lying
That's a jewish cult
Don't just stand there
Do you want to go somewhere?
Do you want to go somewhere?
Tom's coming, too
I'm playing with my Dreamcast
Yeah, let's go!
Don't be nervous!
This class is easy!
Don't go near that!
Yeah!
Cement hardens in 2-3 hours
Did you watch it?
I'm grateful for what you did
I don't think it's a big deal
We don't know what to do
Wow, look at these prices!
The price doesn't matter
That's the price of success
That's a small price to pay
That's a reasonable price
That's a good price
Price isn't an issue
It's worth the price
It's not a matter of price
It's a bit pricey
I'm doubling my prices
I'll give you a fair price
I think it's worth the price
I can't see the price tag
That was Tom's plan all along
Was it just a game to you?

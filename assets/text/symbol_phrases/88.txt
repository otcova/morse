Can I exchange it for today's?
That isn't really worth it
Learn how to cook!
I don't have health problems
I bet I'll see Tom there
That's just what I hope to do
That isn't all I had to do
Use this if you're in danger
I don't think Tom heard us
You don't need to be scared
Who's your master?
That isn't what I think
Will we see each other again?
He's trying to do what he can
We're nearing Istanbul
That isn't what you promised
Why don't my parents love me?
What's that?
That's a Jewish star.
What's that?
It's a Jewish star.
What's that?
It's a Magen David.
What's that?
That's a Magen David.
I don't know how it will end
He'll spend some time in jail
What was that teacher's name?
That's not my decision to make
That's not a secret anymore
That isn't our agreement
Tom didn't understand why
I'd like to use these coupons
They didn't visit Uganda
What sports do you practice?
That isn't Tom's passport

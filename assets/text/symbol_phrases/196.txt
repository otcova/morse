Now it's all clear to me
Now it's up to me
You don't listen to me
You're very special to me
Don't compare yourself to me
That's not acceptable to me
Life's been good to me
Someone's spying on me
Tom couldn't run away from me
I'll take you with me
I'll have to take Tom with me
Don't try to catch me
They're bothering me
Maybe they'll recognize me
You don't really love me
I didn't expect you to love me
Maybe they'll believe me
I didn't like what Tom gave me
Don't ever leave me
I don't want you to leave me
You shouldn't underestimate me
They can't fire me
I'm glad you like me
Tom still doesn't like me
No one's going to see me
Tom didn't notice me
Don't try to bribe me
You've misunderstood me
You could've invited me
You could've asked me
You've already convinced me
How could it not matter?
Is this a serious matter?
What did Tom say to Mary?
Did you propose to Mary?
I've written to Tom about Mary
Tom didn't hurt Mary
Tom couldn't even look at Mary
Tom didn't want to bother Mary
I told Tom that I'd help Mary
Tom didn't talk to Mary
Tom couldn't speak to Mary
I'm sure Tom was nice to Mary
Tom didn't let go of Mary
Tom didn't want to lose Mary
I'm sure Tom will like Mary
Tom was sure you'd like Mary
Tom didn't want to see Mary
Tom must've gone to see Mary
Tom should've called Mary
Are you already married?
I'll do it manually
It's mandatory
Are you the bank manager?
Who was the man?
I'm a very, very happy man
You're a cruel man
You're a rich man
How many cookies did you make?
You've got it made
Did you buy a washing machine?
Why do you think I'm lying?
You're just hungover
You'll feel better after lunch
We've just finished lunch
I'm also very lucky
I'm not that lucky
We've had too much bad luck
What would I know about love?
Am I in love?
I don't deserve your love
I'm officially in love
I'll miss you a lot
I've seen a lot
You've helped me a lot
I've moved a lot
What've you lost?
I hope you don't get lost
You're a real loser
What have I got to lose?
What else I can lose?
Of course, I always lose
We're probably going to lose
Tom isn't as bad as he looks
Do you think I'm good-looking?
We can't stay any longer
I couldn't wait any longer
Did you wait long?
Why did you wait so long?
Are you going to be here long?
We didn't wait that long
It won't seem so long
It'll take you too long
We don't plan to be here long
I don't want you to be lonely
What causes loneliness?
Are all the windows locked?
Are the windows all locked?
We're going to need a loan
Does it snow where you live?
I'm just listening
All right, I'm listening
Why couldn't you listen?
Who's next on your list?
Do you want to see the list?
Do you want a list?
You're not on my list
I'll send you the list
What's the limit?
What bands do you like?
What does it smell like?
What does it taste like?
What does it sound like?
Do you know what I like?
Do you want me in your life?
Don't try to control my life
I'm bored with my life
Tom's risking his life
Was that a lie?
Why would I lie?
I don't want to lie
I'll write you a letter
I'm not always so lenient
Did you shave your legs?
That's not legal
How much money is left?
Do you know why Tom left?
Is that why Tom left?
How many do you have left?
You should've turned left
I think it's time I left
Why are you leaving?
How soon can you leave?
Did you ask Tom to leave?
Do I really have to leave?
When do you have to leave?
How soon do we have to leave?
Isn't it time to leave?
Would you like me to leave?
It's time for you to leave
I'm going to leave
Obviously, it's time to leave
Of course, you can leave
I really do wish you'd leave
There's still a lot to learn
There's so much to learn
There's still much to learn
There's always more to learn
I'm here to learn
What made you laugh?
Don't you ever laugh?
Do you ever laugh?
I don't like to laugh
I've never seen Tom laugh
Why don't we do this later?
We'll stop by later
We'll join you later
Tom said he'd do it later
We'll deal with it later
I'll pay for this later
I'll answer my email later
I'd prefer to talk later
You'll understand later
I've been very happy lately
Why do you always arrive late?
I'm almost always late
I'm always late
You're not too late
I'm sorry to be late
I didn't want to be late
I knew you'd be late
Tom knew that he'd be late
Let's hope it lasts
When were you here last?
Tom's family isn't very large
Tom fell off his mother's lap
Who are these young ladies?
We don't know what Tom knows
Does Tom know that you know?
Didn't you know?
What exactly do you know?
What would you know?
What do we need to know?
Tom is my friend, you know
They're armed with knives
Do you have a knife?
It's a kitchen knife
Can I see you in the kitchen?
Did you see the kids?
I'm a big kid
Has anyone seen my keys?
Did you take my car keys?
Tom asked if I'd found my key
Tom's a great journalist
This time I'm not joking
You've got to be joking!
I didn't understand your joke
I didn't understand the joke
Tell me that's a joke
What a stupid joke!
Do you miss your old job?
Does Tom already have a job?
Have you ever had a job?
Actually, it's my job
I wouldn't accept that job
Tom can't do this job
I can't do this job
I haven't found a job
I'm beginning to get jealous
Mary's maiden name is Jackson
How will you fix it?
How would you fix it?
Are you sure you saw it?
What can you do about it?
What's so good about it?
Should I repeat it?
Did you get a look at it?
That's from Tom, isn't it?
Do we need to discuss it?
Didn't you miss it?
Are you going to miss it?
What exactly is it?
Are you sure this is it?
How cold is it?
It's not true, is it?
What kind of gun was it?
How large was it?
How would you repair it?
Why can't they do it?
Why do they do it?
Can't you do it?
Why can't you just do it?
Did Tom ask you to do it?
Who's going to do it?
Do they have to do it?
Were you able to do it?
What else would you call it?
What's Tom got to do with it?
Did you push it?
Why aren't you using it?
Why did you bring it?
Why are you doing it?
How are you managing it?
Why were you reading it?
What did you think of it?
Do you really believe it?
How did you measure it?
How did you handle it?
Why else do you like it?
Where can I find it?
Did you really understand it?
Why would you need it?
How long have you had it?
I'd buy it
It's useless to deny it
I'm so sorry about it
We're all very happy about it
I didn't know about it
I've spoken to Tom about it
Don't think about it
We can't do anything about it
I knew you'd get it
I'm beginning to doubt it
I'm not good at it
You shouldn't even consider it
Next time, don't drop it
Tom wouldn't let Mary keep it
I'd be happy to keep it
I'd look into it
I'll try to do it
It's the only way to do it
I'll find a way to do it
I didn't know how to do it
I'd do it
I'll continue working on it
Look, I can't explain it
You obviously haven't seen it
Tom said he'd never seen it
I think it's worth it
Sorry, I can't reach it
Of course, I'm denying it
I'm quite sure of it
I've never heard of it
Actually, I did write it
Tom can't use it
I'm trying to ignore it
I've already done it
I told you you'd like it
I told you that you'd like it
I won't go to see it
I can't even pronounce it
Unfortunately, I can't find it
I really can't understand it
I'm trying to understand it
I can't believe we did it
I'd like to read it
It's a complex issue
Who do you think that guy is?
Is that the way it really is?
Do you know where it is?
Do you know what fear is?
Do you know where the cake is?
Don't you know who he is?
We don't even know what it is
We don't even know where it is
I don't know what the plan is
You're almost as old as Tom is
I don't even know who he is
We don't like to get involved
Why was Tom invited?
Why was I invited?
How was your job interview?
I don't want to intervene
I won't interfere
I don't want to interfere
Do you find that interesting?
I'm sure you'll be interested
What's your intention?
What did you do instead?
What should I do instead?
What do you propose instead?
Who was your inspiration?
Do you suffer from insomnia?
You're too insistent
Would you come back inside?
Was anyone injured?
It's incomprehensible
Why won't you let us in?
Can I join in?
What hospital is Tom in?
Are you going to move in?
How could you turn me in?
I'll be right in
You shouldn't let Tom in
You've definitely improved
The situation hasn't improved
I'm trying to improve
So far, I'm not impressed
They say it's impossible
I know that's impossible
We can't do the impossible
How could that be important?
They say it's important
I'll do that immediately
That's not illegal
You're just idiots
Are you a complete idiot?
You're too idealistic
What's wrong with my idea?
Does anyone have an idea?
Why is that a good idea?
Do you think it's a good idea?
Why is that a bad idea?
It's really a nice idea
It wasn't a bad idea
What a brilliant idea!
What a weird idea!
I'm not a hypocrite
Does it really hurt?
Where were you hurt?
Was anyone hurt?
It didn't hurt
Do I need to hurry?
I won't make you hurry
Come on, we need to hurry
Do you want to go hunting?
Didn't you get hungry?
Tom didn't seem very hungry
I don't want you to go hungry
Tom didn't seem hungry
I'm sure you're hungry
I'm cold and hungry
What's causing that hum?
It's close to my house
That's my father's house
I went to Tom's house
Let's go to your house
I'll come to your house
I'm looking for a cheap hotel
Aren't you a little hot?
Why would they want a hostage?
They've got a hostage
We'll be at the hospital
Where's my horse?
Who stole my horse?
I'm beginning to lose hope
You'll always love me, I hope

I can't take it home
Tonight, I'll stay at home
Luckily, you were at home
Let's send them all home
Let's go back home
I'm here on holiday
Where's your pot holder?
It's one of my hobbies
Unfortunately, it's a hoax
Tom's talking to himself
Tom can't eat it all himself
I polished Tom's shoes for him
I told Tom that I'd help him
Tom doesn't know I like him
Are you going to hide?

They know we're out here
Let's not talk about that here
We can't do that here
They won't find us here
We can't leave this here
You're never here
Tom didn't graduate from here
The others don't want Tom here
You know why I'm here
That's why I'm here

We all know why you're here
Tom doesn't know we're here
Everybody, come here
It's my first time here
You're perfectly safe here
We're not safe here
We aren't safe here
You didn't need to be here
Tom shouldn't even be here
I'm on guard here
We're almost finished here
How can I be helpful?
You're always so helpful
It'll be helpful
Why do you need my help?
Did you help?
Did I ask for your help?
Do you want Tom to help?
Are you offering to help?
Do you still want me to help?
Were you able to help?
Would you please help?
I'm sorry I can't help
This time, I can't help
Listen, I need your help
I'd be more than happy to help
Tom said he'd be happy to help
Look, you've got to help
Tom didn't ask me to help
I should've been able to help
Maybe you'd like to help
Tom didn't agree to help
I'll see if I can help
Maybe you'll need more help
Tom said that he'd help
Are you wearing heels?
I'm heartbroken
Did Tom break your heart?
Do you hear what I hear?
Have you seen the headlines?
I think I'll shave my head
Maybe I'll shave my head
Tom couldn't see Mary's face
Tom isn't the one, is he?
How many goats do they have?
What advantage do they have?
What flavors do you have?
What ideas do you have?
What choice do you have?
What choice did we have?
How much more time do I have?
Tom can't find his hat
Don't be too hasty
Next time, I'll try harder
Why should I work hard?
It's raining pretty hard
I think it's really hard
I'm ready to work hard
I know it'll be hard
Are you still not happy?
Are you really that happy?
You've made me very happy
I knew Tom wasn't happy
Tom isn't rich, but he's happy
That won't make Tom happy
Tom didn't seem happy
That won't make me happy
You'll soon be happy
I hope you'll be happy
I want to see what's happening
Who knows what happened?
Can I ask what happened?
What was about to happen?

Have you dyed your hair?
I'm losing my hair
It's now a habit
It's time to go to the gym
I'll wait in the gym
What can I do for you guys?
They're all good guys
Wow, you're a lucky guy
I don't like that guy
They're armed with guns
Have you given Tom a gun?
Can you use a gun?
It could've been a gun
Do you ever feel guilty?
Of course, I feel guilty
Do you want me to guess?

We're very good friends
We're all still good friends
You're very friendly
It's for my friend
You're my closest friend
I'll never be your friend
I'll be your friend
I'm just a freshman
Do you know any French?
Are you still studying French?
Are you learning French?
Could you teach me French?
Tom isn't good at French
I've started to learn French
Most of it's in French
It's not written in French
Is it really free?
Did you really do it for free?
What else have you found?
Has a solution been found?
Here's what we found
How could I have forgotten?
Some things can't be forgotten
We'll never forget
What do you need it for?
What do you need us for?
What am I doing this for?
What do you need this for?
What does Tom need this for?
What do I need this for?
So, what're you waiting for?
What was Tom waiting for?
What are they asking for?
Who were you looking for?
What are we looking for?
Who will you vote for?
What was Tom there for?
What did you come in here for?
What do you need me for?
It's all paid for
These aren't what I asked for
I'm not interested in football
Maybe I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool
You shouldn't eat fatty foods
Do we have any food?
We'll bring plenty of food
We'll have plenty of food
I've watered all the flowers
Do you want to go fishing?

We've already finished
We've finished
I can't wait to finish

I guess that's final
Do you have a nail file?
Why are we still fighting?
I've never lost a fight
You're an expert in the field
I've seen a few
I've got a fever
I'll come by ferry
So how did you really feel?
It's one of my favorites
Can you do me one last favor?
Is that my fault?
How's that your fault?
It's completely my fault
It's probably my fault
Maybe it wasn't my fault
It's not anyone's fault
It's always your fault
It's my own fault
That was Tom's own fault
Don't use this faucet
Who's your father?
I'm afraid of your father
Do you think I look fat?
You've gotten fat
Tom is very old-fashioned
Do I look like a farmer?
They can't have gone far
It's fantastic
I'm not a fanatic
I'm not a fan
I don't live with my family
Don't worry about your family
You're part of the family
Why do you look familiar?
I think that's fake
You weren't fair
I think it's fair
That's fair
You're not being fair
You aren't being fair
That wouldn't be fair
Why did we fail?
We don't know that for a fact
What's that on your face?
Let's talk face to face
Come on, close your eyes
Now everything's exposed
How could it have exploded?
There's no explanation
What should I explain?
Look, I'm not an expert
I know it's an experiment
Do you have any experience?
I know it'll be expensive
It's not what I expected
What can you expect?
What else can you expect?
What else should we expect?
Do you have a back exit?
Does that still exist?
I've finished my exams
Could you give an example?
You're always exaggerating
Now don't exaggerate
What do you mean exactly?
What do you need exactly?
It's evil
Do you have any evidence?
Didn't you find any evidence?
Did you really eat everything?
Did you understand everything?
Soon you'll know everything
Now I'll tell you everything
I'll try to forget everything

Do we have anything else?
Have you met anyone else?
You can't say anything else
I'm looking for something else
I'd like to eat somewhere else
You're just like everyone else
Don't be like everyone else
I'm looking for someone else
Please don't waste electricity
You weren't elected
I can't see it either

I couldn't believe it, either
I didn't believe it, either
Tom doesn't like it, either
I'm not enjoying this, either
I'm still eating
I don't want to eat
Would it really be that easy?
It's become very easy
Don't give up so easily
Why are you here so early?
It's not too early
We'll try to be there early
Actually, we're a little early
Does that mean I'm dying?
I'm just doing my civic duty
That's dumb

They weren't drunk
We weren't drunk
I guess I'm a little drunk
We'll all soon be drunk

I don't like that dress
Tell me I'm not dreaming
Do you like to draw?
What conclusions can we draw?

Why are we slowing down?
Do you need to lie down?
Let's go and sit down
I'd better write that down
Does anyone still have doubts?
I'm beginning to have doubts
Is there any doubt?
Did you shut the door?
Why didn't you lock the door?
Don't shut the door
Tom didn't even shut the door
Tom's wife met him at the door
What else have you done?
How could it have been done?
What should we have done?
I don't like what Tom has done
Now look what you've done
Now look what I've done
There's a lot left to be done
What were you really doing?
What are you girls doing?
What are you kids doing?
What are your kids doing?

Should I call the doctor?
Why did you become a doctor?
How did they do?
So, what would you do?
What did they ask you to do?
What does Tom want to do?
Don't you know what to do?
Could you tell me what to do?
What do you expect us to do?
What are we trying to do?
What were they going to do?
What else are we going to do?
Is that all you have to do?
Now what do I have to do?
What does Tom want me to do?
What do kids like to do?
What are you supposed to do?
So, what do we need to do?
What does this button do?
What else could Tom do?
What does that thing do?
What more can I do?
There's nothing better to do
We don't have anything to do
It's the smart thing to do
It's all you really can do
It's the least we can do
I don't see what we can do
Tell me what you'll do
Yeah, that's what I'll do
Tom didn't know what he'd do
Yeah, that's what I'd do
I can't jump over that ditch
Sorry, I was distracted
That's really disgusting
It's disgusting
It's a bad disease
What are you discussing?
Let's not get discouraged

It's slow going.
But still!
It's progressing slowly
It'll do for now.
I've got to put my glasses on
I just can't see them
I just can't see them
That can't be
It can't be
You don't often smile
Bob broke Tom's spine
Mary's not in her room
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Tom's son lost his toys
Tom's daughter lost her toys
Maybe someone's watching us
Somebody stole Tom's laptop
Can you pay for this purse?
Snooping as usual, I see
Alone on a Friday night?
God, you’re pathetic
What's causing this pain?
We've succeeded
Nobody's right
Everybody's wrong
Everyone's wrong
Is she at least pretty?
What is alternative energy?
It'll rain until Sunday
The whole world's in our hands
Do you see anything there?
It can't cost that much
Where did you buy the bread?
They don't remember each other
I'm Czech, and you?
What city does she live in?
Give the boy a toy, Tom
No dogs!
How do you stop it?
It's my dream
Where did he find it?
Everyone's depressed
I didn't see him fall
Really?
When did he leave?
Who drank the water?
What is a postal code?
You speak English really well.
Philology?
What's that?
Don't you mean languology?
Where's his picture?
Tom isn't a nurse
And then you ate it?
I don't want to answer
Why did you love him?
Nobody believes that.
Well, almost nobody.
Yes, I would.
Bye-Bye.
Yeah, I'll be off now.
Tom was Mary's first manager
Can't you write to me?
Tell Tom I'm watching the news
Endure!
Tolerate!
Allow me!
Let me!
Let us sleep!
Let's sleep!
She's looking for her camera
You're such a show off
Does she have a garden?
Do they have a garden?
Don't change horses mid-race
Maria doesn't speak German
I'm always in a bad mood
You're incredible
Did you know that?
You ask her, damn it!
I'm not at all conventional
I'll travel the world one day
Did you say hi to Mary?
When are you coming here?
Am I being silly enough?
I don't need your help, thanks
Did she leave the group?
Did she leave the group chat?
I don't intend on having kids
I should've called her
Did you sprain your ankle?
He can't have gone far
She can't have gone far
I'm a whore
Tom isn't a chess player
Who got it dirty?
Who dirtied it?
There's an impostor among us
They're both married
I don't dance in public
Tom's concert was very good
Why is everyone ignoring me?
Why's everybody ignoring me?
No one's ignoring you, Mary
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
It didn't cost me very much
It's a family business
Why are you such a pessimist?
He's growing up fast
That's probably even worse.
I've fallen for the trap
I don't share anything
What's demonography?
That says demography, Tom.
Yes.
My bad, my bad
I don't mind.
Um..
You got a star!
How diverse is your data set?
Don't I need my patient ID?
It's 300 kilometers to Boston
I hope I don't have any dreams
Can you get COVID twice?
It's still a little scary
You're very good at sewing
Tom needed Mary's support
Let's give Tom more support
It's up to us to support Tom
Can we do that job wirelessly?
I think I'm in over my head
What was the letter about?
Yanni says he's already bored
They canceled Yanni's card
Yanni wasn't neglected
Yanni's sadness was unbearable
Yanni didn't know the way home
Yanni didn't know the way
Yanni didn't eat anything
Yanni didn't touch the food
Yanni shared Rima's video
Yanni is pretty sure it's Rima
What's Yanni doing in Algeria?
Why did Yanni abandon Rima?
Yanni's parents suck
Yanni's life depends on that
Yanni probably didn't cry
Yanni's story is worse
Yanni doesn't talk to Rima
Yanni doesn't know who you are
Yanni was Rima's son
Yanni's car was really small
Yanni knows Rima's family
Tom should've let you do that
Rima is Yanni's middle sister
Yanni seeks Rima's validation
Yanni seeks Rima's approval
What disturbed Tom so much?
Yanni's room was very dark
Yanni's estate was in disarray
Where did he buy it?
You're a cat, Cookie
Get cancer!
Tom wasn't as lucky as we were
Whose scheme is this?
Let's not be discouraged
Have a burger!
It was 23 dollars
That’s what it is about
I don't watch soap operas
So what if I am a goblin?
I do hope Tom wasn't injured
Tom doesn't have a role model
Tom hasn't got a role model
Did you shout for me?
Tom's missed the train
He's not coming.
I see.
I don't know this spot
Will you help me?
I think we're lost.
That may well be.
I'm playing the piano
Tom would like a wet flannel.
What for?
He didn't say.
Tom hasn't yet been in touch
Tom hasn't been in touch yet
Can you explain why that is?
I've made a note of the date
Does that interest you?
Are you interested in that?
Are you interested in this?
Here's my mobile.
What's the quickest way home?
They're all just words
I couldn't think of her name.
Her name escaped me.
She's just telephoned
Paul's just telephoned
I'm just looking
I'm just looking round
Have you brought some tea?
Did you bring some tea?
Have you brought some milk?
Did you bring some milk?
Have you brought the tea?

Have you brought the milk?
Did you bring the milk?
Has Tom passed the exam?
Only just.
Did Tom pass the exam?
Only just.
Did Tom pass the exam?
He just scraped through it.
Did Tom pass the exam?
By the skin of his teeth.
Is he married?
Maybe, maybe not.
Let's see what he can do
I can't find my prazosin
He's a fussy cat
Can you help me translate?
She can go but I can't go
It's no longer snowing
In brief, Tom was wrong
I don't have cows
You don't have cows
We don't have cows
They don't have cows,
I'm beat
I'm tuckered out
I don't want to play now
Have you read what I wrote?
They're all innocent children
I'm alone, but I'm not lonely
Finally, Tom attained his goal
Finally, Tom reached his goal
Finally, Tom achieved his goal
Is that Tom over there?
It's called Tatoeba
Is your bag empty?
Copyright isn't legitimate
I'm thankful to my friends
Poverty isn't cool
There's nothing in the bottle
Tom's debit card expired
What's the interest rate?
Your shirt's inside out.
Those are my shoes!
Give them back; you are a dog!
They don't even fit!
Yes, Einstein smoked a pipe
That's my cellphone
Give it back!
I didn't do it
Do you want a Cookie?
Do you hate playing with me?
You aren't consistent
You're not consistent
I'm poor at swimming
I'm poor at drawing
They're too close
I'm on holiday this week
It's five minutes to nine
I'll write you back soon
Do you have this in a size 13?
Tom's debit card has expired
I can't stop Tom from doing it
I hope everyone's OK
What do rabbits eat?
Yes, fourteen children
Trust me, Ziri will thank you
Ziri's house collapsed
Ziri sabotaged Rima's truck
Communism wouldn't hold out
Ziri's house was rundown
Ziri didn't see anything
Ziri wasn't sure
Ziri wasn't familiar with that
Ziri didn't look like a hunter
Ziri didn't believe it
Ziri didn't believe that
We didn't interfere
I won't get vaccinated
Don't make unfounded claims
I haven't eaten too much
Tom didn't work yesterday
I don't care if you shun me
You're way out of line, buddy
We're the best of friends
I'm glad that Tom likes it
Don't let her drink this juice
Where are my marbles?
If you snitch, you're dead
He's the same age as my sister
It's very hot here in summer
I've just got home

You're in it!
Is that mic off?
Who's coming to the party?
What's going on down there?
What are they doing?
How long till we arrive?
Where is the home?
Will you get vaccinated?
He's peeling his apple
It'll cost you 45 cents
It's easy to add 5 to 10
I just really wanted gumballs.
It's you who's to blame
It's cool after the rain
Maybe Mary doesn't like that
Tom thinks he's Louis XIV
Ziri's body is so tired
I'm tired of the work
Ziri's parents got divorced
Ziri knows what's going on
I'm able to swim here
I didn't know Tom liked anime.
I'll be back by nine
It's nice and cool here
It's out of fashion
It's rather warm today
Check it, please
I hate Tom's cat
Do I look like your servant?
Do you dress fashionably?
This won't cost you anything
I'm just kidding
That's anecdotal evidence
Are the roses blue?
Do you have a blue car?
Don't touch the blue button
She's wearing a blue skirt
I'll be wearing a blue shirt
Is this your cup?
No, mine's blue.
With a heart on it.
Did anyone see that?
Mary is hot on Toms' heels
How many girls have you dated?
How many guys have you dated?
I didn't get any of it
Think, everyone!
Think, everyone!
Oh, there are!
That's what I'm here for
Do you know?
It's playtime
What is your type?
What type of guy is your type?
There's some truth in that
There's some truth in this
There's some truth to that
There's something in that
Who is this letter for?
Do your parents know?
I'll really miss this house.
We'll all miss it, Tom.
He's a difficult cat to please
You don't need to remind me
What if you lived in Algiers?
You're all insane, you know
Her father-in-law is strict
Is he Mahmut?
Why can't you swim here?
What does this woman want?
Yes, I'll probably be at home
Why can't you fish here?
I've read all your books
There's someone new in my life
I'm weak in history
I'm weak on history
I'm weak at history
I'm sitting in the garden
I can't talk right now
I'll call you within an hour
The man lives on Kīlauea
He is wrong, isn't he?
Are we making any impact?
Very fast, very inquisitive
Soup is God's gift to us
They're all irritable
I'm poor at tennis
She's a teacher at that school
Isn't that table dirty?
Start on March 23
She'll know
We didn't order that
It's a stupid proposal
I'm not ready to do it
They're going to scold me
Don't worry about the stain
I'm just being real
I'm just keeping it real
I played with Walid's toys
He played with Walid's toys
She played with Walid's toys
We played with Walid's toys
They played with Walid's toys
I'm listening to a new song
Will you meet me off the bus?
That's a novel view, isn't it
I'm fluent in Google Translate
It's just five o'clock
It's almost ten o'clock
It's almost twelve o'clock
Sadly, he died a month ago
I'm typing
Someone's spying on us
When was that law abolished?
I wish you weren't so busy
That law was abolished in 2013
How many Toms do you know?
His father-in-law is strict
Who will operate on Tom?
You're OK, yes?
It's a dirty trick
That's a dirty trick
Your tiredness disappeared?
Your fatigue disappeared?
Did your tiredness disappear?
Did your fatigue disappear?
Open your hand!
Open your hands!
Open your hands wide!
Spread your hands!
Spread your hands wide!
Spread your hands wide open!
Dude, trust me
I'm poor at customer service
This is my opinion", he said
He couldn't bear the pain
I can't believe I was there
You can't see me
But you do belong.
Be long.
Do you even translate, bro?
Sadly, he died a month ago
I'll travel
I'm sure he's innocent
You're not in China
Get it yourself!
He's only writing the truth
Do you have any whiteout?
They think I'm strong
Who did this to me?
Why don't they get married?
I hope they're okay
How about this color?
I don't have money right now
Who wants to go again?
I can't understand women
Will the game be on TV?
Why don't you like soccer?
They shot us in the back, too
They backstabbed us, too
I'm super confused
I'm a mailman
I'm a letter carrier
Is that how you see me?
She wakes up around 7 o'clock
Coffee?
Yes, please.
Why did you tell me this?
Can I speak with Tom, please?
Did you really get a ticket?
Did you really get fined?
How much does this car cost?
What day is it, anyway?
She's not here yet
He's fine
Thank you!
I'm really happy
Do you want oil?
I don't really like that idea
I was tired, so I went home
Are all the doors shut?
Are all the doors closed?
Do you want me to warm it up?
Will you go out with me?
Not a chance.
I'm listening
I'm a sentence
I'm me
I love you.
I love me too.
He's an utterly gorgeous man
Once it's spring, we'll go
You can speak, I am listening
First, we must find my brother
Speak, David
Ziri didn't approve, of course
Ziri didn't look back
Ziri stood at Rima's door
Ziri's father is dead
Ziri's house was well kept
Ziri's bedroom was spotless
These were Ziri's tear stains
Ziri's cow died from a disease
Ziri's eyes widened in horror
Where's the bridge to Canada?
Where's the Canadian border?
We can't be silent anymore
Where did you play chess?
We'll get rid of them
Use small words, please
I'm 14 and this is deep
It's interesting
Let's do it once and for all
There's no time left to lose
You got time!
Are you living with Dad?
Smiling, he bayoneted him
Someone's at the back door
Mary didn't have any secrets
I've been here
Why do they hate us?
How do you do, fellow kids?
Can't you see the problem?
It's not working.
How about now?
I can't delete the file.
How about now?
Hang out the laundry!
Is school hard?
Are you still watching this?
How did he get so much money?
Can you read this text for me?
Where's the corkscrew?
Tom Jackson's novel sold well
Tom's dream has come true
You're the stubborn one here
We'll discuss this tomorrow
I didn't read all his messages
Think, everyone!
Maybe Tom didn't eat it
Who'll operate on Tom?
It's shocking how time flies
Best ask him yourself.
Who's this letter for?
Why don't we stop for lunch?
I've sort of got used to it
We should've got up earlier
Where's my classroom?
It's on the second floor.
I'll say that
How will Tom be treated?
Why were you so worried?
It's garbage day today
We'll make a decision
My phone's memory is full
It's rubbish day today
We're starting the dictation
It's too hot!
Is imported wine also sold?
What's that kid doing here?

On the end of your nose.

You've got them on your nose.
Where are my glasses?
It's just us here
No one's here but us
We've got to move faster
They've got to move faster
You've got to move faster
Give the ball here!
We'll never manage it
May I get past, please?
Could I get by, please?
Could I come by, please?
Could I get past, please?
Could I come past, please?
May I come past, please?
Could I change them, please?
I'm thinking of getting a dog
I'm considering getting a dog
Did you really get fired?
He promised he wouldn't die
Good boy!
I'm a duck, quack
I speak English, quack
You know what happens now!
I apologize for that!
Am I being toxic?
Tom, my feet are freezing
I don't know why I like it
Don't breathe so colorfully
She wore a calf-length skirt
I'll get back to you later
Did Tom buy anything for you?
How many Kanji did you learn?
Society is unfair, isn't it?
Isn't society unfair?
Society is unfair?
Leave the tennis to me!
I will deal with the tennis!
Did you not understand me?
Was I misunderstood?
Was I not understood?
We're so far apart

Ziri's house was abandoned
Ziri didn't approach them
Ziri doesn't remember
Ziri doesn't drink
Ziri looked at me, confused
Ziri wouldn't answer

Just get over it.
I would if I could.
Just get over it.
I'm a slave
Tom can't see you guys
No, I don't have time to chat
It's a fingernail
Don't give someone fish
Do you know what Mary said?
You don't need to go very far
Who wants blood and tears?
Are you sure it's French?
What's your phone number?
Mary wore a wide-brimmed hat
Can't you hear anything?
Tatoeba is fantastic!
Tatoeba is the bomb!
What's your hobby?
Milk doesn't please me
Can you turn the fan on?
Can I take your plate?
Don't kick the cat
I don't know why I like it
Fear?
What is that?
How should these be ordered?
In what order are these?
What's the order of these?
How are you doing, Ayour ?
What's it like out there?
It's spits and spots of rain.
The sky was gin-clear
Tom's still not back
Just where is he?
Can you hear this at the back?
How did your exam go?
Didn't you hurt yourself?
My brain isn't working
What do you like about French?
Tom, say that you love me.
Wh-, what?
Say that you love me.
Why?
Just do it." "....I love you.
Thanks.
What was that all about?
Don't worry about it.

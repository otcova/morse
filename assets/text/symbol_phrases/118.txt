There's an ant in the hall
Why did you kiss me?
It's good training
I'm swamped with work

He's a world-famous writer
Perfect people don't exist
At what time did he leave?
Which team are you on?
I didn't know it was there
I'm feeling very agreeable
This isn't fun
I'm going to the store
It's open to interpretation
Tom's company went public
I wish you hadn't done that
I hope you don't do that
Why didn't you do that?
I didn't feel her presence
I've decided on going
Sorry I couldn't save you
I'd be happy if I was healthy
I think that he won't come
I've met him once before
That's a strange question
I think it's a shame

Now I remember!
You see?
It wasn't all that hard
You see?
It wasn't so hard
I didn't have time today
I'll go tomorrow
I'll be on my way, then
See you later!
I guess I'd better go, too.
We've made good progress
I'm studying in the library
I'm going to have a beer
I'm going to drink a beer
Do you think it works?
Here's a new tip for you!
It was hilarious!
Why would someone do that?
Tom's house is haunted
I'm out riding my bike
I want it for my puppy!
My son?
Now I can recall!
Let's call a spade a spade
Tom fondled Mary's breasts
It's getting ridiculous
What about your wife?
You know it's true
Tom's family is eccentric
How about some horror stories?
That dog stinks!
That animal is huge!
That cake is really tasty!
Not a word to anyone, please
Do you have a mobile phone?
What can I say?
Don't watch those shows
My present is better!
I can't visit you every day
This is a four-way stop
Wanna crash at my place?

I don't want to know about it
I can't understand the meaning
It's a done deal
I don't think he will come
Alcohol - never again!
No, no, and furthermore, no!
Have you anything to eat?
She's apples
You, too, my son
I can't find my gloves
He can't find his hat
I can't get rid of it
He doesn't care about anything
Do you require our help?
My son?
But I don't want to
I think I'll stop now
I don't want to be here
Tom doesn't watch TV
I'm glad you brought this up
It's a dog and pony show
Old age isn't pleasant
Don't close the door
I can't tell you anything yet
Why are you following me?
Do you want sugar?
Will you play go with me?
I'm a good person
Is this seat available?
I'm inconsolable
Forty-eight sailors are aboard

What is your name, sir?
Don't be nervous, Tom
Run for it, Tom!
Hey, you!
Words, words..
Today it's snowing
How are you doing for money?
He didn't listen to music
Don't mess around!
Aren't you exaggerating a bit?
He's under the thumb
He's henpecked
That girl can't ride a bicycle
Tom ponied up 100$
Did she kiss well?
Tom doesn't like to share
Tom doesn't like politics
Do you think in German?
Get real, will you?
Mary is wearing a low-cut top
There's a stowaway on the ship
I can't write anymore
That's just crazy
That's a no-brainer
It should be a no-brainer
What could go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?
It's a complete sham
That's woefully inadequate
She'll be apples
That's a cheap cop-out
That's pseudoscience
Don't fool yourself
Mary doesn't eat red meat
Who cares about that?
Don't take our word for it
Don't take my word for it
Don't take my word for it
That's quite over the top
She hasn't made it yet
He hasn't made it yet
It's one of their better songs
This is Tom's canary
Tom doesn't like eating fish
Open your mouth, please!
Yesterday, we studied English

Did you lock the door?
Did you get my letter?
Are you satisfied now?
Are you afraid of Tom?
Why are you laughing?
Where is my umbrella?
I'll ask Tom to wait
I'd like to meet Tom

Where are my books?
What station is it?
How's your brother?
How did Tom escape?
When did Tom come?
How's your father?
How do you manage?
Why are you late?
Don't disturb me
Did you call Tom?
Did anybody come?
Where's Tom now?
What did you do?
How's everybody?
Don't go there
Are you joking?
Don't rush me
Did Tom come?
Are you Tom?
We're out of tea
He's so credulous
I've got a lorry
I don't drink water
My parents won't let me date

I hate you!
I wish you were dead!
He's in hospital
She's very attractive
You, John, know many countries
What's on fire?
I'm starving!
Now I'm really tired
And what about a coffee?
Speak, please
It's not a good idea
I'm going for a walk
I'm very proud of Tom
I'm honored to work with Tom
That's useful information!
I really don't know that woman
Today, I had a lot of troubles
I'm cold
I don't like drip coffee
I don't like filter coffee
That's what's on my mind!
Do you like ice cream?
Would you like an ice cream?

Don't just eat fish
Eat meat, too
In which direction did he go?
I work in a chemist's
Don't go over the speed limit
What wonderful weather!
He cried like a six-year-old
Do you want some fruit juice?
How are you?
Which shoes do you like?
My telephone doesn't work
There's a lot of fruit
Clear the area, please
I don't even know who she is
Do you want some beer?
Oh crumbs!
It is blue.
A cousin is my uncle's son

You don't work in an office
I'll call her immediately
I'd like to go, too
Do you want a ticket?
She would be proud of me!
Spanish words sound sandy..
It feels unnatural for them..
Did that really happen to him?
Do you understand this book?
Are you an animist?
I don't know where you will go
They took me!
Don't bug me
Pull yourself together!
It's an embarrassing illness
They're analyzing the samples
Come on, let's go up!
Who killed her?
It's a nice seaside town
I'm not for spoiling pets
He didn't have any accomplice
Here we are, right?
Luisma is stupid, isnt' he?
There's no more ointment
Sunday's match will be crucial
It's a daydream attack
He believes he's gonna stay
Nothing's easy
He's in the fourth year
Can you fire a nation?
Why worry so much?
We'll sleep embraced
It's gonna be a challenge
Which one do you like better?
Do you like to travel?

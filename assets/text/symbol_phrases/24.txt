It's twenty past three
It's 3.20
It's quarter to five
It's a quarter to five
It's 4.45
He's the building's caretaker
It's now quarter to nine
It's now 8.45
What should I do?
Tom didn't come to my house
I'll order three pizzas
Let's do this tomorrow
Tom can't come either
Let me ask you something, Tom
I'm happy when you're happy
Was Tom wearing a jacket?
There are only red ones left.
Ziri's eyes went teary
Ignore him.
How large is Boston?
The population was 18,432
The bat can't dive that fast
How do you spell this word?
Mary's husband is Canadian
I can't wear this
Maybe Tom won't come
I'm beginning to realize that
That's an offensive word
Let's stop talking about Tom
Tom is John's bodyguard
I'm hungry, and so is Tom
The moon isn't hollow, Tom
I didn't want to hurt anyone
Was there anybody in the cave?
I don't think it will.
I'm a small-town kind of guy
Tom wasn't hallucinating
Has the concert begun yet?
It's at five o'clock
Ziri took away Rima's plate
I admire Tom's talent
Ziri came up to Rima's table
I'm taking him away
Let's learn Kadazan language
Mary isn't as pretty as I am
Is it dark outside?
You're off your head
So true, bestie!
Do what's best
Tom wasn't working very hard
Tom isn't a police officer
They're fresh out of the oven
Don't sit on the settee
It's 10.52
I wouldn't dream of it
She didn't mince her words
He's a very changeable person
We're all quite shattered
We're all quite exhausted
If that works, I'll eat my hat
I'm listening to music
What about you?
Hasn't anyone got a question?
Does no one have a question?
I won't keep you waiting
Which flat does he live in?
Would you like a pint?
I'll ask Tom to help us
Yes, he lives here
I live in my uncle's house now
Tom wasn't much of a drinker
I'm very happy to come
It can be very eye-opening
I'm feeling better every day
What happened to her face?
I swear that's true
So mean!
It's time to let go
That isn't normal, is it?
With that, Ziri walked off
Why do you need Tom?
Do you want to eat out today?
The car sold for $12,469
I'd like a glass of cold water
I never thought I'd get caught
Learn Magyar!
Speak Magyar!
I'm Magyar
He's Magyar
She's Hungarian
She's Magyar
Are you Magyar?
Are you a Magyar person?
Are you Magyar people?
We're Magyars
We're Magyar people
I'm not Magyar
I'm definitely not a Hungarian
Do you speak Magyar?
Do you understand Magyar?
Does he understand Magyar?
Does she understand Magyar?
Can he understand Hungarian?
Can she understand Hungarian?
Can he understand Magyar?
Can she understand Magyar?
Say it in Magyar!
I'm learning Magyar
Say this in Magyar!
Say this in Hungarian!
Let's learn Magyar
Do they speak Magyar?
Were you born in October?
Is it over?
It's never over.
Are you ready?
I was born ready.
Tom?
Are you with us?
I've got spoons of all sizes
That's enough sugar for today
We didn't steal it!
We won it fair and square!
I'm ready to try doing that
I don't have any pockets
Would this match?
Come downstairs, Tom
I'm a little bit in hot water
Tom wasn't an architect
Let's get this started, guys
I'm just going into town now
Tom couldn't find his bag
Ziri's mother was so caught up
Now, now
I'll have a cappuccino, please
Ziri walked around, frowning
I think that's what Tom meant
Who needs grammar anyway?
Don't bump into anything
I'm following my destiny
Well, it's a long list
Ziri's mom was called in
Just then, Ziri spoke up
He should be suspended!
Now you're all grown up
Do you want free books?
Well, hurry over!
Ziri sneaked into Rima's room
Suddenly, Ziri came in
I don't like this cap
Tom couldn't be found anywhere
I didn't believe that
I should've listened to my dad
Will Erdogan give up on Putin?
I'm still doing my homework
Cuba introduced the 3G service
Kosovo isn't a real country
How do things stand right now?
Tom isn't going to play tennis
I don't often use these
It is now 4.15
It's now 4.15
It's now quarter past four
I passed my exam.
I'm glad to hear that!
Why didn't you ring us?
What?
What biscuit barrel?
At first, I was sceptical
To begin with, I was sceptical
To start with, I was sceptical
Initially, I was sceptical
She's at the doctors
She's seeing the doctor
It was 5.30 a.m
Outside, it was still dark
Mum, I need the loo!
Hold on a bit longer, Tom
A quarter past three is 3.15
If you agree, say yes
Tom didn't have a penny
Don't you like being praised?
Don't you like to be praised?
I'm older and wiser now
So, the search continues.
We're never bored
Is the microphone switched on?
Even so, there are risks
I don't think Tom will show up
That's daylight robbery!
I'll miss him.
We'll all miss him
He was a special person.
Get up, sleepyhead!
It's 6.30!
Get up, sleepyhead!
It's half six!
No, can't
What's that thing on the wall?
It's a surveillance camera.
Shall I drive?
I'm sorry about that time
That's my neighbor's car
That car is our neighbor's
It's unique
It's nice
Don't tell me you can't
Tell me you don't want to
Where's the calendar?
After all, he rejects you
Why do you think I will die?
To be honest, I was happy
I know you don't need me
Don't put things here
No, I can't do that
Has Tom paid you?
I'll go home by cab
I'll go home by taxi
Don't you know how to read?
Don't you know what to read?
Could you hold this for me?
Could you hold my purse?
Breaking news: the cow calved!
I'm getting married tomorrow
Tom isn't a blacksmith
How many cats is too many?
Tom is John's landlord
Here, show me your report card
Is Bob OK?
No, that's impossible
Did Tom help Mary?
I've seen this image before
I'm getting the hang of it
Getting old is great!
I'm going to medical school
Have you finished your task?
Almost.
I never thought you'd do that
I'm really excited about it
We've been really busy today
I don't know why you did that
It's a trip I'll never forget
Let me tell you why I'm here
What type of book is it?
An autobiography.
I'm very good at math
We won't give up hope
Ziri's Berber is a lot better
Ziri's Berber is so bad
What is he doing here?
Can I say it in Berber?
Ziri didn't live in Algeria
That’s too complicated for me
Tom hasn't yet seen the list
That's not the way I'd do that
Berber has changed Ziri's life
Don't do that in Algeria
Ziri can practice Berber 24/7
It's a little windy in Algiers
Ziri's Berber course is online
Let's learn to speak Berber
Ziri's Berber sounds natural
Did Ziri speak in Berber?
Why did he speak in Berber?
I feel safe when I'm with you
It's not that cheap
Close the door behind you.
Screw the door.
I didn't try the corn
And now you're screaming!
Do you think that it'll rain?
Suddenly, Ziri barged in
NATO doesn't play.
Ziri is ugly.
What can he do about it?
He didn't create himself.
Rima missed Ziri's meat
Rima missed Ziri's meat.
What do you mean?
Forget it.
Why is Ziri mad at Rima?
Don't hate me for my mom
I don't have any Shawi dress.
Well, that's why I am here
Let's go shopping for one.
I'm at a lack of words
Can you guys come?
Stop fighting, you guys!
That's all you care about.
That's where we ate lunch
I don't like this cup
What is the name of this tool?
Tom can't open the box
Wait, please
Sounds good!
Can you make some coffee?
I've seen them theorise
Tom's door was shut
This is a picture of Tom's dog
I'm not touching your feet
Get off me, you little pig!
Ziri handed Rima 4000 dinars
Is speaking Berber hard?
Tom wasn't brave
Just one more thing..
Do you want to?
I know it's not right
I know it's incorrect
I'd rather be a carpenter
I told Tom what I'd done
I told Tom who I'd talked to
How many days is your holiday?
Is Tom supposed to do that?
I've just met him!
Now I know!
It's guaranteed to go badly
Betty didn't say a single word
You're lucky he didn't bite
You're on the wrong track
You're on the wrong path
What colour are your eyes?
Steel grey.
Was that question rhetorical?
That's why I don't want to go
Perhaps Tom won't come
Are Tom and Mary a couple?
You don't have to feel guilty
You don't need to feel guilty
Tom was in his mid-thirties
Is Tom diabetic?
Tom's team lost
That was an eye-opener
I'll shine your shoes for you
I really don't care who wins
This is a fool's errand
I don't care what Tom thinks?
I don't care what Tom does?
I don't care what Tom says?
How many days do you need?
How many brooms do you need?
Why wasn't Tom happy?
It's a cat
Poor guy, they massacred him!
This isn't hype
I'm turning thirty next month
I'd never want to do that
Tom isn't well-educated
I've never worn this jacket
Don't leave me now
I'll ask Tom about that
Let me ask you something, Tom
I didn't expect to be paid
Which one is my toothbrush?
Do you believe it's true?
I admit that I'm an alcoholic
It's already linked
They've poisoned us
What's to be done?
I can't bear this pain anymore
Why don't you take a day off?
I've only had one drink
Tom isn't big on commitment
Do I have to stay here?
Do I need to return?
It's really hard to describe
I don't know who's using it
It's not that cheap now
You don't need to go see it
I don't use the timer function
Are you from Moscow?
It's very exciting, isn't it?
Don't ask that!
Do you have enough free time?
What am I doing in this mess?
And fuck NATO, by the way
Fuck NATO.
Shut up!
What was Tom really doing?
NATO's decline has begun.
You're pathetic
Simplistic statements?
Ziri isn't speaking in riddles
He's only here to stir shit up
I know it isn't right
They can't have fired Tom
Tom's heart stopped
I'm terribly afraid of them
I bought a one-way ticket
I didn't buy anything for Tom
He doesn't deserve it
Who is Tahmid?
I don’t know any Tahmid
This is Tahmid's house
They couldn't track down Tom
Why do you lock the door?
Yours always, Mary
Why is everyone so calm?
How long will you be staying?
A couple of weeks or so.
How long are you staying?
About a fortnight.
How long are you staying?
A couple of weeks or so.
Fish can't live outside water
I'm standing outside the house
Do you come from England?
What's your favourite song?
There'll be drought everywhere
We're ill and bedridden
We're ill and in bed
We're ill in bed
I won't keep you any longer
I'm not signing them
Why do you ring me so late?
Why do you phone me so late?
Is the sky blue?
Yes.
Open the windows, will you?
You should've noticed me
We haven't got time for that
We haven't got time for that!
I'm fed up with hearing that
Is that a cash machine?
That's a really catchy tune
Tom likes what he's doing
Is there a campsite near here?
I don't care where we go
He's absorbed in his studies
He couldn't wait to fly home
Do you have allies?
I'm in pain all the time
Tom's cat is dying
Deal!
Mom has passed away.
Who knows?
Maybe I am.
Tom didn't say why he resigned
Are you trying to sneak out?
You're grounded!
It doesn't matter
I was born grounded!
Was Tom's room clean or dirty?
Tom doesn't hate anybody
I don't know when Tom arrived
Do you want to be my wife?
It's time you left
I'm turning thirty in a month
Why do dogs smell like that?
We'll never forget her
Why does Tom smell like that?
We'll never forget him
You'll never forget that
He can't forget that
She can't forget that
They can't forget that
Aren't you going to answer?
Sorry, I can't see
I've lost my glasses
Didn't I work?
Call the nurse!
What can you suggest?
She was 13 years old
Good morning, friends!
You'd better go to hospital
Please don't be unkind
Do I need to change for Paris?
Don't be unkind
Oi, mate!
Don't make so much noise
I've got Maths homework today
Where can I find a bakery?
You haven't practised enough
You didn't practise enough
It's too dark to read
I've opened the door wide
Can I ring later?
Can I phone later?
Do you want to ring someone?
Do you want to phone someone?
What did you open them with?
What did you use to open it?
What did you use to open them?
I'll ring as soon as I know
I'll phone as soon as I know
He's an analyst now
Have you been awake for long?
I've got to change at Hamburg
Can you let me know tomorrow?
Did you recognise him?
Who was it?
One of our classmates.
Really?
Was it Matt?
No, Nick.
We've drunk all our water
In Boston.
I don't care.
In Boston.
I don't care.
Nerd!
Ziri's parents fell asleep
He's repeating the year.
I'm tutoring her.
I feel like I'm being used
It didn't snow much last year
I was asleep, then I woke up
That's a big puppy.
He's a Boxer.
Hot enough for you?
Tom doesn't golf
You're thinking of Mary
He couldn't bear the shame
What are your weak points?
Why do leaves change color?
Someone's chainsawing
Where can I get this repaired?
You don't make orders here
I'll be very busy this weekend
No.
What does it depend on?
Can you read this small print?
I'm calling Thomas
Would you mind if I used this?
I'm going to go up there
Tom isn't as rich as you think
It's an ancient legend
I'll keep looking for stuff
That's the wildcard
I'll let you use my lawnmower
He's a good dog
We've been kind of busy today
Tom couldn't find the exit
Don't take me to the hospital
What have you decided to do?
Could the USSR have survived?
I'm trying to be sincere
I know it's already too late
I'm happy today!
Why?
I don't bleed from my nose
Ziri’s parents split up
Ziri’s family fell apart
He can't see well
Ziri sneaked into Rima’s room
I think that it's intended
I think that it's deliberate
It's not always a party
You have class tomorrow?
It's politics
Tom didn't accept gifts
Are you happy to come back?
It happened in the 80's
It's a pity he couldn't come
How did you already know that?
She gained 50 kilos
Get it out quickly!
Get it out!
Do you drink barley tea?
Do you drink wheat tea?
Will you drink wheat tea?
Will you drink barley tea?
Thanks for the help!
Tom is John's little brother
Tom is John's big brother
Well it's ok!
That's alright, no problem!
Ok, ok!
Alright!
It's not as bad right now
That isn't a tumor
If you say a word, you're dead
But who are you?
Tom is Mary's big brother
This isn't you, Tom
That guy over there isn't Tom
Tom wasn't the one who told me
Done!
I'm not unfriendly
I'm shy
Let's enjoy the moment
Ask Tom where he's going
What made you say yes?
Did you have a good holiday?
Tom wouldn't dare
That's kind of weird
What if you go instead of me?
Take it easy, and think
Aren't you happy together?
Aren't they happy together?
He's just a businessman
It'll be better than before
That's not suspicious at all
They're interested in politics
Tom has a son, doesn't he?
Do you want a bath?
Do you want to bathe?
Will you bathe?
Will you decide to bathe?
Will you decide on a bath?
Do you want a meal?
It's buggy
It's a bug
Okay, let's do it
When can I meet?
Can Tom play the trumpet?
It appears self-serving
Let's go to bed already
I got home before 2:30
May I have spaghetti?
Is spaghetti OK?
I'll do it starting tomorrow
Just shut up, OK?
Ziri didn’t turn around
Would you like some spaghetti?
Let's make spaghetti for lunch
Is that your girlfriend?
Yeah.
Tell her to come over.
Are you Ziri's girlfriend?
Yeah.
Come closer, I don't bite.
That's disco
My dad.
That's a neat mushroom
We couldn't take Tom with us
Don't throw it over the fence
He's a made man
I'll defer to your expertise
I'll defer to your judgment
What did you say?
Could you repeat it?
Anything else you want to say?
I'm saving the most I can
The planet isn't fine
Hi, I'm Tom
And you?
No, that's all, thank you
I know it's my own fault
Help me, and I will help Tom
What else can we do for Tom?
Maybe I'll just wear jeans
You don't have to get it
Quiet, Tom
It's a common expression
We've been waiting patiently
Whatever you say, buddy
These aren't the same
I've been to your house
Help me, and I'll help Tom
Whose umbrellas are these?
I'm going back home next week
What advice did you get?
You don't know Tom
What was Tom ranting about?
That's going to be hard
I don't want to die.
You're not going to die.
Are you writing short stories?
Tom is shy, too
Oi, mate!
The number of reception is 1
I reckon it's about to rain.
I do as well.
It's scratched
It's too dear for me
That's the way of the world
I've written a new song
I wish I hadn't heard that
I wish this hadn't happened
You used to like apples.
I used to, but not any more.
Have a good day, everyone
I'm sorry
You again?
What?
Ziri didn't even let Rima in
Ziri tore off Rima's wig
Ah, Ziri!
Come in, come in, dear!
I'll pay you all you want
Just let me go.
Do you think I'm poor?
Did you not hurt yourself?
It's useless to talk to her
She doesn't listen to you
How old are you in fact?
Can I use a credit card here?
Who's the new teacher?
Did the rules change?
Are the rules different now?
Is there really nothing left?
How may I help you today?
How may we help you today?
It didn't matter what happened
We'll go next time
I should've done it sooner
I should've changed it earlier
I should've done it that way
It wasn't funny, but I laughed
Let's stick together
Does Toki Pona stand a chance?
I'm not tense
Tom's pace slackened
I'm no leader
Everybody, get up and dance
Can you sleep in such danger?
Don't expect a miracle
Don't expect that to happen
Tom likes Mary's cooking
God forbid!
I hope it doesn't come to that
Where can I get this fixed?
I'm Tom's coach
We're eating dinner now
I'm eating dinner right now
Right now, we're eating dinner
This is Tom's mom, Mary
Right now, I'm eating dinner
I'm Mary, Tom's mom
I'm bored of your language
Could you ask Tom?
I wasn't at all hungry
I wasn't so hungry
I wasn't all that hungry
Thank you, my darling
May I borrow your wheelbarrow?
Bah!
Who!
When do you need my answer?
When is the deadline?
I don't usually carry a purse
Tom can't fix this
I'm on board
Let's meet for lunch
Tom will decide who'll do that
Will you please hurry?
Are you sure you don't care?
Don't leave your books here
There's someplace I have to go
Don't get angry, OK?
How is Tom's condition?
I don't think this is edible
Don't ask for too much
I feel that way, too
Where was Tom taken?
We're looking for evidence
We're searching for clues
I can't do it that way
That's very pretty, isn't it?
Can I have another helping?
You're overthinking things
OK, let's do it
That shouldn't have been done
That won't be successful
That won't succeed
It won't succeed
You've never bored me
Is Tom a diabetic?
Let Tom eat, please
Did Tom agree?
Which half do you want?
Which instance is it?
Go for it!
Jump!
I'm up for it
How's your headache?
Tom stayed 688 sols on Mars
I didn't remember Tom
If I had time, I'd help you
I know about Tom's troubles
I don't know
You're spoiling Tom
I know it isn't true
Say it isn't so
Hey, come on!
Let me out!
Hey, come on!
Open up!
Hey, come on!
This is not funny!
Ziri won't be kicked out
It's me!
Why don't you just drop out?
You know what I found out?
I'm not nice
You shouldn't be here, Tom
What good is it to you?
Ziri's classmates came in
Ziri read Rima's note out loud
Ziri's whole face swelled up
Soon, Ziri and Rima made up
I knew they wouldn't forget me
Thanks, mate
Which train goes to Paris?
Is there a lift for guests?
He's getting into the lift
He's going into the lift
Did you go there by car?
Mary wears a size 37 in shoes
Did you really?
Tom didn't do well in the exam
A blue one.
He's as straight as an arrow
When is the due date?
Did you hear that, Rachel?
They're very funny
That was really stupid of you!
That was really stupid of you!
No, thank you
I'll eat something at home.
Did you send her my message?
Where is the nearest clinic?
Did you see him yet?
Can I join you for dinner?
Don't worry about the bill
I'll cover it
Who should be blamed here?
Who is to blame here?
I'm only following orders
Is anyone hungry?
Is anybody hungry?
It's been one week
That dog's got me wiped out
Why don't you go and rest now?
They're both studying abroad
I fact-checked Tom
It's a dog!
Don't worry about it
Just go find him already!
It's very quiet there at night
I don't need any help from you
They have two sons, both twins
I'm done washing my hands
You goblin bastards!
Come and get me if you dare!
What is causing this?
I replied "blue.
He said, "I love blue too!
Is there a problem?
Yes, my soup has a fly in it!
I'm fine, sir
That's a great message
I don't like the redesign
Most people aren't like that
It's very frustrating to see
That's a real problem
They've been talking about it
What is taking you so long?
I promise you I'll change
Why wouldn't he do that again?
I don't think I was there
He's gay for pay
Ziri stole Rima's baby
King Ziri defeated Rima's army
I'm slipping
Ziri defected to Rima's side
Is Tom happy now?
Tom's audacity is enormous
Let's try again tomorrow
Let's plant trees
Keep calm, everybody
It's only a baby dragon
Stop being so pathetic!
Quit being so pathetic!
Why is Tom so mad at Mary?
Can you start over?
It's difficult to describe it
I'm the bait
You could record Tom's voice
Give me tofu!
What is the computer saying?
Cheers!
Tom lives in a housing co-op
I knew that I'd find you here
I fact-checked Tom on the spot
I think that it's not good
You don't have a peace of mind
Born in the 21st century!
Don't even dare to wake Tom up
We won't take it anymore
I got to go do something.
Shall we order more cake?
It'll be a couple of months
We're going to take your guns
Did we pass the exit?
I'll go ahead and set it down
I'm a customer
Do you want Chinese?
Do you want Chinese food?
We're a long way away
I'm actually not a cat
We're in a construction zone
Alright, dude
We're on the highway
I've already used all my leave
That'll constipate you
It's flattering
You can't drink in the park
Boo!
I'm a new man
What makes a flame blue?
There's no steak there
It's a vegan restaurant
I'm here, Tom
I'm a pirate
I hope you'll let me stay
Not at all.
Nobody believed Tom's story
No one believed Tom's story
Let's give them a wash
Tom's cat is healthy
Where do gulls nest?
What make is your mobile?
You could've at least rung us
Does she rest a bit ?
I'm not messy
What does a good CV look like?
Her anger wasn't play-acting
Is Tom still the caretaker?
Will the box fit in the van?
It's happy hour again
I'm traveling
Which hoover is the best?
What if he really is ill?
He's opened another bottle
He was caught drink-driving
I've always sort of liked Tom
We're going to the football
We're going to the museum
Is it worth learning Berber?
I didn't know what day it was
Is learning Berber stressful?
I saw her...
Yes, carry on.
I ... saw her...
Yes?
I saw...
Why are you crying?
You're planning too much
Ziri doesn't know Berber well
Are you nervous?
Yes, very.
Ziri hurried to Rima's aid
Yes, that's right!
What do you mean?
You shouldn't even move.
Ziri won't spy on Rima anymore
Somehow, Ziri found out
Ziri talked Rima's ear off
Stop moping around!
I'm going to ask Tom
Ziri isn't looking for Rima
Stop playing with words!
I wish I'd stayed
A seagull stole my hamburger!
I'll still love you
Don't pigeonhole me!
I'm no coward
Has something gone wrong?
For once, Tom was right
For once, Tom is right
I refuse to eat fish!
We don't need to do this now
Let's take a short break here
It won't be a problem at all
I'll carry that luggage
I'll do that job
I'll do nothing
Don't bully people
I'm ashamed of Tom
I'm your son
The Cold War isn't over
Zelensky's tears were in vain
I'm terrible
Ziri is a Russian agent.
Satisfied?
I don't need you here, Tom
Are you breaking up with me?
Where is my daughter?
I wish I could be with you.
You're with me.
What do you mean?
Turn around.
Ziri walked away, laughing
Ziri stepped forward, laughing
Ziri is the son of a convict.
I'm ending it
You didn't miss anything
I know I'll never forget this
Tom is at home, safe and sound
Did he pay?
I'm fine here
I'm on to Tom
Tom took Mary's seat
Tom isn't really shy
I'm a sheriff
Let me finish, Tom
I'm Dr. Jackson
A bit early, isn't it?
Why isn't there nothing?

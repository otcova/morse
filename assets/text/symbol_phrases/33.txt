I got a tan.
Sure, a farmer's tan.
That's fine with me.
Do you have a washing machine?
We're finally at the airport
I don't believe he did it
Fuck the Queen!
No one's picking up
She won't kill herself
You'll be a wonderful mother
You can't save everybody
What I told you was a lie!
Who are you, boy?
Qui êtes vous maintenant ?
Is this a one or a seven?
Are these your labels?
It is breaktime!
I can't find him
Are you sure he's here?
What time are you leaving?
At eight o'clock.

Let them go to hell!
Shall we give it a go?
Of course!
What have we got to lose?
Hello, Jack!
Is Anna there?
Yeah, come in
She's in the living room.
Can we visit Tom?
I was set up!
Tom's story makes zero sense
Am I a good boy?
I'm sure we'll make it on time
I'm still not myself
I'm still not quite myself
It's secular
Yidir's wife is pregnent
This is a Western world!
The West isn't using diplomacy
The US is trash-talking China
We Westerners run the world!
Not anymore.
How dare China rise?
This is our world!
This is our century!
Then try and stop China.
What's Netanyahu planning?
Fire at will!

Have you got any eggs?
You've got to press the button
Where that girl is going to?
Don't mislead people
You're pushing yourself down
What are your top priorities?
Don't break your commitments
Don't be hard on yourself
I'm glad to connect with you
Tom's paintings were burned
I regret that I didn't do it
It's sickening to me
Read Jordan Peterson's books
You’ve got some balls!
Do you like soccer?
No, I hate it!
Why are you here?
I haven't forgotten the past
Did you see the fire?
Don't work
What a waste!
Look!
These are your brothers!
Geez, overdramatic much?
Swear you won't tell anyone
Guess what?
I've got into university!
Guess what?
I've got a place at uni!
She's my joy
It's your duty as a son
I'm staying with you guys
Is this mine or yours?
Tom's a good fellow
Still want a quilt?
It's made up
It's purely online
I don't like dirty animals
We'll meet in my office
Until then, please wait here
As a child, he loved to swim
Hey!
Watch what you're doing!
Follow the white rabbit.
What for?
The stone talks to me.
You are stoned.
You'll be working in groups
You'll work in groups
Why were you always alone?
Careful!
Don't run over the cat!
I've forgotten my PIN
Have you ever climbed Mt Fuji?
Have you been to the canteen?
Today, it is lunch with meat
Why you are so late?
Why isn't dinner ready yet?
I'll be staying at Tom's place
You can't make me do this
No one's answering the phone
You might've gotten killed
You might've been killed
It's important to be polite
You should've been more polite
You could've called me
Should I add some more salt?
I'm glad the windows are open
We swam out to Tom's yacht
I don't get angry very often
Tom's painting was burned
How did you get these tickets?
Algiers is Ziri's hometown
I don't put sex first
You're constantly on my mind
To me, you are everything
I'm cisgender
I'm not very good at these
Women no longer exist?
Women don't exist.
Women exist.
Men and women exist.
I'm a woman.
And I'm a dinosaur!
My wife is a woman.
That's transphobic to say!
Don't be silenced by wokeism
Is science transphobic?
You're a dinosaur!
You're going blind with rage
Ziri left Algiers in 2004
Are you Algerian?
I'm Algerian.
Keep it Algerian!

In Algiers, traffic is bad
It's sunny in Algiers
Algeria has 58 provinces

Ideas don't die.
As it stands, my life is ideal
How did Ziri find Islam?
How did Ziri convert to Islam?
Islam's holy book is the Quran
Was Jesus the son of God?
Ziri was very anti-Muslim
Are Muslims inherently bad?
He doesn't fit in society
He can't adapt to society
Love, as they say, is blind
He's a thoughtful individual
It wasn't his fault
It wasn't her fault
Why are you laughing, Tom?
We haven't wasted any time
We didn't waste any time
We've wasted no time
He's a profound man
They'll ignore it
They'll turn a deaf ear
I'm not doing them any favors
I'm not doing them any favours
In life, exams never end
Thank you very much, I am full
But he can't do it
Angels do exist, in my opinion
I'm in the midst of a crisis
The sun isn't shining today
Me ogre!
Me club big club, bam!
He's not very smart, is he?
Well, how's your Ogrish?
What should I do?
Just grant it authorization.
I'm red-green colorblind
My calendar is jam-packed
Whose fault is it, then?
Oh, how fun!
Where are those I know?
What do you want from me now?
I dialled 911
He dialled 911

May I sleep outside?
If you touch me, I'll scream
Oh no, there's not enough time
What's the problem?
Well, no help for it.
Oh, sorry, I'll read them now.
What?
Cockroach on a firework stick.
Let's go to the bar
What time is the social?
Haha, made you look twice!
Is it a queer bar?
I'm a banana
How's her name spelled?
How do you spell her name?
I was wrong from the get-go
He's right, you know
I didn't see the mailman
There's no perfect crime
I can't with her
Has the bus already gone?
It's just left.
There's no metro in my city
We're learning new vocabulary
It is hot!
It is boiling, I am sweating
I don't want to appear boring
How do you get to this answer?
Am I going to be fine?
Did you see the email?
Most people don't get my joke

Tom didn't confess to it
I've always craved caffeine
Who wants to catch you?
It's very smooth
We're both Jewish
We're both Canadian
I've travelled much for work
Just now, he's in the shower
Give me your coat, please
I wonder who is he?

Ziri and Rima speed-walked
Rima and Skura speed-walked
We speed-walked
They speed-walked
Did you hear screaming?
Ziri's job is the hardest
What's so hard about that
Let's go in and rest
Are you sure you'll be alright
Isn't the weather nice today?
Could you please just go?
Ziri's bus is here
Can you call Ziri?
Can you fart like Ziri?
What was that, a fart?
Ziri scared Mina's baby
Do you mind keeping quiet?
Is everyone alright?
You shouldn't stop so suddenly
Is the store still far?
We've already passed it.
How was work today, honey?
I'm in a bit of a hurry
Mina became a nurse's aid
Mina gave birth to Ziri's baby
I'm glad you asked
Ziri met Rima in mid-April
Ziri can't stop this this time
Ziri couldn't speak
Did Ziri see anything?
Ziri may have seen it, too
Ziri didn't find that funny
Ziri wasn't scared by anything
It's an art not to panic
Ziri's noise attracted a bear
Ziri's story is short
This happened in April of 2004
Ziri is a nature-loving person
Ziri wasn't moving an inch
Ziri didn't pay any mind of it
Ziri shouldn't cry
Ziri didn't even know that guy
It's very nice out
Ziri couldn't find anything
Ziri's dog is vocal
Ziri follows Rima's blog
Ziri's heart was in his throat
Ziri's heart was frozen
Ziri's dogs lost the scent
Ziri's dog might be missing
This isn't always the case
Ziri hasn't returned home
It wouldn't have been unusual
This never crossed Ziri's mind
Ziri found Rima's canteen
Is Ziri safe to deal with?
Ziri wasn't able to deny that
Slowly, Ziri pressed ahead
Ziri did search-and-rescue
This will change Ziri's life
Ziri probably didn't make it
I don't need your presence
You aren't welcome in my life
It still doesn't feel real
Ziri is a full-fledged adult
Ziri can't take it anymore
Don't even try to touch me
Are you Ziri?
What's the time?
It's early afternoon.
Who's Rima?
She's Ziri's girlfriend.
Don't eat the fruits
Don't eat the fruits at all
I don't want you here with me
What if it's poisonous?
Ziri doesn't have an old man
Ziri's offer is tempting
Ziri knows Rima's true name
Islam changed Ziri's life
It doesn't need a label
We don't need to label it
I'll leave him a tip
Now, night falls early
Fancy getting a bite to eat?
Tom hasn't told anybody yet
What do you mean by that?
I've come down with the flu
He's a very pleasant person
I've got a new plan
I'll go and get my car
Someone's just rung
Why didn't you ring?
Why haven't you rung?
Why didn't you phone?
Why haven't you phoned?
Why didn't you just ring?
Why didn't you just phone?
Why didn't you ring us?
Why didn't you phone us?
Have you rung her yet?
Have you phoned her yet?
Have you rung him yet?
Have you phoned him yet?
You'll need a torch
You'll need it
There's just been an accident
I wonder why Tom's skint
I'm really bored
Cyan is a greenish-blue colour
Did you ring me last night?
Did you phone me last night?
I thought I'd got over you
Where's the nearest chemist?
Where's the nearest chemist's?
They're both really brilliant
I'll have to ring you back
I'll have to phone you back
What language do you like?
They're on his trail
For example, how to socialize
I'm very cold now
I've improved my results
I eat lunch at one-thirty
I'm not even sure why I'm here
Could you keep me abreast?
Tom doesn't have any weapons
We don't have any weapons
Their house isn't like ours
He doesn’t deserve you
He isn’t worthy of you
This isn't her first time
She doesn't like kids
Where are the sandwiches?
Why did you steal my butter?
Let's talk about it in person
Oh!
I have a calendar too!
I'm not wearing any clothes
I don't want a lot
It's growing louder
It's getting louder and louder
I'm not homeless anymore
So, what are we, exactly?
I'm not asking you
I'm asking Tom
Dinner's just about ready
I can't find my book anywhere
I'm feeling unappreciated
You must've misunderstood me
The food's always good here
She's somewhere about
Did you feel followed?
I only read non-fiction
That's why I didn't stay
Did you feel uneasy?
Did you hear jackals?
Did you sleep better?
Did you dissect frogs?
Do you go fishing?
You're alone
Did you attend college?
Above all, stay calm!
You weren't sure
She wasn't sure
Rima wasn't sure
Ziri and Rima weren't sure
Rima and Skura weren't sure
We weren't sure
They weren't sure
Did you see a wolf?
Did you have a crowbar?
You didn't reply
Rima didn't reply
Ziri and Rima didn't reply
Rima and Skura didn't reply
We didn't reply
They didn't reply
I was short-haired
You were short-haired
He was short-haired
She was short-haired
Rima was short-haired
We were short-haired
They were short-haired
Did you write a letter?
Stop babbling nonsense!
You weren't right
She wasn't right
Quit making up stories!
Rima wasn't right
Ziri and Rima weren't right
Rima and Skura weren't right
We weren't right
They weren't right
She's trying hard
We're trying hard
They're trying hard
Did you dial the number?
She couldn't move
Rima couldn't move
Ziri and Rima couldn't move
We wouldn't move
They couldn't move
Stop poking around!
Where's her father?
Did you pick up Mina?
The pizza's here
Did you call Mina again?
Did you enter the highway?
Do you have an iguana?
He's wasting time
She's wasting time
I'm filthy rich
He's filthy rich
She's filthy rich
You're filthy rich
We're filthy rich
They're filthy rich
I'm severely injured
He's severely injured
She's severely injured
We're severely injured
They're severely injured
Did you live with Mina?
Did you talk about Mina?
Did you change your name?
Did you change your names?
Were you working there?
Rima and Skura got the message
Did you pay the check?
Did you make the burgers?
Did you heat the food?
Did you go to check?
Did you take a dump?
Did you identify your shooter?
Ziri couldn't believe that
Ziri is Rima's grandfather
Ziri refered to Rima's mother
Ziri isn't fully sane
What haunts this forest?
Now let's begin
Ziri was Rima's pursuer
Ziri heard children's laughter
Ziri stood there, perplexed
Ziri didn't have a clue
Ziri stood there, confused
Ziri watched, confused
It's gone now
Ziri didn't see what it was
It was as if I wasn't alone
Ziri couldn't understand that
Ziri's mother passed away
Ziri felt it, too
Ziri followed Rima's gaze
Ziri ran towards Rima's house
Ziri couldn't see or hear us
Ziri didn't get much sleep
Ziri stopped and didn't move
It's not over there anymore
Ziri's mind was blown
Ziri is our family's patriarch
Rest well, Ziri
Ziri's cabin isn't for sale
Ziri's dogs barked at Rima
Stray dogs are Ziri's corpse
Ziri wasn't angry at all
Are you lost?
Ziri's dog is more brutal
Ziri's dog is taller
Ziri's dog is skinny
Ziri's dog is very territorial
Ziri's dog is stubborn
Ziri's dog is vicious
Ziri's dog is white
Ziri's dog is black
Ziri's dog is a fighter
Ziri can't own guns in Algeria
Ziri's dog is tough
Ziri's dog is loyal to him
Ziri took Rima's dog
Ziri's dog is very strong
Ziri isn't home yet
It looked like a fox's leg
Ziri named his dog "Bingo.
Ziri's face was gone
You're the reason I live
Could you not touch my things?
She's taking her bra off
She's taking off her bra
The war began in 1941
Ziri's dog has begun growling
Ziri's parents were here
Ziri's toughest dog died
Please Ziri, don't touch me
Why?
It feels like incest.
Ziri climbed into Rima's car
Ziri found Rima's black Ford
Tom doesn't study on Sundays
Did she accept my offer?
I didn't understand a word
Let's have dinner!
I don't want to be this way
Oh, do they now?
So I've heard.
Your cheek's bleeding!
What happened?
Well, my shaver broke!
Would you check the tyres?
I heard it got canceled.
We've just landed
I'm not angry any more
I'm not cross any more
I'd like to book a single room
I rang him, but it was engaged
I'd rather go out than stay in
What's got into her?
What has got into her?
I've never skived school
I've never bunked off school
We won't be getting married
We're not going to get married
This street is a cul-de-sac
I'm desperate to fall in love
I sat on the bed's edge
You're ill
They're ill
Is this all that's left?
I dare you!
Look what I've found!
A piece of amber!
It's in her book
It's written in her book
It's in his book
It's written in his book
Then do it!
They're sick
What was the question again?
You've never even said sorry
He looks like a sixty-year-old
What's funny?
What do you find funny?

Daily, my love for you grows
Ziri's story freaked Rima out
Ziri was a first-time camper
Ziri sat in his tent, frozen
Ziri didn't try anything
Ziri wasn't found at all
Ziri wouldn't find Rima
It was Ziri's turn to seek
Ziri can't cheat
Ziri's blood began to run cold
What are your favorite sports?
He's impossible to argue with
She's the one who broke it
Why don't you?
There's a problem with him
He isn't rational at all
He isn't thinking clearly
I think I'm going insane
You prick!
Have you lost your mind?!
You lost your lair?
Are you a fairy?
Ugh... yes.
Do you grant wishes?
Races don't exist objectively
I'm afraid of everything
We're Mormons
I'm a Jehovah's Witness
I'm one of three siblings
It wasn't dark yet
Ziri didn't run anymore
Ziri isn't his real name
Ziri didn't run

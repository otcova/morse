Where exactly?
Were you also there?
That guy is very self-centered
He's just self-centered
Most months have 30 or 31 days
There's no air in this room
Why are you taking so long?
So, do you like Mary?
What's not to like?
She's an amazing woman.
You can't finish this project
You won't finish this project
What would you like to do?
Go on a picnic.
We aren't messaging
Are you messaging?
I'm going to go there
I know he doesn't love you
Who put a frog in my bed?
I will find you, Charley
Don't we all!
They're all fucking mental
Did you kill that man?
Yes or no?
God dammit!
What were you even thinking?
Do fries go with that shake?
Would you cut that crap out?
It's beyond insane!
What about your ears?
Just pretend you don't know me
What might Tom look like?
Can he be tall?
Does he have brown hair?
Does he wear glasses?
I was wrong again!
Many begin, but few finish
I'm not installing them
I'm not reinstalling them
I don't speak three languages
Is the room quiet?
Where is all the people?
Why is nobody here?
Happy birthday to me!
Did you get their letter?
Chill down, fatty.
Don't call me an idiot!
If problems come up, call me
I'm sorry I caused problems
You cheated too!
Don't cross your eyes
They'll get stuck that way!
He doesn't play disc golf
I won't disturb you
Are there green?
You've been forgotten
I'm from Thailand
You have solved that well!
I'm sorry for them
Yes, I cried then
Have you been to the barber?
How much does that car cost?
Say it anyway!
Sweet!
You're my heroine
Are you still available?
No, I'm happily taken.
Where will this trend lead?
He left about 10 minutes ago
I'm not that Jewish
King, stop calling me your boy
Have a good trip home!
Walk!
This dog doesn't bite
Can you drive the jeep?
Do you hear the beep?
Can I stroke your pussy?
How could you hate stoats?
Do cats meow?
Emily's home
Are you writing a letter now?
Are you a translator?
Where can we get together?
Tom decided to stay at Mary's
I doubt that he's a lawyer
Play the hand you're dealt
She doesn't like lotion at all
There's a math test tomorrow
What!?
These grapes don't taste good
Where have you bought them?
I know you don't have money
We didn't forget
Are you going to share that?
They're out of sugar now
Is hexane toxic?
I can't lie
Who burned the cake?
Go without thinking twice!
Is Tom on our team?
Is Tom on our team?
No, he's on the other team.
I beg of you, don't die!
It is all delicious!
It's five before four o'clock
It's five till four
They're in the library
I can't find my purse
It's five to four
I can't remember doing that
I've been crying a lot lately
Look, a stoat!
I don't accept your apology
I didn't see a soul
Ah, those Russians!
How weird!
Really?
Well then, I'm dumping you.
Wait, I was just joking!
Nothing much, really
Isn't that a bit obsessive?
It's just my personal hobby
Can't a man have a hobby?
What time is it?
Where was the wedding held?
You're the only friend I have
Tom, we're trapped!
Shut up, you're distracting me
She doesn't hate you, Tom
Mary doesn't hate you, Tom
Tom doesn't hate you, Mary
And I hate him!
I can't decide what to order
I'm afraid of reptiles
What the hell just happened?
Where does she buy books?
I'll be jealous
You're my only hope
Man, don't be daft
They've been at it for hours
He's a bit shorter than me
Nobody's forcing you to stay
Who made the sun?
It's worth trying it
They're good friends of ours
Take off your clothes!
Happy Qixi Festival!
Where can I get a rental car?
She's good with animals
But why would I help you?
Let's cook and eat the fish!
Do you have time?
It's already 4 o'clock
Now, I've lost all my patience
Luck's on my side today
I know we gotta stay quiet!
We'll have to talk later
Do you not understand?
Today I'm paying you for lunch
They didn't hear the children
Mine is bigger than Tom's
Worth a bump !
Not so close!
It'll be up soon
You should talk faster!
I'm getting a headache
Now it's getting better!
Kiss me, you fool!
I don't want to play anymore
I missed you guys so much!
Don't worry
What would they do without us?
You're under arrest!
You look exhausted, mate
Would you let me go?
I think they'll be late
What did Paola say?
I'm Paola
Let's speak about Paola
How late is late ?
I'm not abandoning them
Actually, yes
Did you say you had a cat?
What do you think, girls?
What do you think, guys?
I'll pay attention
Don't move till I get back
She doesn't even know me
You're beautiful in every way
She moved to Paris in 1966
Lend me your knife, please
What does the red plaque say?
Look at what you've done to me
It's a hit
They have already proven it!
We'd better wait
Anything's better than nothing
I'd rather die than give up
I'd rather die than do that
Oh, what a tasty meal!
There wasn't a soul
We've got other fish to fry
It was a near thing!
I got a real fright!
I'll complain about you
I'm cutting glass
I'm not amusing you
Listen to me, I beg of you
I don't feel safe here anymore
Men don't cry
You're not in bed yet?
Eat it!
He won't like that
Are you cops?
I don't dissolve them in acid
Stay drunk!
My mother is a teacher, too
Have you ever seen an axolotl?
How do you spell "bludgeon"?
We'll suppress the rebellion
A mutiny on my ship?
It's completely impossible
Do you know any female pilots?
It's neither here nor there
Do you see the white house?
I'm not engraving them
I'm choking!
He won't let me ask you
Are Scots really stingy?
I'll be paying in cash
It's very cold this evening
He'll certainly come visit us
I'm going to visit Tom today
Why didn't you come visit me?
Who?
Me?
Sometimes, smaller is better
I'll never forget that night
Thank you, Sherlock Holmes
Thanks, Sherlock
I'll never betray you
I'm glad you were able to come
I'm glad I didn't do that
What size shoe does he wear?
Where can I park my elephant?
It isn't a quilt
I don't drink vodka!
You're right
Can you really do it?
I don't dig up their potatoes
I'd like some poundcake
Don't worry
What may I eat?
It's not what you said
It's how you said it
I almost cried too!
What can I eat?
Who were the Maccabees?
I'm fed up with your attitudes
No one's body is perfect
I've never told anyone before
Do you think Tom is stupid?
I'm seriously considering it
I'll see you in court
I've forgotten his last name
Cheese isn't easy to digest
Do you take me for an idiot?
What's with the rush?
What's up with the rush?
Don't despair, ask Thomas!
Are you a god?
Please don't insult the boy!
Are you learning Chinese?
She's a wonderful girl
I didn't understand the humour
You're going to miss your ride
Don't put salt on my wounds!
Are they all the same price?
There's nothing we can do
Where does this trail lead?
Where does this path take you?
Let's do this again sometime!
I'm living a secular lifestyle
Do you have a shekel?
I need 100 shekels
You've spilled your coffee
Have you ever traveled alone?
What's goin on, bro?
I'm a native
Do they all cost the same?
Do these all cost the same?
Are these all the same price?
He didn't go to the lake
She didn't go to the lake
Tom can't grow a mustache yet
Do you want to work?
No.
Children can't drink wine
Children shouldn't drink wine
Are you using that?
Are you going to use that?
We're back to square one
Mary is Tom's stepsister
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, dear Mary!
Happy birthday to you!
Do you not want to respond?
Is the idea wrong?
Why are you there?
There you are!
How's the wife?
We're not in a hurry
It's true that it's not true?
I'm a tourist.
Hello!
With whom am I speaking?
You don't recognize me?
It's me, Aldo!
He's not at home
Believe me!
It only weighs 1.8 grammes
You don't know who this is?
It's me, Aldo
They'll never believe us
I was born on March 18th 1994
I'm dying to meet you all
What are you suggesting to me?
He's as happy as a king
I think everything's fine
I can't bear this hurt anymore
I'm dying of laughter
I'll be back in about an hour
Please don't touch the flowers
You think I'm stupid?
Absolutely!
My life, my rules
Can I braid your hair?
We're not in a hurry
Tom's mouth went dry
It's not polite to stare
Which fruit is red?
Hello, Lisa
Why did she stop her speech?
Why'd you go to Japan?
He wouldn't have thought twice
Who is eating?
I'm looking for this key
Who went with you?
I can't live like this
They were born in Tacuarembó
Have you ever been in Brazil?
I'm always stressed out
He isn't wearing a hat
Where can I borrow a car?
It's useless talking to her
It's useless talking to him
It's useless talking to them
Sorry, I can't stay long
Why are you still awake?
Tom isn't very manly
I’m tired of trolls on Tatoeba
Are you talking to yourself?
Mary isn't very feminine
We'll visit you
It could happen to anybody.
But it always happens to you!
Tom's house has three bedrooms
Tom has a 13-year-old daughter
Tom has a 13-year-old sister
Tom has a 3-year-old brother
Have there been consequences?
Are you having a nice summer?
They shouldn't have sued us
You're lucky to have a job
We're having problems here
We have 13 grandchildren
Tom has a 3-year-old son
Odds are you'll have fun
Tom, we have a problem
Tom has a half-sister
They have rights, too
Has Tom been indicted?
Where has Tom been?
How has Tom been?
Tom was sentenced to 13 months
There's a chance we'll be late
Here's the crux of the problem
Why are Tom and Mary hesitant?
Where will Tom be next summer?
What's the biggest difference?
Was that immediately apparent?
Tom's intentions were obvious
Tom's children were kidnapped
Tom was, of course, acquitted
Tom hasn't yet been to Boston
There are exceptions, however
It's a bit too early to gloat
Is that too expensive for you?
Is basketball season over yet?
Everybody's in the auditorium
Can these knives be sharpened?
Are you from the neighborhood?
Are these things really Tom's?
You're from Australia, right?
We're flirting with disaster
We shouldn't be lollygagging
Tom was, of course, innocent
Tom is Mary's second husband
There's one possible problem
That's not really a solution
Is this environmentally safe?
Are there any better options?
Actually that's a smart idea
You're Canadian, aren't you?
Which one was your favorite?
What kind of gadget is that?
We're cautiously optimistic
There's not much difference
Maybe Tom shouldn't be here
It's a very difficult issue
Is your toddler hyperactive?
Is that really Tom's sister?
Are you in Boston right now?
Are those people terrorists?
Wouldn't that be fantastic?
Who is taller, Tom or Mary?
What were the alternatives?
What are the possibilities?
Were you at the courthouse?
Tom's trial resumes Monday
Tom's technique was sloppy
Tom's room was a large one
Tom wasn't serious, was he?
Tom was a good-hearted guy
Tom was a cop for 13 years
Tom is the church's pastor
Tickets are $30 per person
This is everyone's problem
There's one big difference
There's nothing over there
That's probably a bad idea
That's an impractical idea
It's a hostile environment
It wasn't a smart decision
How sophisticated are they?
Fathers aren't the problem
Why wouldn't Tom be happy?
Who's taller, you or Tom?
What are your aspirations?
What are the similarities?
What are Tom's priorities?
Tom, you can't be serious?
Tom's options are limited
Tom's flight was canceled
Tom was, of course, happy
Tom was convicted in 2013
Tom was Mary's only child
Tom is the team's captain
Tom is kidding, of course
That's not the same thing
That's not a bad decision
That was wrong, of course
Obviously that isn't true
Linux, too, can be hacked
It's in the public domain
It's definitely good news
Is your neighborhood safe?
Is this really newsworthy?
How big a disaster was it?
Are they friends of yours?
Why is history important?
What are your priorities?
Tom's prognosis was poor
Tom's prognosis was grim
Tom was ordained in 2013
Tom was knighted in 2013
Tom is small, but strong
Tom is John's oldest son
Tom hasn't been home yet
They're right, of course
There's nobody else here
There's an easy solution
The movie wasn't too bad
That's not Tom's problem
Of course, Tom was there
Obviously, Tom was right
It's extremely important
It's been a chaotic week
It's a worldwide problem
It wasn't that different
It shouldn't be that way
It shouldn't be a secret
Is that unconstitutional?
How is Tom at basketball?
Cops can't be everywhere
Are you fluent in French?
Are you against abortion?
Are you actually serious?
Are things different now?
Are there any exceptions?
And that's the dilemma
You're the pathetic one
Why is that unfortunate?
Why aren't you outraged?
Who is that guy, anyway?
Where is everybody from?
Tom's house is very big
Tom was Mary's neighbor
This one's for you, Tom
That'll be inconvenient
Maybe that's the secret
It's not that different
It's not that deep here
It's kind of comforting
It's a huge opportunity
It's OK to be different
Is this really possible?
Is it really recyclable?
Is everyone still alive?
Boy, that was a rip-off
Are they really serious?
Are there enough people?
Are there any solutions?
Wow, this is different
Wouldn't that be great?
Will that be difficult?
Why were you so afraid?
Why is that ridiculous?
Who are the candidates?
Which is your favorite?
What were the symptoms?
What was your favorite?
What was the violation?
What are your expenses?
Were you being serious?
Wasn't that Tom's idea?
Tom's opponent was Mary
Tom's future is bright
Tom's behavior was bad
Tom was confident, too
Tom isn't funny either
Tom is Mary's landlord
This is good, isn't it?
There aren't that many
That wasn't the intent
That can't be possible
Now what's the problem?
Now here's the problem
Luckily, Tom was there
It's a daunting agenda
Isn't that the problem?
Is today really Monday?
Is this community safe?
Is it really necessary?
Is it OK to spank kids?
Is everybody happy now?
How was the experience?
How optimistic are you?
Are they all prisoners?
And that's the problem
And here's the problem
You're a naive person
Wouldn't that be good?
Why is this necessary?
Why can't you be cool?
Who's in the basement?
Who were the culprits?
Who exactly were they?
Where are the victims?
What's the fuss about?
What were the choices?
What was the response?
Wasn't that dangerous?
Was it worth anything?
Was it that immediate?
Tom's dog is very big
Tom's car was totaled
They can't be serious
That'll be impossible
That was a no-brainer
It's very comfortable
It's just another day
It's almost lunchtime
It wasn't good enough
It was nobody's fault
It was expensive, too
Is this really Monday?
Is this even possible?
Is this data accurate?
Is thirty days enough?
Is that too expensive?
Is it that irrelevant?
How many were wounded?
How is this different?
How is everything now?
How important is this?
How impatient are you?
How are they the same?
Everything's the same
Everybody's different
Are you people stupid?
Are you a shareholder?
Are things better now?
And that's the danger
You can't be serious?
Why is that critical?
Why are you frowning?
Who is the architect?
Who are they exactly?
When was Tom's trial?
What's in the garage?
What was the purpose?
What really is wrong?
We're from Australia
Tom's family is poor
This isn't Australia
There were 30 guests
The problem is Tom's
That's an awful idea
That wasn't possible
It's very sad indeed
It's nice to be here
It's a deadly poison
It wasn't their idea
It wasn't that great
Is that so difficult?
How was it different?
How is Tom different?
How important is Tom?
How flexible are you?
How different is Tom?
Are you in Australia?
Are you guys serious?
Are you exaggerating?
Are you a journalist?
Are you a Republican?
Why isn't that good?
Why is it tolerated?
Why are you ashamed?
Who's that with Tom?
Who was the captain?
Where's the ketchup?
Where is your mommy?
What's the evidence?
What was their goal?
What was down there?
What are your goals?
Tom's hobby is golf
Tom wasn't the star
Tom is jealous, too
That's the standard
That was Tom's idea
That isn't the case
It's rather strange
It's kind of boring
It's been difficult
It's a huge problem
It's a group effort
It wasn't that cold
It was mind-numbing
Is this really real?
Is this really news?
Is that significant?
Is that good enough?
Is that fair enough?
Is that a submarine?
Is that Tom's voice?
Is it all necessary?
Is Tom still around?
Is Tom absent today?
How was your winter?
How is your husband?
Here's a novel idea
Are you fast enough?
Are you by yourself?
Are you an optimist?
Are you an imposter?
Are you a sophomore?
Are we really safer?
You're misinformed
Wow, that was good
Wow, that was easy
Why is Tom unhappy?
Who's their mother?
Who's the boss now?
Who was here first?
Where was everyone?
Where was Tom then?
Where are the cops?
We're all students
Tom's dog is white
Tom isn't a racist
Tom is John's twin
This isn't unusual
They're the police
That's unrealistic
That's impractical
That's OK with Tom
That wasn't enough
It's their problem
It's probably true
It's not very good
It's not very easy
It's not a holiday
It's been terrible
It's all our fault
It's a huge secret
It's a French word
It'll be worthless
It'll be different
It wasn't that big
Is this story true?
Is that the future?
Is that still true?
Is that deliberate?
Is Tom your friend?
Is Tom a foreigner?
Is Monday too late?
How much is enough?
How likely is that?
Are you there, Tom?
Are you still sick?
Are you better now?
Are you an elitist?
Are you an athlete?
Are you an atheist?
Are things bad now?
Whose kid is that?
Who was your date?
Who are those for?
Which one is best?
Where's the knife?
Where's Tom's car?
Where will Tom be?
What's the remedy?
What was so funny?
What are the odds?
We're very frugal
We're the problem
Was it really Tom?
Tom's a smart guy
There's no way in
That's the system
That's the danger
Now, that's funny
It's really muddy
It's kind of hard
It's just a novel
It's just a hunch
It's fun out here
It's been a blast
Is there a remedy?
Is that warranted?
Is that notarized?
Is that mandatory?
Is that a stapler?
Is Tom still safe?
How serious is it?
How good are they?
Would that be OK?
Will you be next?
Whose bike is it?
Who was the best?
Which is cheaper?
Which boy is Tom?
We'll be patient
We can't be late
Tom's a huge guy
That's the trend
That's the ideal
Now that's funny
No one's certain
It's a tradition
It's a sad story
It's a nice town
It's a huge task
It's a huge loss
It'll be awesome
Is this uncommon?
Is this too high?
Is that too late?
Is that so wrong?
Is that an issue?
Is it summer yet?
Is 2:30 too late?
How young is Tom?
How safe is that?
Are you all nuts?
Why are you sad?
Who is this for?
Which are Tom's?
What'll be next?
Were they right?
That's the goal
That'll be good
No one's hungry
Is it really OK?
Is Tom bluffing?
Are they purple?
Who's with Tom?
What's up, Tom?
It's marvelous
It's been good
It'll be chaos
How was Tom?
Are you 18?
What a disgusting individual!
What a heartbreaking story!
What a ridiculous comment!
What a heartwarming story!
Tom should've surrendered
You can't copyright that
What a great experience!
Can you elaborate a bit?
What an incredible day!
What an awesome family!
What a beautiful woman!
What a stupid comment!
What a sad commentary!
What an awful mother!
What a great country!
What a bizarre story!
What total nonsense!
What an awful band!
What a stupid idea!
What a pretty lady!
What a tacky idea!
What a novel idea!
What a sad story!
What a hypocrite!
What a great guy!
Who stabbed Tom?
What a treasure!
What a prospect!
What a pleasure!
What a nice guy!
Good luck, Tom
Tom's behavior is unacceptable
Would this be acceptable?
We've accomplished that goal
What a great accomplishment!
It's a great accomplishment
What have you accomplished?
What will this accomplish?
What has Tom accomplished?
We've accomplished a lot
What did you accomplish?
What was accomplished?
That's a huge achievement
Can that be achieved?
What an achievement!
What was achieved?
That'll be addressed
Tickets are $3
Admission is $30 at the gate
Admission is $3.00 at the door
Can you advise me?
Will this affect me?
Who can afford this?
What can you afford?
Can you afford that?
Can Tom afford that?
Tom said he didn't agree
What was the agreement?
Are these allegations true?
Should this be allowed?
Why is this allowed?
Tom's new song is amazing
Tom's music is amazing
What an amazing story!
It's rather amusing
We're still awaiting an answer
Tom isn't answering his mobile
Who else knows the answer?
Perhaps that's the answer
Can anyone answer that?
Here's the answer
Tom won't have to apologize
Why should Tom apologize?
Tom hasn't apologized
How does this apply?
Do you feel unappreciated?
I like Tom's approach
Who approved this?
What a ludicrous argument!
Has Tom ever been arrested?
Police arrested 13 people
When was Tom arrested?
Was Tom ever arrested?
There were 13 arrests
I should've asked Tom to help
We've even asked Tom to help
I've asked Tom to work late
I've asked Tom for a loan
I asked for Tom's help
You'd better ask Tom
I didn't have to ask
I assume that you're Canadian
Is Tom paying attention?
We won't be back any time soon
Eventually, Tom will be back
We're thrilled to be back
I'm thrilled to be back
Are we coming back here?
We'll be back shortly
Tom said he'd be back
Is Tom back already?
I'm a laid-back guy
Let's double back
Has Tom come back?
We won't be back
Tom is a natural-born teacher
Is the pain unbearable?
Were you born there?
Don't be a bore
Do you feel unbeatable?
Do you actually believe this?
Will they believe Tom?
Do you believe it now?
Who would believe me?
Who will you believe?
Can we believe them?
Who do you believe?
Who believes that?
Who benefited from that?
Who benefits from this?
Who benefits from that?
Who did my dog bite?
You're all to blame
Tom can't be blamed
Why blame just Tom?
Who is to blame?
No one's to blame
Who do we blame?
I've been blessed
Don't forget that Tom is blind
There's blood everywhere
It was mind-blowing
Is this Tom's book?
Is anything bothering you?
Why are you bothering me?
Don't bother to respond
We don't take coffee breaks
What law did Tom break?
What laws were broken?
Tom broke Mary's jaw
I'm broken-hearted
I broke Tom's nose
I've brought a gift for Tom
Who brought lunch today?
What'll Tom bring?
Where were these built?
The insulation shouldn't burn
I've stopped buying meat there
Who would buy one of those?
Let's buy something else
I bought Tom's new novel
What should we buy?
Would you buy one?
I can't be bought
What did Tom buy?
Should I buy it?
Tom immediately called 911
Someone finally called 911
Tom called around 2:30
What are they called?
Who calls the shots?
Who should I call?
We'll capture them
Does anybody really care?
Will anyone really care?
Why would anyone care?
Why does anyone care?
Why should Tom care?
So who really cares?
Do they really care?
Why should we care?
Who would've cared?
Why does Tom care?
Does anybody care?
Who really cares?
What kind of gun do you carry?
That's the catch
Who caught Tom?
Do you know what causes that?
What causes that to happen?
What caused this to happen?
What caused the accident?
What caused the problem?
What caused the crash?
What caused the fire?
What are the causes?
Did Tom cause this?
How are you celebrating today?
Are you celebrating something?
We should've celebrated
Why would I celebrate?
What were the challenges?
That's a huge challenge

Are you going to lie to me?
Sami didn't have experience
Can we make this work?
Can our marriage be restored?
Sami didn't see that in Layla
It's quite funny to me
Sami should honor God's word
Sami's heart was broken
Sami's wound was so big
That's the honest truth
That's your best revenge
Sami doesn't feel ashamed
Crying ruins your make-up
Sami is highly self-reliant
It wasn't Sami's fault at all
Sami knew Layla's voice
It's time.
Time for what?
It's time for Sami to marry
Sami wasn't a faithful husband
Who was Sami with?
Sami's pain took time to heal
How can Sami still love Layla?
Sami is Layla's husband
Layla was the pastor's wife
Sami didn't answer his phone
Sami doesn't know what to do
Sami noticed Layla's reaction
Layla was Sami's assistant
Sami's marriage was over
Sami wasn't sleeping
That's when it all started
Sami's marriage was imploding
How did God change you?
How's your marriage today?
Sami's house was not locked
Did I marry the right person?
God's word is hope
As Sami drove, he wept
Sami's priorities have changed
Sami's affair was exposed
Sami was Layla's secret lover
I'm looking forward to Monday
It will not take long, right?
It's fine if you want to go
Sami's anger erupted
Sami couldn't deal with that
I'm done this time
Why is life so horrible?
Sami's prayer was answered
Don't show me anything else
Sami couldn't pay employees
Sami couldn't pay his mortgage
Sami didn't pay taxes
Sami didn't come home
Sami's marriage was dead
Sami tragically died in 2006
Sami's alibi checked out
These are Sami's life savings
Tom left about 30 minutes ago
Why are you crying?
I'm feeling bad
Burn the witch!
Searching won't do
Why?
Mm, yeah.
How much does the beer cost?
How much does beer cost?
How much does an apple cost?
Are you a policewoman?
The first jump didn't end well
Is this a real diamond?
We're in the same time zone
Sami's arms were going numb
It's still not happening
Women came into Sami's life
That's my mom's idea!
Are all metals malleable?
Are all powders fine?
Let's go for a run.
Let's not.
What's the matter, sweetie?
What's the matter, sweetheart?
What's the matter, pumpkin?
Hi, my name's Nick
Nice to—" "I have a boyfriend.
Forgot password?
Galileo Galilei's real name?
Don't blame yourself
15, 2017
Do you miss your wife?
C'mon man, don't be stingy
Can you read music?
What does that word mean?
Oh, it doesn't mean anything
Who is being naughty?
Let's all drink!
Incredibly, Sami clung to life
Do you have a soup tureen?
Tell me, where are you?
Sami couldn't take a breath
Sami's daughter ran away
My mother's praying
And here's our garden
See you, grandpa!
Yes, we promise
Do you know what I think?
Is he coming along?
I am working on something, Tom
Why am I hungry?
Don't tell me you believe him
Never change anything!
Watch out!
Here comes the fuzz!
What a charming place!
What a beautiful castle!
It's over, we're out of gas
Oh, what a cute child!
I'm going to go dance
Stop!
You strayed!
Tom was clean-shaven
I thought I'd just pop by
Have you seen his new film?
Is this a bomb?
What'll you write about?
You're dirty
I didn't know French that well
Aren't you all done?
Are you one of my cousins?
We'll attack at sunrise
I've never been to Boston
You'd better go to sleep
You should've stopped
I think Tom isn't home
Did Tom like it?
Does Tom like wine?
Trust me, I've seen worse
Down with the czar!
She's eating
You're such an old whingebag
He's a whingebag
Wait!
I'm coming!
Who is it?
It's Jim.
Are you really Italian?
So it was true!
He's a good kid
I think Tom won't come
You're stupid to trust Tom
You're not Canadian, are you?
You'll pay for it
You'll have to work a lot
You'll find this lesson easy
I've just turned thirty
It's essential that we do that
What city is this?
What village is this?
What town is this?
What country is this?
What river is this?
What language is that?
What dialect is this?
What dialect is that?
What dialect are you speaking?
You will come to pick me up?
Tell me, aren't you hungry?"
This key doesn't work
Where does Tom come from?
He comes from the university.
What does the F5 key do?
Has her Highness slept well?
I'd gladly pay $500 for it
Sex and drugs were Sami's life
I know you're dating again
He'll show up soon
Can you stay a bit longer?
I don't need you in my life
Will we meet again?
Think, then speak
That's under discussion
Sami didn't stop singing
Tom isn't a minor
Sami doesn't eat pork chops
Sami just didn't do it
Sami doesn't smoke now
Sami's favorite food is pasta
I haven't told anybody else
I haven't told anyone else
So are you coming or not?
Sami drifted into Layla's life
The compound interest!
What about the girl?
I'm sorry
I wasn't paying attention
I am sorry, It's all my fault
I think it'll snow tomorrow
I hope that you're not afraid
I'm too busy to help Tom
I'm the same height as Tom is
I'm sure Tom will return soon
I'm sure Tom will get mad
I'm sure I'll find a way
I'm sure Tom will leave early
I'm sorry, but Tom isn't home
I'm not a cop
I'm sorry Tom isn't here
It's Mobility Week!
I'm not as intelligent as Tom
I'm meeting Tom this evening
I'm going to Boston this fall
I'm aware that Tom did that
I'm assuming you're Canadian
I'm afraid Tom can't do it
Can you lend me $20?
I'll pay you back next Monday
As it is above, so it is below
Recently, I've tired quickly
Is Sami telling the truth?
You're having an affair.
It was just a fling.
I'm sure Mary will understand
Neither now nor in the future!
Neither today nor ever!
This is Tom's only chance
This is Tom's car, I think
This house isn't very big
That'll change nothing
May you be rich!
This is true love!
What love!
I don't fly
Are you learning Kazakh?
This is a really good book!
How is your health?
We are expecting you!
She doesn't like idols
Look in the mirror!
Is there a toilet somewhere?
Is your sister there?
I don't know how to read yet
Nobody's seen Tom and Mary
No one's seen Tom and Mary
Are Tom and Mary your kids?
Are Tom and Mary well?
No, they're not.
Are Tom and Mary well?
No, they aren't.
Tom and Mary don't like John
What're they doing here?
I'd like to talk to them
You don't need to drive them
Would you mind helping them?
You'll need to help them
You'll have to help them
Could you please help them?
You'll have to help them
I'm looking for Tom and Mary
Could you please help them?

I haven't seen them recently
Tom and Mary can't do it alone
Could you please help them?
Is that true?
I can't find Tom and Mary
I think they must've gone home
Tom and Mary like it, too
Now they can't stand him
I have to study, too
I don't need to wash the car
I don't have to wash the car
They've moved to Boston
I'm looking for Tom and Mary
Do you know where they are?
Tom and Mary aren't friends
They're just acquaintances
Why are you doing the dishes?
We can't let Tom and Mary walk
Let's give them a ride
I'm not going to go
Could you please be quieter?
You're just in time
Tom and Mary can't do it alone
I'm not going
Are Tom and Mary afraid?
No, I don't think so.
Tom and Mary got new jobs.
What kind of jobs?
Don't tell Tom and Mary
I don't want to worry them
Tom and Mary aren't at home
They're at work
Have Tom and Mary done that?
No, not yet.
Are Tom and Mary afraid?
Yes, I think so.
I'm looking for Tom and Mary
Have you seen them?
I'm sure they will
Tom and Mary want hugs, too
Can you help them?
Tom and Mary aren't here
Where are Tom and Mary now?

Let's hope Tom and Mary are OK
If Tom and Mary go, I won't go
I've seen Tom and Mary do that
I'm sure Tom and Mary are fine
I'm offering Tom and Mary jobs
I'm glad Tom and Mary are safe
I'm glad Tom and Mary are home
I'm glad Tom and Mary are here
I'm glad Tom and Mary are gone
I'm glad Tom and Mary are back
I'll make Tom and Mary do that

I hope Tom and Mary don't sing
I hope Tom and Mary don't mind

Tom isn't yet certain
Tom isn't certain yet
Tom isn't scared of anyone
Tom isn't scared of anybody
Tom isn't going to watch TV
Tom isn't going to give up
Tom isn't going to catch us
Tom won't catch us
Tom isn't going to be afraid
Tom isn't going that far
Tom won't be going that far
Tom isn't as fast as you
Tom isn't as fast as you are
That'll cause problems
Somebody's singing
No one laughs at Tom's jokes
It's going to be very hard
It must've been expensive
It isn't snowing
It's not snowing
It isn't raining
I've created a few websites
I'm not much older than Tom
I'm not much older than Tom is
I'm not as fast as you are
I'd rather stay home tonight
I'd like to buy a drink
I wish I'd done this earlier
I wasn't at all surprised
I haven't yet told anyone else
I haven't told anyone else yet
I can't possibly do that alone
Everyone else does it, too
Everybody else does it, too
Everybody did that, except Tom
Don't tell anyone where Tom is
Does Tom live alone?
Does Tom live by himself?
Do you both know Tom?
Both Tom and Mary can't swim
Both Tom and Mary can't drive
Both Tom and Mary aren't busy
Tom and Mary both aren't busy
Would you like to go with me?
I will be, but Tom won't be.
Could you drive them home?
Would you like it?
Do you want to come with us?
My car isn't very reliable
You don't need all of these
I'd prefer not to call Tom
I'd rather write him an email
I don't need to call Tom
I'm not watching it
Do you and Tom often do that?
I do, but Tom doesn't.
Tom didn't need to come here
He could've just called
Tom doesn't live here anymore
He's moved to Boston
Tom can play the guitar, too
Is Tom here?
Tom didn't need to take a taxi
He could've walked
Tom didn't need to speak
Tom didn't have to take a taxi
He could've walked
There's no need to hurry
We've got plenty of time
It's very sharp
I've just made some coffee
Would you like a cup?
I don't think I'll buy this
It's too expensive
Tom didn't have to tell Mary
That's a good idea
Why didn't I think of that?
Tom isn't a friend
He's just an acquaintance
I didn't enjoy my last job
That's why I quit
I'm sorry I was late
It won't happen again
I'm eating dinner now
Can I call you later?
I work in Boston.
I work in Boston, too.
Where did you get them?
It's my fault
I wasn't paying attention
I think I'll buy it
Where did you get it?
I'm tired

What kind of a person is Tom?
Tom isn't an angel
You can't keep that secret
You'll feel cold
It's going to rain
Are they all ready?
Are all of them ready?
Don't misuse this product!
Come and see for yourself!
Don't underestimate yourself
I'm a seriously ill man
Are you beginners?
Are you novices?
He's a foreigner
We're invited too
Do you consume liquor?
That's no big deal
Are you making fun of me?
No, I'm not.
Tom didn't deny it
Do you still recognize me?
How can one stop smoking?
I realized that I can't win
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What are you thinking about?
I was thinking about you.
What were you thinking about?
Don't use up all the hot water
What am I hearing now?
You don't want to be happy
Are you ready for Christmas?
Everything's ready for you
Has there been any progress?
How are things in Australia?
How serious is this problem?
I wonder why Tom wasn't there
I'll probably vote for Tom
I've already eaten enough
I've been to Australia
Isn't that a little strange?
It was inevitable, wasn't it?
It was wonderful, wasn't it?
It wasn't a good experience
It wasn't really a surprise
It'll be a great experience
It's a little bit dangerous
It's a little bit different
It's a real difficult issue
It's a really bad situation
It's a really good question
It's a very personal choice
It's a very serious illness
It's a very serious problem
It's a very strange process
It's always been quiet here
It's definitely a good sign
It's exactly what they want
It's exactly what we needed
It's hard to stay objective
It's new and very different
It's not a conspiracy
It's not an unfair proposal
You aren't sick
With whom did you talk?
With whom did he talk?
With whom had you spoken?
I'm sorry, but I must insist
It's not hard to understand
It's only taken three years
It's our only option
It's pretty easy to imagine
It's probably not OK
It's sure to be interesting
It's very important to vote
It's very strange and weird
With whom did you speak?
With whom did she speak?
Since when is Richard married?
When did Richard get married?
With whom are you speaking?
You don't need to yell
I can't stand children crying
What a beautiful photo!
What's in your backpack?
Do you intend to leave us?
Let's not split hairs
Let's talk about the future
Let's try something different
Let's work together on this
Look, what's this all about?
Nobody's life was in danger
It's our car
With whom had they spoken?
Why do you ask Tom?
Whose decision is it?
That's a hard question
That isn't the question
That's not true anymore
That's really hard work
There's a small problem
We're not the champions
Stop being narrow-minded
Tom's lights are still on
Now there's another option
Well, what's wrong with it?
What else can you remember?
What exactly are the rules?
What exactly is the threat?
What exactly is this about?
What exactly is your point?
What were they waiting for?
What's Tom supposed to say?
What's the door locked for?
What's the reason for that?
What's the use of worrying?
What's there to comment on?
What's wrong with you, Tom?
What's your opinion of Tom?
That's really difficult work
Who else was staying there?
Why hasn't Tom been jailed?
Now you're just being silly
OK, that's enough for today
People think that it's easy
Right now, things are tense
That doesn't matter anymore
That isn't really the point
That's a really old picture
That's actually a good idea
That's all that matters now
That's fundamentally unfair
That's not the entire story
That's not the problem here
That's not the real problem
That's not what we're about
That's what they always say
What's wrong with this plan?
Right now, people are scared
Tom's wife's a friend of mine
I've heard of worse things
Let's see what can be done
Who likes reading books?
I don't eat any bread
Tom's plan is simple
I wasn't ready for that
There've been no injuries
We'll need more than that
We're still short on cash
We're working on that now
Tom said he wasn't injured
They're all waiting for you
They're quicker than we are
This isn't a trivial matter
This last week's been crazy
Tom hasn't won anything yet
Tom isn't afraid of anybody
Tom isn't aggressive at all
Tom said that wasn't enough
Tom says it's a possibility
Tom simply can't be trusted
Tom thinks that's a mistake
Tom's family was also there
Tom's father is a policeman
Tom's father was a diplomat
Tom's mother is a housewife
Tom's parents are both dead
Tom's parents must be proud
Tom's father's name was John
Tom hasn't eaten anything yet
Tom's attitude is pretty good
I don't know where everyone is
We'll need more food than that
We'll need more time than that
A week later, she died
No, I won't say anything
I'm just leaving now
You're actually wrong
Tom's truck was stolen
You've had enough time
We're all amateurs here
We'll miss your laughter
I haven't read the report
Tom's wife's name is Mary
We've solved that mystery
We haven't lost everything
We'll never know the truth
When were you in Australia?
You're not limping anymore
We haven't reached our goal
We just weren't good enough
We think it's pretty simple
We weren't surprised at all
We weren't worried about it
It's finally my turn
They didn't choose me
You don't know him, but I do
It's OK, I'm invincible
Thank you.
No, thank you.
Is he friendly to you?
I don't pet your dogs
Can elephants sneeze?
That's not the truth
We've all missed you
Everyone's happy again
That's a fair question
You're a lawyer, right?
Is that really important?
Isn't this what you wanted?
We're not used to visitors
We've been here for months
Haven't we done this before?
It's not my problem anymore
Something's wrong with that
Something's wrong with this
There's no air conditioning
There's no installation fee
There's no student discount
There's reason for optimism
What floor does he live on?
Don't begin without me
Why did you begin without me?
Who started the battle?
Tom's father is called John
It's a special situation
I'm not lowering your salaries
We're going downtown
We're all smarter than that
We're fortunate to have Tom
We're no different than Tom
We're not scared of anybody
We're not totally ready yet
We're very confident in Tom
We're very serious about it
We've all been working hard
We've been waiting for that
We've been waiting for this
Well, that's not quite true
Well, what's the matter now?
What are they interested in?
What can't you live without?
What makes you so confident?
Who knows this guy?
I won't stay here for long
He usually doesn't brag
What do you want to tell me?
What time are they starting?
What trips are you planning?
What was that meeting about?
What were the meetings like?
What were your parents like?
What's so special about Tom?
What's the idea behind that?
What's the weather like now?
What's your opinion on that?
Where are those people from?
Where are those posters now?
Who can tell the difference?
Will this year be different?
You'll never know the truth
You'll never see that again
You're your own worst enemy
Is it right, Ms./Mr.?
Why are you driving us out?
Shall I report a truce or war?
Won't you ever speak?
You have heard, seen, suffered
Oinoë had been fortifed
Why silent?
O that I had so much power!
Ah! that Cyrus were living!
What shall I experience?
What will happen to me?
Am I to fail of your fate?
What shall we say to this?
Anything else than to agree?
What shall I do?
How can I desert the fleet?
Whither shall one flee?
Where shall I go and abide?
My children, let us rise
Let me go to her!
Let us not wait for οthers
May you die!
May it only depend on that!
How should I find death?
Where might the strangers be?
But take her within, slaves
Stop, speak no farther!
No serious news, I hope?
He hasn't injured you, has he?
Don't keep chattering
There's need of a fight
You there, what are you doing?
I'm not crazy
You're the one who's crazy
Why do you have diarrhea?
Are you coming?
Of course.
A beaver's fur is very soft
Can stress actually kill you?
Can't this problem be solved?
How many people are involved?
Is competition good for kids?
Is that not possible anymore?
Is there reason for optimism?
Is there some other solution?
Isn't that a little juvenile?
Isn't that against the rules?
Isn't there anything in here?
Isn't this against the rules?
It won't necessarily be easy
It'll be an interesting game
It'll be different, for sure
It's a very complex question
It's all that really matters
It's hard being a politician
It's just basic common sense
It's more than a coincidence
What, then, is this?
Guard this, cling to this
Do not abandon us, I entreat
I'm afraid yοu need a whipping
Do you really not remember me?
Tom's dog can swim well
Do you approve that?
At the corner, he turned left
You'll be expelled from school
God, make me patient!
God, give me patience!
Who is my neighbor?
Tom is Mary's former boyfriend
It's unlikely Tom will help us
What are your long term plans?
Tom is John's younger brother
This isn't really Tom's fault
That's what we're waiting for
So what is everyone's problem?
Please don't open this window
Oh, it's quite simple, really
It's unlikely Tom will return
Can anyone really replace Tom?
Why is everyone so surprised?
Where've you been recently?
Where are you supposed to be?
What's the problem with that?
What makes a good journalist?
Well, what's wrong with that?
We're very satisfied with it
We're better off without Tom
Tom's family is in Australia
Tom's body has been cremated
Tom wasn't wearing a uniform
Tom wasn't always this happy
Tom isn't that young anymore
They're a good baseball team
There's not a big difference
There's just not enough time
There's a lot of competition
There won't be anything left
There won't be any surprises
Will you visit me?
You swam in this lake, right?
Because I'm cold.
That's what we did next
I'm a monster
Do you grow your own potatoes?
You are an incredible guy!
Maybe some examples will help?
He's not angry
Here's a message for you
Tom's dad is named Jean
The emergency's not over yet
The bathroom's down the hall
That's what we're working on
That's what we're waiting on
That's what we're aiming for
That's what we always wanted
That's the reason we're here
That wasn't a tough decision
That might've been a mistake
That certainly won't be easy
Tell us what you're thinking
So what are the implications?
I'm a busy person
Praised be the sun god!
When in doubt, leave it out
I did not say that, he did
It's clearly suitable
Most of them just don't care
He's too clingy
Summer is almost here!
It is a cherry-picking concept
I demand a refund!
I'm being raked over the coals
I'm not one to judge
Dad, put Mum on the phone
Monday's game was rained out
Maybe you're trying too hard
Maybe Tom can't speak French
Tom hasn't learned his lesson
Tom is actually Mary's brother
She couldn't open that bottle
Oh!
I know this man!
For me, all days are holidays
Do you come here a lot?
It's already 11 o'clock
It's raining?
Wow, it's snow!
Don't worry much
It'll be OK
I'll give this to Tom
This was my dad's favorite tie
Tom wasn't wearing a seatbelt
Tom wasn't like most soldiers
Tom wasn't angry with anybody
Tom was robbed at knife-point
Tom said that's very uncommon
Tom remained there until 2013
Tom pretended he wasn't there
Tom's family needed money
Tom married John's widow
Tom wasn't nervous
It's wretchedly cold
I'm a loner
He isn't at his best
Check out our website!
The answer isn't correct
Handle with care!
He'll buy something
Don't fell the young trees
Shall I close it?
Shall I open it?
This is treason, my friends!
I'm just helping
She's afraid of this dog
Don't be intimidated
I've been touched by death
Just do as you're told!
I'll take the responsibility
I'll be careful next time
I won't eat the apple's core
Do you want to get rich here?
He'll be coming back tomorrow
It's really cold!
I earned a bachelor's degree
I'm going now!
Break it!
Think first!
I can't think of the name
The name doesn't come to me
Yes, don't worry!
He's never questioned
There's room
Be gone!
Stay away!
Get your ass out of here!
Away with you!
How about you?
She's a lovable person
Were we really happy together?
How old is your grandpa?
What is your daughter's name?
I'm not here because of that
I don't want to do the work
You're a teacher, right?
Is it over?
Was that Tom?
I can't skate
It's now 2:30
I'm tired, too
Is it over yet?
A car's coming
Am I that scary?
Was that for me?
Who stabbed you?
Can you hurry up?
I love Tom's car
Is anyone around?
Tom didn't budge
Tom died at 2:30
Will that happen?
How are you, guys?
Is everyone ready?
Is this a new car?
It's been snowing
It's time to start
Can you hurry it up?
Why are you nervous?
Tom woke up at 2:30
Tom shot Mary's dog
This is Tom's diary
I'm good at skating
I can't go with Tom
Does Tom have a job?
Do you have my book?
Did you just get up?
Did you go upstairs?
Are any of you hurt?
Why's everyone wet?
Were you concerned?
We're glad to help
Tom didn't testify
Tom didn't say yes
The pizza's ready
How was work today?
Everyone's worried
Aren't you excited?
Who could do that?
Were you speeding?
My car's dirty
His salary doesn't satisfy him
I'm afraid that he is right
At four, we can go home
He can't stand carrots
I'm starting at noon
He can't hold a conversation
Don't hesitate to ask me
What will you do on vacation?
I couldn't get what you said
I can't get into this building
Tom's plan has been successful
Tom's name was never mentioned
Tom's father was an accountant
Tom's family has been notified
Tom's body was never recovered
Tom's body never was recovered
Are you missing something?
Tom is Mary's youngest son
It's time for bed now
Tom isn't too happy
Fuck off!
He's not the greatest at math
You get on my nerves!
I've been taken by surprise
She's being serious
She isn't joking
She's going to escape
We'll get good grades
There's something fishy
She is nobody's fool
Let me cook!
Let's save the world!
Let's explore the forest!
Let's not go crazy!
She's planning a trip
Are you good at basketball?
I want to have a baby now!
I don't see it as art
Tom didn't need that
Tom didn't feel safe
Tom broke Mary's mug
It's your turn, Tom
Hiding yourself won't help
Sit down, Tom
I'm elegible to vote now
Tom couldn't trust Mary
Tom didn't go outside
That's probably right
Can I sleep at your place?
Tom, Maria!
How is this called?
This umbrella, whose is it?
This car, whose is it?
Can I use Mastercard?
How is school?
It's strawberry season
How is work?
How was it, the test?
I said sorry, didn't I?
What's today's dinner?
Thomas can't leave
I can't be at my best
He's hurrying up
He's doing the best he can
He's losing his balance
Stop running your mouth!
We'll see how well it unfolds
Tom didn't go to the prom
You're a creep, Mister!
Get your shit together!
Get it together!
Toughen up!
It's quite irritating
You have a child-like face
Is your son blind?
Why do you detest Mary?
Why are you always shouting?
Why do you detest Tom?
Some died, others were wounded
We're always learning
Who knows that guy?
I'd like to go to Paris now
Some friend you are!
Did you break that?
I'm being helped
Stop all the fuss!
That car salesman isn't honest
Why do you not like Tom?
Tom is a well-respected man
Tom didn't do it by himself
Tom burned Mary's picture
This car used to be Tom's
I know that I'll die soon
Tom didn't press charges
Tom didn't look too good
Tom didn't kill his wife
Tom didn't do it himself
Tom didn't blame himself
Tom became Mary's friend
That wasn't Tom's choice
I don't see Tom anywhere
Was Tom here last night?
Tom's car has new tires
Tom won't talk about it
Tom went to Mary's home
Tom was Mary's only son
Tom isn't naive anymore
Tom is now 13 years old
Tom didn't make a sound
I've told Tom the truth
I can't stop hiccuping
Where is Tom right now?
Tom stole Mary's purse
Tom couldn't save Mary
Who did Tom come with?
Tom couldn't see Mary
Why is Tom so scared?
Tom was well-behaved
Tom was well-dressed
Tom was nervous, too
I don't love anyone else
It wasn't where I parked it
I wasn't born knowing
Mary, please tell me the truth
Mary thinks Tom's work is easy
Don't move these books
How long will I have to wait?
Tom's daughter is now thirteen
Tom drove to Mary's house
Tom drove by Mary's house
I guess Tom didn't see me
Tom's feelings were hurt
Tom was murdered in 2013
Tom grabbed Mary's wrist
Tom got home around 2:30
Tom didn't yell for help
Tom didn't try to resist
Tom didn't remember Mary
Don't touch her!
Don't touch him!
I'm sorry
You'll become a mother
You'll become a father
You'll become a teacher
Why do you always scream?
I want to sleep!
Have you eaten enough?
You're accusing me unfairly
Do you see that woman?
She's my wife
Do you see those women?
Do you see that man?
He's my husband
Please, don't beat me!
Don't beat me!
Don't be annoying
Don't annoy me
I've accused you unfairly
I've accused you unfairly
I'm respectful
Stop the car now!
Toss it there!
I don't trust local TV
They're very clever
Tom swears he's innocent
Tom returned empty-handed
Do I have financial problems?
Am I the first?
It's cheaper to take the bus
Don't eat raw vegetables
Who doesn't like free stuff?
Tom used Mary's cellphone
Am I to follow you?
Shall I follow you?
We're not far from Tom's
Tom will pick Mary up at 2:30
Tom wasn't seriously hurt
Tom still hasn't come home
Tom snuck into Mary's house
Tom left a little after 2:30
Tom isn't wearing shoes
Tom isn't good at lying
Tom is afraid of Mary's dog
Tom is a nice-looking boy
Tom hasn't slept in three days
Tom got home about 2:30
Tom got here just before 2:30
Tom didn't make much money
Tom couldn't fight anymore
Tom arrived around 2:30
Tom and Mary weren't alone
There's no way Tom'll win
Should I apologize to Tom?
I still don't feel safe
Has Tom been lying to Mary?
Well, that's a fair question
But here's another question
There's one in Swedish also
I'm on the winning path now
Why is Tom acting this way?
Why is Tom acting like this?
Where on earth have you been?
What Tom told Mary wasn't true
Tom's suitcase is missing
Tom doesn't really talk much
Tom doesn't really know Mary
Tom didn't want to go there
We aren't serious
He didn't understand his joke
She isn't surprised at all
What a boring task!
That girl isn't stupid
That girl isn't dumb
Is that a good or a bad thing?
This is Tom's favorite book
That wouldn't surprise me
How many horses does Tom own?
Slow down!
You're driving too fast!
You're driving too fast
Is it snowing out there?
You need to take note of this!
From which point?
Hillary's speech was hilarious
Tom's speech was hilarious
Tom's speech was really funny
I've got the munchies
I don't know who I am
I don't like my work
She's a head taller than me
I'm from Norway
They have paved the on-ramp
Who is she talking about?
Where would you rather go?
I don't believe that at all
He wasn't cooperative
Are they together again?
Dolphins don't have gills
Whales don't have gills
We aren't disappointed
I don't scare them
I'm traveling to Spain
I can't be sure Tom will help
Ham or turkey?
Neither one, I'm vegan
He's eating breakfast now
Your wife isn't unfaithful
I've never eaten Chinese food
What do you feel now?
Yeah, it's looking great!
She's beautiful enough
We don't need to stay there
Skånska has a hard r-sound
It's a boy
You don't have a life jacket
Is the water cold?
What are we eating for dinner?
Who was it that called me?
What is tolerance?
Which songs did they sing?
Who gave that to you?
Some man.
I can't find you
What is biokinesis?
But what will justify the end?
She didn't agree with him
You ripped me off!
What a dummy!
I forgot my keys!
I'm not going to seduce her
Don't ever call gays "fags
I don't want to date a whore
You see?
I don't want to do this
Do you think Mary is innocent?
Do you think she's innocent?
Do you think he's innocent?
I didn't like that game
You still haven't learned yet
I'm Ukrainian
I'm going to my sister's
I'm going over to my sister's
She's white
Give me the car keys, please
Can I hold your baby?
Do you want to hold my baby?
Do you want to hold my dog?
I'll try to change their minds
Whose glasses are those?
Hers.
I'm working on my new book
What is true love?
What is in your hands?
Is this a new photo?
Happy birthday, Muriel!
Why is everyone so mean to me?
Why are people so mean to me?
Let's make Tatoeba great again
Is your neighbour sexy?
Is your father rich?
Is your house big?
Is your sister married?
Eat your soup, please
How long were you there?
I was there for two days.
I'm happy in here
I'm a very careful person
What will we do about it?
We close at 7 p.m
You don't need to lie
I'm interested in buying it
Stop wasting everyone's time
The pain wouldn't go away
Tom and Mary haven't come yet
Mary hasn't come yet
He's forcing me to decide
Next year I'm going to America
It's not about me
It's not so bad!
Are you glad about the result?
How many eggs did mammy buy?
I'm learning Irish
I don't know!
We will close around 7 p.m
We're closing around 7 p.m
Is your car comfortable?
That store sells kitchen-ware
She doesn't seem very modest
Do you want a refill?
I'm bursting with curiosity
He's known to appear sluggish
Please!
Please!
Let's eat grandma!
Let's eat, grandma!
Who is this brat?
I can't install that
She's a honey!
Look at those curves!
Don't you know her name?
Can you speak a little slower?
I couldn't rest
Mary couldn't rest
Tom couldn't rest
Plants can't grow without air
No one loves you, Tom
No one loves you, Mary
Do you have a sister?
Who is she?
You don't even try that hard
Could you please fix this?
Do you think you can fix this?
Tom's license has been revoked
Tom's troubles aren't over yet
How could this happen to Tom?
Doesn't Tom have any friends?
Where could Tom possibly be?
Tom's parents weren't happy
Tom wouldn't do it this way
Tom shouldn't be here today
Tom's troubles aren't over
Tom's car is in the garage
Tom's behavior has changed
Tom is really good-looking
Could you fix this, please?
Fuck you, asshole
I'm not defending that idiot
It's a mess
Get a job!
Did you have lunch after me?
It's so stupidly easy
Can you pay attention?
Don't be a piece of shit
That doesn't fly with me
Fuck, what a pity!
How lucky!
She’s not all there
We're fixing it up
We don't take any prisoners
I'm already stressed out
It's mediocre
I'm fucking pissed
I'm so pissed off
He shouldn't have blown a fuse
Suck my dick!
Get ready and let’s go!
I'm just hanging around
Chill out!
Dude, that really happened!
He's cheap
We're going to the bar
We're going to the discotheque
What a horrible smell!
What you said didn't happen
He's ugly
She's vulgar
She's bad
I’m going to kick his butt
I’m going to kick his ass
Don't be a cocksucker
He's a fake
She's a fake
Don't be a troll
He's a wanker
You son of a bitch!
You shithead!
Hell no!
You’re fucking with me
What a cheapskate!
I've lost my wallet
I'm pissed!
There's no alcohol
He isn't handsome
Don't trust that realtor
He's evil
He's unbearable
She's very shallow
You gotta win that debate!
I'll do it right away!
He's a very good friend
It's 5 something
Don't get that
It's not the best quality
I'm in a shitty mood
There's nothing more to add
Show it to us!
Why do you want to go away?
Does he want to go away?
Does she want to go away?
Lighten up!
I don't like or dislike it
When will the trees blossom?
You're safe if I'm with you
What did Socrates write about?
What did Tom write about?
You'll be safe if I'm with you
We're pretty pleased with that
We're not looking for sympathy
That's the way it is sometimes
That's the number one priority
That's the most important part
That's our number one priority
I'll do it right away
That's exactly what it's about
That's a whole different story
That's a very compelling story
It didn't make much difference
You'd probably really like it
Will that make any difference?
Why was everyone so surprised?

It's been challenging
It's a real challenge
That's a challenge
It's a challenge
Well, that changes everything
Tom's attitude has changed
They've changed the rules
Hopefully, that'll change
Are you willing to change?
You don't have to change
What changed their minds?
What a refreshing change!
Nothing's really changed
Will this change things?
What else should change?
So will anything change?
Have your goals changed?
Why should they change?
Will that ever change?
Why did things change?
I hope that'll change
How might that change?
Has something changed?
Can we change history?
It was life-changing
What can be changed?
That'll change soon
I don't like change
That'll change now
What can I change?
What'll change?
Who stole my battery charger?
Is the battery fully charged?
Tom won't be in charge
Why do people cheat?
That's easy enough to check
You'd better check that
Everyone's cheering
We don't have to choose
Who chose those colors?
Why was Tom chosen?
Why is everyone clapping?
Let's keep our beaches clean
That's clearly not a priority
Clearly, that wasn't the case
Clearly, that wasn't enough
Clearly, that was a mistake
Is the procedure clear?
Clearly, I was wrong
We can't do both
It wasn't that close
Is the coach frustrated?
Who was the coach?
I'm not the coach
Tom will come again, I'm sure
Tom came to Boston in 2013
Tom came home at 2:30
We know they'll come
Tom's turn came
It's a huge commitment
How will we communicate?
What a ridiculous comparison!
Customers haven't complained
Why are you complaining?
We aren't complaining
We didn't complain
Now it's completely different
What a complete failure!
It's a complicated transaction
It's not very complicated
They won't compromise with us
What a ridiculous concept!
Should I be concerned?
It's a huge concern
That's the concern
Is that a concern?
Who conducts the tests?
That couldn't be confirmed
Can anyone confirm that?
It wasn't confusing at all
Isn't that confusing?
Are you confused yet?
Are you confused now?
No one's confused
Are they confused?
Tom couldn't be contacted
Hopefully, that can continue
Will those trends continue?
I have a three-year contract
Did you sign a contract?
Don't contradict your teacher
How can you contribute?
Are you still not convinced?
Who do we have to convince?
Does that sound convincing?
Tom couldn't be convinced
Is that already cooked?
Tom can't cook
How did you cope?
Is this report correct?
Tom is 100% correct
What exactly will it cost?
How much do these cost?
What'll it cost me?
What was the cost?
However, I could be wrong
I could be wrong, though
You could've told me the truth
The timing couldn't be better
I tried, but I couldn't do it
The timing couldn't be worse
Tom said he couldn't recall
Could you wrap this for me?
Could we start immediately?
Could the situation worsen?
I wish we could've helped
They couldn't be stopped
Could this really happen?
Tom couldn't be reached
Tom couldn't be located
Could you rephrase that?
I couldn't be a doctor
Could you wait outside?
We couldn't stop them
Tom couldn't be saved
That couldn't be true
Could it happen today?
That couldn't happen
Could we have waited?
How could I refuse?
Tom could've died
What could we do?
Could it happen?
Does their opinion count?
I cried, too
Has Tom's dancing improved?
What an awesome deal!
It's a huge deal
You're the one who must decide
You're the leader
Who will ultimately decide?
That's for you to decide
We've already decided
It's very demanding work
Tom denied Mary's requests
Do you deny that?
Do you have dependents?
Is that depressing?
Tom died in Boston in 2013
Tom died October 20, 2013
Nobody should've died
Will anyone be disappointed?
Why were you disappointed?
That's a disappointment
Boy, was I disappointed
I'll be disappointed
What a great discovery!
We're still discussing that
Whatever you do, don't do that
There's no point in doing that
I just don't think they get it
I don't have a Twitter account
I didn't have to go, but I did
I didn't fathom this happening
You don't have to be a genius
Why don't we collaborate more?
What's Tom doing this weekend?
What size shoes does Tom wear?
We don't have enough data yet
We don't have a choice, do we?
We didn't go as far as Boston
Tom shouldn't have to do that
It didn't have to be this way
I should've done this earlier
I don't have to sell my house
I didn't realize we were late
I can't do anything right now
How much food do we have left?
Do you think Tom will show up?
Do you have a better solution?
Do we have a contingency plan?
Didn't you have a reservation?
We don't need a lot of space
Tom said that he didn't know
Tom didn't want to kiss Mary
This doesn't make much sense
There's no reason to do that
That's relatively easy to do
Please don't feed the monkey
Please don't do that anymore
I don't speak French at home
I don't remember saying that
I don't have any pain at all
How long do you want to stay?
Does Tom want us to help him?
Do you have a valid passport?
Did you stay home last night?
Why don't you give it a try?
Where did this custom start?
When did Tom live in Boston?
What did Tom wear yesterday?
What did Tom Jackson invent?
We don't require much space
We don't have time to waste
Tom said he didn't know why
Tom doesn't have a basement
There's no point doing that
That usually doesn't happen
That doesn't matter, really
That doesn't have to happen
That doesn't happen anymore
I don't have a road map yet
However, that didn't happen
Don't be afraid to speak up
Doesn't that sound romantic?
Does anything look familiar?
Do you think you're likable?
Do you still have questions?
Did they have a backup plan?
Why did you open that door?
When did this custom start?
We don't have that anymore
We didn't have that option
Tom doesn't have a website
Tom didn't have permission
Tom didn't even look at me
This didn't have to happen
That didn't have to happen
I know Tom doesn't love me
I don't think I'll do that
Do you think Tom trusts us?
Do you have kids in school?
Do you have any birthmarks?
Did you like Tom's concert?
Did somebody say something?
Who did you make this for?
We don't have enough food
Tom said he was done, too
Tom doesn't respect women
Tom doesn't have to worry
Tom doesn't have a salary
Tom doesn't have a prayer
Tom doesn't have a chance
Tom didn't have the money
Tom didn't even kiss Mary
This doesn't work anymore
They didn't have uniforms
They didn't have a prayer
They didn't have a choice
Should I help Tom do that?
Perhaps it doesn't matter
I guess it doesn't matter
I didn't actually see Tom
How did that occur to you?
Does their opinion matter?
Does that sounds familiar?
Does anybody remember Tom?
Does Tom play tennis well?
Do you have a backup plan?
Did you make any mistakes?
Did you go skinny-dipping?
Did anything surprise you?
Will Tom want to do that?
Who did Tom do that with?
What exactly do you need?
What exactly did we miss?
What do Tom's parents do?
We shouldn't do anything
We don't have to be here
We don't have that right
We don't have a toboggan
We don't have a timeline
We don't have a solution
Was what Tom did a crime?
Tom said he didn't smoke
Tom didn't have a weapon
Tom didn't go to Harvard
They don't have a choice
They don't have a chance
It'll be easy to do that
I don't want any excuses
I don't like Tom's voice
I didn't have much water
I didn't have much money
How often do you see Tom?
Does this sound horrible?
Does that sound romantic?
Does Tom have a passport?
Did people recognize you?
Did Tom show an interest?
Who should've done that?
Who did Tom do that for?
Where does this path go?
When does college start?
What did you experience?
What can Tom do to help?
We don't have the space
We don't have that data
We don't have any water
We didn't have a chance
Tom didn't wash his car
It doesn't hurt anymore
It doesn't happen often
I don't have a mortgage
I don't have a headache
I didn't have much time
I didn't click the link
How did Tom offend Mary?
How did Tom get injured?
Don't be such a crybaby
Does faith healing work?
Does everybody need one?
Does Tom have blue eyes?
Do you have earrings on?
Do you have a generator?
Do you have a birthmark?
Can anyone else do that?
Why don't you have one?
Why don't you have any?
When does spring start?
We haven't done enough
Tom still doesn't know
Tom doesn't have one
Tom doesn't have a dad
Please don't be fooled
I'd rather not do that
I don't like Tom's dog
I don't have a printer
I don't have a firearm
How well does Tom swim?
How is everybody doing?
Does anyone have a map?
Does Tom still wrestle?
Does Tom have a chance?
Does Tom follow soccer?
Do you hear that sound?
Do you have experience?
Do you have a passport?
Do you ever wonder why?
You know I don't mind
Who doesn't like that?
When do classes start?
What does this matter?
What do people expect?
We didn't tell anyone
Tom didn't have a job
I don't have the ball
I didn't have a phone
Does that sound weird?
Do you want the truth?
Do you have insurance?
Why don't you try it?
Why does that matter?
Where do we register?
What does this prove?
What did Tom do next?
They don't have jobs
They don't have fuel
That's for you to do
It wasn't easy to do
I didn't have a clue
How does this happen?
Don't skip this step
Don't feed the ducks
Does Tom play tennis?
Does Tom feel guilty?
Do you like shopping?
Do you hear bagpipes?
Do they really exist?
Did this just happen?
Did that happen here?
Did Tom yell at Mary?
You don't have time
Who did they survey?
When did you finish?
What did you forget?
Is this worth doing?
I didn't have a key
How does this sound?
Has Tom done enough?
Does this seem fair?
Do you watch soccer?
Do the windows open?
Did you learn a lot?
Did you follow them?
Why don't you move?
Why didn't you run?
Why did this occur?
Who else does this?
Who did you offend?
Who did the survey?
What do you prefer?
What did Tom drink?
We're done waiting
Should Tom do that?
Please don't leave
How does this help?
How did that occur?
Don't be surprised
Does Tom know that?
Does Tom know Mary?
Do you really know?
Do you like horses?
Do you like flying?
Do you eat octopus?
Did Tom say thanks?
Where do you shop?
What has Tom done?
What do they need?
What did you take?
What did Tom wear?
What did Tom sing?
What did Tom make?
Tom did that, too
I don't have that
How do we survive?
How did that feel?
Does Tom work out?
Do you eat salads?
Do they have jobs?
Do the doors lock?
Did we get better?
Did Tom mean that?
Can anybody do it?
Why does it work?
Who do you trust?
Who did Tom help?
When do you shop?
What must you do?
What did Tom see?
What did Tom eat?
That didn't help
I didn't have it
How is that done?
How does it help?
How do you relax?
Do you ever rest?
Do they like you?
Do they get paid?
Did you eat well?
Can they do this?
Why do you blog?
Why do this now?
Who did Tom hit?
Did Tom go, too?
I didn't leave
Can I do this?
Did Tom sing?
It's a good dream
That's the dream
What were they drinking?
What were you drinking?
Has Tom quit drinking?
How drunk was Tom?
You're a horrible driver
I've never eaten horse meat
Have you been eating enough?
What were they eating?
What was Tom eating?
Would you eat this?
What'll you eat?
Tom was re-elected
What an embarrassment!
Tom is a self-employed plumber
I have 13 employees
Will this ever end?
When will this end?
After graduating, Tom enlisted
I've updated the blog entry
We're entitled to the facts
It's an exciting proposition
What an exciting experience!
It'll be exciting
Tom's behavior was inexcusable
Tom was executed in 2013
Why is exercise important?
Tom said that's to be expected
Tom wasn't expecting visitors
What are the expectations?
Tom knows what's expected
What should we expect?
That's to be expected
It's too hard to explain
Can someone explain this?
I looked at Tom's face
Can Tom handle failure?
They're petrified with fear
I'm fed up with your attitude
We have kids we can't feed
I haven't felt any pain so far
I'm feeling better today
Are you feeling OK today?
Is Tom feeling well?
Who are we fighting?
You've figured it out, I think
Have you figured it out?
I've figured it out
Who authorized the filming?
Finally, it was time
Finally, it was over
Were any weapons found?
I can't find Tom
We haven't finished
They finished 13th
Were warning shots fired?
Tom shouldn't be fired
Will anyone be fired?
Have you been fired?
When was Tom fired?
Can we fish there?
Who gave you these flowers?
Who are these flowers for?
I'm afraid of flying
What a foolish suggestion!
What a foolish statement!
Tom is a pig-headed fool
Who looks foolish now?
How foolish of you!
I've forgotten Tom's last name
I've forgotten your last name
I've gained three pounds
It's a huge gamble
Every year, the pain got worse
You've got to start somewhere
When will we get to Boston?
Volunteers get a T-shirt
Have you gotten yours?
Who got nominated?
It's gotten worse
Who should I give this to?
Who gave you this list?
I'm going out with Tom tonight
Tom says he's going to resign
If Tom goes, I'll go with him
I'll go to Boston next summer
Tom's going with me tomorrow
I can't go with you tomorrow
You went to Harvard, right?
Tom is the easy-going sort
Is Tom going to dump Mary?
We're going to visit Tom
Tom went to Mary's house
Tom goes to work at 7:30
Is everything going OK?
Will they go together?
Let's all go to Tom's
What went wrong here?
Tom was a go-getter
Where will Tom go?
Is Tom going home?
Is Tom going mad?
Let's go, Tom
Grab the shovels, boys
I'm a Harvard graduate
Tom would've grinned
What was that groan for?
Tom writes left-handed
How are complaints handled?
Hang in there, guys
Hopefully, that won't happen
That's not likely to happen
Tom said that won't happen
That wouldn't happen today
There's nothing happening
That'll happen eventually
What happened in October?
What happened afterwards?
What should happen next?
What happens after that?
That won't happen today
Is that still happening?
Will that happen again?
What on earth happened?
What happens this week?
What happened that day?
Why would this happen?
What happened in 2013?
That happened in 2013
Has that happened yet?
Can this happen again?
Will it happen again?
What really happened?
That hasn't happened
Let's make it happen
It'll happen tonight
What happened there?
It happened in 2013
How can that happen?
What'll happen now?
Can it happen here?
What'll happen?
Who else hates Tom?
Tom's dog hated me
Where was Tom heading?
Can everyone hear me?
Preheat the oven to 300°F
Can you help me tie this tie?
Of course, Tom will help us
Would a postponement help?
Can you help, please?
Can you please help?
Can anyone help out?
We'd like to help
Tom can't help me
Should I help Tom?
How can kids help?
How might I help?
Can you help out?
Would $300 help?
Who can help me?
Are they hiding something?
Should we hire Tom?
I hope that you aren't serious
I was hoping I'd see you here
See you soon, I hope
I hope you're joking
I'm glad the kids weren't hurt
I'm glad you weren't hurt
Nobody's been hurt
That must've hurt
You're kidding me, right?
That can't be true
Tom isn't my boyfriend
We're just friends
My shoes are bigger than Tom's
I'm looking forward to tonight
I'd rather stay here in Boston
I won't retract that statement
I want at least a 30% discount
I haven't talked to Tom at all
I've already read this report
I'd rather stay home with you
I'd like to lose a few pounds
I've worked with Tom before
Tom's attitude infuriates me
Tom said he'd never leave me
That's not really my problem
I've already seen this movie
I'm parked across the street
I want one, but not this one
The boat isn't where I left
My name's Tom
What's yours?
I'm thrilled the Giants won
I understand Tom's position
I purchased Tom's new novel
Where are my grandchildren?
Tell me why Tom isn't here
Now I have a headache, too
My idea is better, I think
May I speak to Tom, please?
If Tom wins, I'll be happy
I wasn't really interested
I said that it wasn't true
I haven't learned much yet
I'm a freshman at Harvard
I think it's unreasonable
I talked to Tom's parents
Why shouldn't I be happy?
I'll be forever grateful
I won't be there tonight
I understand Tom's point
I think it's disgraceful
I think everybody's here
I have a 13-year-old son
Obviously, I was scared
I'm still not impressed
I'm lucky to have a job
I'm a preschool teacher
I'll write Tom a letter
I won't be in this week
I was scared, of course
I used to like Tom, too
I love Tom's enthusiasm
Why can't I have a dog?
I've already seen this
I'm a sailor, you know
I think it's hilarious
I should've phoned Tom
My mom's the greatest
I've said this before
I've said that before
I'm in pain every day
I wasn't even nervous
How can I participate?
Who should I talk to?
My dad's name is Tom
Luckily, I was wrong
I'm in love with Tom
I'm friends with Tom
I'd rather stay home
I worried, of course
I was 13 at the time
Can I speak with Tom?
Where are my gloves?
I'm traveling alone
I'm still skeptical
I'm bored with that
I was outraged, too
I took Tom's advice
I think they'll win
I think it's simple
Boy, was I mistaken
I'm the supervisor
I wasn't surprised
I was nervous, too
I thought that, too
I think it's wrong
I remember it, too
I love Tom's voice
I know Tom's upset
Hi, my name is Tom
Are my children OK?
Where will I live?
That's OK with me
I'm a soldier now
I think it's cool
Will you miss me?
When can I train?
Is this my fault?
I'm not the boss
I'm a hockey fan
I'm a Giants fan
I was there, too
Boy, was I wrong
I'm fond of Tom
You'll be mine
What'll I need?
Is this for me?
I've been good
They can't be ignored
What are your impressions?
Tom wasn't very impressed
What was your impression?
What impressed you most?
You'll be impressed
Has Tom's painting improved?
Conditions haven't improved
Has the situation improved?
Has Tom's French improved?
What can be improved?
What are your influences?
Tom and Mary weren't injured
How many were injured?
When was Tom injured?
Tom wasn't injured
No one's injured
What an inspiration!
Is it easy to install?
Tom simply wasn't interested
We know you're interested
What kept you interested?
Now, this is interesting
It'll be interesting
It's a good investment
There's nothing to investigate
Has Tom been invited?
Was the FBI involved?
You'd better keep working
We'll keep you posted
Keep it up, guys
We haven't even kissed
Who's knocking on the door?
Everyone knows it's true
It's simple, you know
It's public knowledge
Who really knows why?
Who knows for sure?
Who really knows?
Why are Tom and Mary laughing?
Why is everyone laughing?
We need Tom's leadership
Tom's a fantastic leader
Can Tom retake the lead?
What have you learned, Tom?
There's plenty of time left
Tom shouldn't have left
Tom should've left
Let's talk about somebody else
Let's take a trip to Australia
Let's ponder that for a moment
Let's stop talking about this
Let's not pretend otherwise
Let's listen to some jazz
Let's sit somewhere else
Let's have a contest
Let's stop this now
Let's be serious
It was a lie, of course
Why would they lie?
Is Tom still lying?
What lies ahead?
Lighten up, guys
We shouldn't be on the list
Why isn't Tom on this list?
Everyone should've listened
Is the audience listening?
Tom, are you listening?
Is everybody listening?
Was anybody listening?
Is anybody listening?
Is anyone listening?
How long has Tom lived here?
Where are they living now?
Where are they living?
Where will they live?
Is Tom still living?
That's no longer true
It's a long journey
You'd better take another look
What specifically looks wrong?
Tom's children all look alike
What a weird-looking place!
What are they looking at?
So far, we've lost three games
We've lost our funding
How can they lose?
What a bad loser!
You would've loved Tom
We've made way too many errors
Who made those policies?
What makes them special?
What made this possible?
Who makes the schedule?
Who made this possible?
Who made that decision?
Are we making progress?
Have we made progress?
Who made these pots?
How is whiskey made?
We're making money
Where was it made?
You're a mean-spirited man
What a nice man!
It's a crazy market
It's a personnel matter
Should that matter?
What can that mean?
Have you already met Tom?
We've just met
What are your memories?
Tom was Mary's mentor
Is Tom your mentor?
Is this milk still good?
Will you miss Tom?
What a terrible mistake!
Boy, was that a mistake
That's a huge mistake
That wasn't a mistake
It wasn't a mistake
Tom's success motivated us
Was that a smart move?
Is that someone's name?
What was her name?
We need Tom's experience
We'll need your support
What are Tom's needs?
We need Tom's money
Is it truly needed?
What'll you need?
Is this normal behavior?
Who would notice?
That's a huge number
How can this occur?
The deadline is 2:30 on Monday
What are our thoughts on this?
What's on the agenda today?
There's trash on the floor
Why isn't Tom on the team?
Can you elaborate on that?
Were you on the train?
We're right on track
Shame on you, Tom
We opened this store in 2013
Tom is open-minded
Why was there opposition?
Who ordered this?
What have we overlooked?
How was that overlooked?
What'll you pack?
Where should we park?
What part is wrong?
That's partly true
Tom shouldn't be paid
It's a paid position
We pay Tom's salary
Who paid for that?
Tom won't be paid
We're striving for perfection
Is this permissible?
Where are the photos?
Tom's pitching was outstanding
See you at Tom's place
What a great place!
Tom's plan worked brilliantly
Tom's plan actually worked
Luckily, we have a plan
You have a plan, right?
Is this plan feasible?
Will the plan work?
Can you still play tennis?
Where can the kids play?
It's hard to please Tom
Next question, please
Speak up, please
Tom scored 30 points
That isn't the point
Tom retweeted Mary's post
Tom weighs 130 pounds
What are your predictions?
Are we that predictable?
You'd better be prepared
How should we proceed?
It's quite a project
Have you been promoted?
What would you propose?
Is Tom protecting someone?
Why are they protesting?
Why was Tom punished?
Who's being punished?
Who authorized this purchase?
Is this worth pursuing?
What are their qualifications?
What an absurd question!
Why should Tom quit?
How many races have you won?
It's not easy raising children
Who raised these pigs?
It's a first-rate hospital
How will Tom react?
Aren't you being unreasonable?
Is that reasonable behavior?
And here's the reason
Tom received 333 votes
Is that a recommendation?
It's public record
Fortunately, Tom recovered
Registration starts at 2:30
Where should we register?
What's you're biggest regret?
Are you in a relationship?
Are Tom and Mary related?
Are they related?
Tom's blindfold was removed
This shouldn't be repeated
Who will replace Tom?
Can you replace Tom?
Can it be replaced?
When was the theft reported?
Here's today's report
What an awful report!
Here's the report
Tickets aren't required
Is animal research ethical?
Why should Tom resign?
If you're tired, rest
Were the results surprising?
Was the result surprising?
Tom retired October 20, 2013
Tom retired in 2013
Has Tom already returned?
Hasn't Tom returned yet?
Why should Tom return?
Who rang the bell?
Rise and shine, sleepyhead
Everybody's at risk
The movie ran 85 minutes
Why are you in a rush?
Tom said it wasn't serious
Tom said he wasn't worried
Tom said he wasn't in pain
Tom said it wasn't funny
Tom hasn't said anything
Tom says he's tone deaf
Tom said he wasn't sure
What are people saying?
Tom said he isn't sure
Say it isn't true
Tom wasn't scared of anything
Why were you so scared?
Tom wasn't wearing a seat belt
Are our borders secure?
Tom, you should see this
We've seen enough
They've stopped selling those
What are they selling?
Why was Tom sent home?
Dinner will be served at 6:30
Others share Tom's optimism
It was a shock, to be sure
Tom shot Mary in self-defense
Are these shots necessary?
What a great shot!
Why are you shouting?
What an incredible show!
The show starts at 2:30
Was Tom showing off?
What a great show!
That's a very positive sign
It's simple, but it works

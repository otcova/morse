I don't think that it's over
I don't think that it's good
I don't think that it's fair
I don't think that it's cold
I don't think that Tom is up
I don't think that Tom is in
I don't think that Tom cares
I don't think that Tom cared
I don't think that I'm wrong
I don't think that I'm alone
I don't think that I'll lose
I don't think that it's odd
I don't think that it's Tom
I don't think that it helps
I don't think that Tom lied
It's too expensive
I don't feel any pressure
I don't really have a job
I don't want to miss that
I don't want to stop here
I don't want you to do it
I wasn't on the right bus
I wouldn't say no to that
I'd rather be watching TV
I don't want to hurt you
I'm excited about this project
It didn't seem to bother him
It didn't seem to bother her
How did she get involved?
How did he get involved?
How did you get involved?
Tom didn't make the cut
How did you find out about us?
You're living in the past!
Tom's eyes were red
Mary's eyes were red
What happened to ancient Rome?
Any word from Tom?
Could you explain it again?
I'm too old
I don't think anyone knows yet
I don't think I know that girl
I don't think I know that man
I don't think I know that guy
I don't think I know that boy
I don't think anybody saw us
I don't think that I can do it
I don't think that I need one
I don't think that I like you
I don't think that I know you
I don't think that I know Tom
I don't think that I hurt Tom
I don't think that I can stay
I don't think that I can move
I don't think that I like it
I don't think that I follow
Are you guys going to be OK?
Tom isn't easily offended
I suspect Tom wasn't surprised
I suspect you won't like it
I suspect that you're wrong
I suspect that you're right

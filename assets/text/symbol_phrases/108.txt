I'm the happiest man on Earth!
Why should I listen to you?
You'll do it today right?
Was it interesting?
It's a lot of fun
We've got a problem
Do you come here often?
What is the number?
What is that thing?
Which one is good?
Who will do it?
This is the one I'll use
What did you drink?
When will it be good?
Which one is broken?
Who is coming?
Let's go to the club
I have a test today, too
I am going, too
Do you have any more big ones?
Please don't use English
Can you speak Japanese, too?
Isn't it a bit small?
How many do you need?
Is that all you have?
Don't look over there
How can you stand it?
We still can't see it
Did you like that?
Where are the satellites?
How far away are we?
Who would have dared?
Can you explain it to me?
Don't call us, we'll call you
In the room, all was silent
I couldn't do that either
Again, a thousand apologies
I'll show you where
It's quite possible
Who are these people?
It's wonderful!
Exactly, my dear
I won't do it again
They didn't seem to notice it
What is the age of the oldest?
Do you know?
Did they understand?
Had I said something stupid?
No, I think you misunderstand
Who died and made you king?
Oh please, not so fast
How far are we from it?
I don't like the way you look
Don't give me that sour look
I don't like your behavior
Jack isn't there
What a terrible establishment!
I'll be back later
Follow your sister's example
Darn it!
Where is the bus stop?
I'll take a steak
How could I know?
Where do they do that at?
Where were they going?
It's all right for now
Is that music I hear?
It is restful, isn't it?
Come, let me show you around
Am I safe here?
Where are the children?
Well, it was different
What's the historian's duty?
There's someone at the door
When did you arrive in China?

Yes, you may.
He can't have lost his keys
When he arrived, I made coffee
I've got married ten years ago
When shall we meet again?
When will we meet again?
She doesn't have any brothers
I don't drink that much beer
Why do people kill themselves?
Has he given up cigarettes?
I'm starting to bleed
Please, I'm all ears!
I'm the king of the world!
Get lost!
I can't get over it
Ah, okay!
Languages aren't his forte
Hello, are you well?
I'll call you
I'll give you a call
I'm on the go
I still haven't done it
How is this explained?
What happened to me?
Is the rat alive or dead?
Allah rocks!
It's a little farther ahead
Do you want a punch?
It doesn't hurt
It won't hurt
I'll wait here until she comes
How was it at your birthday?
That boy doesn't eat candies
That boy doesn't eat
You're watching AnnoZero, eh?
What will it be of us?
But what do you want?
I'd like to buy some stickers
Don't you get bored at scouts?
We don't have much time

This evening I'd stay at home
I'm sure that he'll succeed

I'll never forget meeting you
I'll remember you forever
I won't go skating today
Dogs can't tell colors apart
He didn't do any work
Let's go away
It isn't a real apartment
It isn't a true apartment
Do you know the value of fear?
Who is the owner of this car?
Correct!
It's true!
Chapeau!
She's way taller than me
Can you bring me up to speed?
I'm still not really happy
It's familiar to me
I want to go to my bed!
I'm playing with my computer
We're almost like brothers
We're just like brothers
I'm thinking of you
I love you, too
I want to go to bed!
Can you explain the way to me?
Don't kid me!
Where did it happen?
We're out of stock
My condolences!
Our condolences!
They're related to each other
Could you oil them please?
All our wishes of happiness!
A cup of coffee, please
Do you hear the birds singing?
Oh, you, oh!
Come, we must go now
See you tonight!
See you soon!
Do you have a solution?
What time do you open?
One cup of coffee, please
How do you do that?
We'll show you the way
Give me back my husband!
I'll move soon

I'm in the sixth form
You can count yourself lucky!
May I give you some advice?
We didn't talk yesterday
Do you speak Turkish?

That's all she wrote
What do you make of it?
Way to go!

I'll boil the potatoes for you
He did not go out, he sat down
Enough already!
He is loved by many, isn't he?
Yes, he is.

Wanna go karaoke?
Sorry, later.
Do I have to write in ink?
Oh, onion bagels
Well?

Seen my cell phone?
On the table!

Have you seen my cell phone?
It's on the table.
That's cheap, isn't it?
Then who?
I will arrive on 23rd of May
To win, and we will win!
Get well soon!
Whatever I do is always wrong!
It'll lock by itself
That doesn't surprise me
No water, no life
I wonder what he's doing..
It's already 7 o'clock
Is it good news?
It's hot as hell!
I don't give a shit
It's already 7:00
I've found it
Bye!
He's on the way to go
I didn't read it all
Do what's right!
I'm alive in Tokyo
Was there enough money?
Let's turn off the TV
Let's turn off the television
Trust me, I've been there
I'm scared of killing animals
Stop that!
Give it back!
Don't underestimate me
There's no free lunch
I'm sorry to be so late
A little pride maybe?
Your O's look like A's
If anyone can do it, you can
He doesn't belong to us
Did you find your book?
He's not in our group
He's not one of us
I've slept well all night
He peeps, he farts, the pope
Get outta here!
Not again!
Look at that girl!
You won't feel me
I like it, too
How are you?
I'm a little crazy
Don't pay attention to him
Don't twist my words around
I've saved the best for last
That's enough for today
I'm tired
Oh yeah?
Wanna play this game?
I'm as healthy as a horse
To where does this road lead?
I'm reading The New York Times
I hope it is cooler now!
That's water under the bridge
I can't speak Klingon
Do you speak Klingon?
Why is he angry?
I'd like to try skydiving
They are peace-loving people
Where are my keys?
You can't or you won't?
I'm really hung over
I don't speak any Klingon
Watch out!
There's a pothole in the road
Is there a drugstore nearby?
Did you talk to your wife?
Work quickly, eat slowly
One can't play baseball here
It's my fault
Is this store open on Sundays?
What time does the store open?
I'd like a fish
Where shall we go now?
To the theatre or cinema?
I'm really into football
Do you still need my help?
Don't tase me, bro!
Who does this belong to?
I don't want to live alone
It breaks my heart!
If you hurry, you can make it
Maybe it'll rain soon
Astounding, isn't it?
Shall we add a bit more salt?
We've just cleaned the toilets
Let's come back to it later
Are you like her?
What does it actually mean?
Who am I?
How did I come to be?
I'll never forget to meet you
Don't cast pears before swine
Spirit, are you there?
I'd like to see her again
I'd like to see them again
He lived in Spain, I think
She's the village bike
She's the local slut
He's giving it a go
The bike's mine
The phone's ringing
I'll get it if you want
Is it love?
He's not a doctor
My back teeth are floating..
Who will come with us?
Who did you write a letter to?
Which eye is hurting you?
Which brother did you see?
December has thirty-one days
I can't sleep at all
The price isn't important
Do you want soup?
Do you want to sleep?
What do you want to say?
Words fly, texts remain
Two souls, one spirit
Oh, sweet name of freedom!
I'm not coming along
I can't think of anything
What do you want from me?
What's wrong with you?
You're crazy!
What about you?

She's a blonde girl
I'll show you my new car
You can't tickle yourself
Cut him some slack, John
It's his first day on the job
What do you want?
She swims, but does not sink

We've decided to remain silent
It's none of your business!
This is a house of crazies!
What have you done this week?
So now it's my turn
Tom can't swim yet
What can I help you with?
Don't hate me!
Let's stop playing tennis
Spring sows, autumn reaps
We don't know the truth yet
Ladies first!
It's my fault, not yours
I won't see her anymore
More kids, more hands
It's not as bad as it sounds
Truth isn't
When angry, count to four
When very angry, swear
Why not go out on a limb?
That's where the fruit is
I'm ashamed!
Where are you bound?
Where are you heading?
Where do they do that?
It's all in a day's work
Time's up
Yikes, we are in the soup now!
What the hell?
Keep your mouth shut!
How heavy you are!
Is this your sack or his?
Is this your sack or hers?

Is she sleeping?
What bustle in the streets!
And then, the boy did that
I couldn't sleep all night
I don't have any enemies
What a nice idea!
Do you really think so?
I know so.
That's his
No!
Did he really say that?
You can't be serious!
It was cold, so we lit a fire

You can't park your car here
Really?!
Man, you're kidding right?

A man chooses; a slave obeys
Don't drop that glass
What is it all about?
It doesn't matter!
Could you lend me some money?
Hey boys, stop fighting
Come on, break it up!
Let's get cracking!
Here we go!
I'll certainly do this
Are you pulling my leg?
A truthful politician?

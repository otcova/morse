Who will start?
You can't fire me, I quit!
The fewer words, the better
Tom's hair is neatly combed
What are you doing later?
Tom's dog died yesterday

I suppose you can do that, too
These apples didn't cost much
Isn't Tom a friend of yours?
We're getting ready to do that
I don't think that that's true
Tom didn't know how to swim
I don't think you should leave
Tom didn't see anybody else
Tom didn't want Mary's help
How's the apple?
You can't trust anything I say
I lie all the time, even now
I don't believe you can do it
I don't believe he can do it
I don't believe she can do it
I don't believe they can do it
I don't believe we can do it
Can anything make you happy?
Can anything make her happy?

I don't know how to help
Please don't be so noisy
I think Tom is doing that, too
Don't drink too much wine
I thought Tom couldn't do that
I was afraid I'd lose you
I was at Tom's for a long time
I'm sure Tom won't forget Mary
If Tom asks me to stay, I will
Are these sunglasses yours?
I don't want any more cats
Orange is Tom's favorite color
I'll find a way to do that

Of course, I didn't do that
Maybe you shouldn't do that
I'm starting to feel sleepy
I'm starting to feel guilty

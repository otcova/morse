Don't risk it!
Don't talk nonsense
Don't tell the boss
Hang on tight!
Has anybody come?
Have you bought the tickets?
Have you got some money?
He admired his friend's work
He couldn't find the house
He didn't keep his appointment
He didn't show up
He doesn't allow interruptions
He doesn't appreciate favors
He doesn't obey his parents
He has corporal's stripes
He hit the bull's-eye
He lent me 30 pesos
He maintains that it's true
He wouldn't give in
He'll be married next Sunday
He's a crude man
He's a good man
He's a little tipsy
He's a man of importance
He's a real Spaniard
He's a reckless young fellow
He's a singing teacher
He's a very clever boy
He's a very disagreeable man
He's a very energetic person
He's a very zealous worker
He's a yes-man
He's always gossiping
He's always involved in scams
He's always joking
He's always scowling
He's dead-tired
He's found a new love
He's going blind
He's leaning on a cane
He's looking for a job
He's not at all stupid
He's on sentry duty
He's one of my in-laws
He's quick in his movements
He's rich rather than poor
He's shorter than his brother
He's thoroughly honest
He's up there waiting for you
He's very fond of reading
He's very fond of walking
He's very jealous of his wife
He's very studious
Hello there, what's new?
Here's your bill, sir
His hair's thin at the temples
How much do you bet?
Hurry up, child!
Hurry up, it's late
I can't find the keyhole
I don't approve of his conduct
I don't know what to depend on
I don't like his looks
I don't like his type
I don't like the heat
I don't say it without reason
I'll wait for you in here
I'm a great baseball fan
I'm amazed at his nerve
I'm amazed that you say that
I'm anxious to meet her
I'm certain he's coming
I'm certainly glad to see you
I'm going to mail this letter
I'm going to sleep on it
I'm in a jam
I'm not feeling very well
I'm out of breath
Is that clock going?
Is this good material?
It struck like a bombshell!
It was a well-aimed shot
It's a cargo ship
It's a new movie theater
It's a solvent firm
It's a town of 3,000 people
It's a very clear day
It's a very tiring job
It's a well-to-do family
It's about eleven o'clock
It's as clear as crystal
It's dirt-cheap
It's forbidden to carry arms
It's past the square
It's roasting in this room
It's the best film of the year
It's too far to walk
Let's drink to your health!
Let's encourage the players
Let's go downtown
Let's go that way
Let's go up
Let's play cards a while
Let's roast the chestnuts
Let's settle accounts
Let's take that chance
She's a rather pretty woman
Shut up!
You're talking too much
Son, don't be foolish!
That guy's very embittered
That way, please
That's a separate question
That's a very good car
The beer's very cold
The bill amounted to 400 pesos
The ship's hull is damaged
The station's near the hotel
The tea set isn't complete
The theater was jam-packed
There it is!
There's your friend
These colors don't match well
They're very cheerful people
They're very fond of him
They've adopted a new plan
They've fired him
They've increased the salaries
This collar's too tight
This cover doesn't fit
We can't leave any loose ends
We're going home by car
We're having a rainy spell
We're in a blind alley
Wet firewood doesn't burn well
What a dope!
What a heel!
What a horrible thing!
What a hot day!
What an attractive woman!
What are we having for supper?
What are you going to drink?
What street do you live on?
Coffee, tea, or mint water?
When he heard it, he jumped
Where can I buy a brush?
Where did you eat last night?
Why are you so quiet?
You can't go where I'm going
You'll be sorry for this
You'll understand it later on
I love you, baby
Just do it, god damn it
She's a kleptomaniac
I won't let you do it
Don't tell me what to do!
You'll never understand
She doesn't talk to us anymore
They don't talk to us anymore
I'm not telling you what to do
You can't do that!
What's the matter, Tom?
We're not in love
We're just good friends
Don't say another word
You won't get it that way
You want it, don't you?
Yes, I kissed him
Yes, I kissed him
So what?
Did you kiss him?
Yes, I kissed him.
Did you kiss her?
Yes, I kissed her.
We'll work it out
You're not thinking straight
He's not thinking straight
She's not thinking straight
He couldn't stop laughing
That's an order!
I can't live without a woman
Do you love your wife?
Do you really love your wife?
How does your wife look like?
Is your wife beautiful?
Is your wife tall?
How old is your wife?
Can your wife drive?
Is your wife Berber?
Is your wife good at cooking?
Does your wife work?
Where does your wife work?
What's your wife's job?
Does your wife have a cat?
Well, well, well
Does your wife like cats?
Do you help your wife at home?
Do you work at all?
Do you have any comments?
Now do you understand?
Why do you call me an angel?
Do you wear those shoes often?
It's not looking good
Please don't tell anyone!
Can't we keep this between us?
What were you thinking?
Sure, Tom, I understand
We can't tell anyone
Tom hasn't arrived yet
He's nuttier than a fruitcake
He's not going
She's not going
Red alert!
Tom isn't present
Tom isn't scared
Tom didn't object
Tom wasn't pleased
Tom's office called
Can I bring Tom?
Can I tell Tom?

Don't make Tom angry
Don't talk about Tom
Don't talk to Tom
Don't tell Tom that
Don't worry about Tom
Don't you agree, Tom?
Don't you like Tom?
You've had enough
I don't want to tell him
I don't want to tell her
This typewriter doesn't work
Don't drop the tray
Don't throw away those papers
It's a fierce bull
The soup's very hot
Your coat's dragging
Don't back up
There's a tree behind you
Don't come near me
You're filthy
Don't get excited
It's nothing
Don't rock in the chair
It's going to break
Don't walk so fast
We'll get there on time
I don't like this paper
It's too shiny
It's very fast
We're late already
It's slow
It's a serious matter
It's clogged
You're half asleep
From here, I can't see it
Don't touch that doorknob
Is there any zakuska?
Is there any appetizer?
Go over to Tom's
Has Tom arrived yet?
Has Tom been fired?
Has Tom been helpful?
Has Tom been informed?
Has Tom been there?
Has Tom mentioned Mary?
Has Tom noticed yet?
Has Tom said anything?
Has Tom seen this?
Have you called Tom?
Have you forgiven Tom?
Have you found Tom?

His name isn't Tom
His real name's Tom
How could Tom know?
How did Tom sleep?
How did Tom sound?
How does Tom feel?
How does Tom look?
How is Tom doing?
How old is Tom?
How was Tom murdered?
How's Tom handling it?
How's Tom holding up?
How's Tom this morning?
I called Tom's sister
I can't call Tom
I checked Tom's computer
I dialed Tom's number
I didn't ask Tom
I didn't find Tom
I didn't hurt Tom
I didn't mean Tom
I didn't need Tom
I don't hate Tom
I don't like Tom
I don't love Tom
I don't need Tom
I don't see Tom
I don't understand Tom
I need Tom's signature
I read Tom's diary
I saw Tom's file
I think it's Tom
I think that's Tom
I was Tom's secretary
I won't tell Tom
I'll bring Tom home
I'll dance with Tom
I'll deal with Tom
I'll go get Tom
I'll go tell Tom
I'll go to Tom
I'll go with Tom
I'll hire Tom tomorrow
I'll let Tom explain
I'll look after Tom
I'll need Tom's help
I'll ride with Tom
I'll speak to Tom
I'll stick with Tom
I'll wait for Tom
I'll work with Tom
I'm better than Tom
I'm emailing Tom now
I'm engaged to Tom
I'm furious with Tom
I'm here with Tom
I'm not arresting Tom
I'm not blaming Tom
I'm not dating Tom
I'm not involving Tom
I'm not Tom's mother
I'm not Tom's sister
I'm nothing like Tom
I'm on Tom's list
I'm responsible for Tom
I'm still seeing Tom
I'm sure Tom dreams
I'm taking Tom home
I'm talking about Tom
I'm talking to Tom
I'm Tom's case manager
I'm Tom's new assistant
I'm Tom's new secretary
I'm Tom's older brother
I'm totally over Tom
I'm upset about Tom
I'm waiting for Tom
I'm with Tom now
I've always trusted Tom
Tom's reply surprised Mary
I've come for Tom
I've got Tom's keys
I've just seen Tom
I've never met Tom
I've never underestimated Tom
I've never understood Tom
I've seen Tom naked
I've spoken with Tom
I've talked to Tom
I've worked with Tom
Is it really Tom?
Is Tom with Mary?
Is that really Tom?
Is Tom a Christian?
Is Tom a genius?
Is Tom a prisoner?
Is Tom a suspect?
Is Tom an alcoholic?
Is Tom at home?
Is Tom behaving himself?

Is Tom ready yet?
Is Tom really back?
Is Tom still aboard?
Is Tom still coming?
Is Tom still here?
Is Tom still playing?
Is Tom still recovering?
Is Tom still sleeping?
Is Tom still up?
Is Tom suggesting that?
Is Tom under arrest?
Isn't his name Tom?
It can't be Tom
It couldn't be Tom
It was Tom's fault
It's bigger than Tom
It's important to Tom
It's what Tom believed
It's what Tom had
It's what Tom wanted
Let's go find Tom
Let's start with Tom
Let's try Tom again
Let's try Tom first
Maybe I'll bring Tom
Maybe Tom wasn't available
Please don't tell Tom
Should I include Tom?
Should I take Tom?
Should I tell Tom?
Should we arrest Tom?
Should we get Tom?
That's what Tom needs
That's what Tom says
That's what Tom thinks
That's what Tom wants
That's what Tom remembers
That's where Tom is
That's where Tom lives
That's where Tom worked
The gun was Tom's
They don't like Tom
They're staring at Tom
They're talking to Tom
They're Tom and Mary
Tom's train hasn't arrived yet
How soon must I be back?
It's unintelligible, I know
It's incomprehensible, I know
He made it, but she didn't
Have I arrived too late?
I arrived at 2:30
I've only just arrived
It's about time Tom arrived
Tom arrived at 2:30
Tom arrived at work at 2:30
Tom, we've arrived!
We'll arrive within the hour
We've arrived safely
What time did Tom arrive?
When did Tom arrive?
When does Tom usually arrive?
When is Tom arriving?
When will Tom arrive?
I've got a terrible headache
I've made a terrible mistake
Is that so terrible?
It's a terrible problem
That's terrible advice
Tom, you look terrible
Tom, you sound terrible
We're all in terrible danger
What a terrible day!
What a terrible experience!
What a terrible nickname!
What a terrible waste!
Who was that terrible man?
You're a terrible cook
You're a terrible dancer
You're a terrible driver
You're a terrible liar
You're in terrible danger
I thou thee, thou traitor!
Oh my god!
I've killed a pregnant woman!
You understand German, right?
We're heading out at dawn
She's a control freak
He's a control freak
She wouldn't even look at me
He wouldn't even look at me
There's nothing wrong with her
There's nothing wrong with him
It's not just that
How did you meet her?
How did you meet him?
Get out of here!
Who's that cute redhead?
Who's that cute guy?
Who's that cute boy?
That's Tom's girl
Do you like pretzels?
Can rabbits swim?
You're mistaken
She's only had two boyfriends
I've only had two boyfriends.
This isn't serious
Am I a bad person?
What did she look like?
What did he look like?
He doesn't really speak French
I'm out of it
I'll go get the pizza
Finally, the bell rang
He's addicted to junk food
I don't feel like snuggling
Are rabbits able to swim?
Is it time for us to go home?
My dear, don't be shy!
Shoichi's face turned pale
It's all new for me
Don't put the kibosh on me
After all, he's your boss
Can you see me after supper?
Did you all go?
Do you like adventure stories?
Do you sell alarm clocks?
Don't act like a child
Don't be alarmed
He's not hurt badly
I'll wait
He's not afraid of anyone
How long ago did it happen?
How many are there in all?
How much is the admission?
I can't adopt your view
I couldn't do this all alone
I couldn't invite him
We're not well acquainted
I'm afraid it's too late
I'm ahead in my work
I'm leaving in the afternoon
If that's so, all the better
Is everyone against him?
Is it all over?
Is your aim good?
The two statements don't agree
We're fighting against time
What do you aim to be?
What is your aim in life?
What was that alarm for?
What's the actual cost?
When will this be acted upon?
Where did he see action?
Who is acting as head?
Will you go after the mail?
You are right, after all
After all, it's reasonable
And then what happened?
Are you as tall as me?
Are you enjoying good health?
Are you going for a walk?
Are you speaking frankly?
Are you uncomfortable?
At last, I managed to find him
At last, we got rid of him
At most, it'll cost ten pesos
At this point, he arrived
He's a Don Juan
It's very inflammable
There's a hole in the floor
Be frank with me!
Can you tie a bow?
Carry out my orders!
Come on, don't be a coward!
Come on, shake hands, boys!
Control yourself!
Don't get excited
I'm a zombie!
He's a fan of Klingon opera
She's a fan of Italian opera
They weren't listening
I'm not a fan of postmodernism
I'm a fan of German opera
Do you like French opera?
I don't understand opera
I don't get opera
He's an opera lover
She's an opera fan
Don't look like that
The boy doesn't see the letter
I've lost track of who I am
Oh stop, that tickles!
Stop tickling me!
I'm really sorry to hear that
Fuck that!
You're just like your father
You're just like your mother
My punctuation isn't perfect
He said: "C'est la vie"!
Welcome, prisoners..
I mean, guests
You're a bachelor too?
Are you a bachelor, too?
Did they repair the watch?
Did you change your clothes?
Didn't you win the bet?
Do you have Saturday off?
Do you have the tickets?
Do you know Mr. Jackson?
Do you like pineapple drinks?
Do you like pork loin?
Do you understand French?
Do you want half of this cake?
Does this suitcase bother you?
Don't be a baby
Don't be careless in your work
Don't be crazy!
Don't be so nosy
Don't believe him
Don't believe that
It's all a fairy tale
Don't bother me any more!
Don't complicate the matter
Don't disobey my orders
Don't disturb me!
Don't do a half-baked job
Don't fool yourself
He doesn't love you
Don't get mixed up in that
Don't go away
You're not bothering us
Don't go so fast!
Don't make me wait long
Don't mess things up
Don't pay any attention to him
Don't play dumb
Don't put off those matters
Don't ride that horse
He'll throw you
Don't shake the table
Don't speak to me about Tom
We're on bad terms
Don't talk to the driver
Don't trust him
He's very two-faced
Don't worry
I'll take care of that
Don't you like any of these?
Down with the king!
Excuse me, but you're mistaken
Food shouldn't be wasted
I don't understand
Good evening!
Great!
We'll go together
Has the mail been sorted?
He can't control his desires
He can't keep time
He couldn't control the horse
He couldn't start the motor
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't notice the change
He didn't say a single word
He didn't shed a tear
He didn't tell the truth
Do a little gymnastics!
You'll never get my boobs
How are your folks?
How do you manage to do this?
How much do you earn per week?
I believe I'm in the right
I can't go with you
I can't lift this
It's too heavy
I can't play it from memory
I can't see in this light
I can't untie this knot
I didn't like that man's looks
I don't feel like doing it
I don't feel like working
I don't know exactly
I don't like thick soup
I don't like to wash dishes
I don't want to get into a jam
It's getting dark
I prefer a ready-made suit
I think it's clearing up
I think they're honest people
I'd like a medium size
I'd like two cans of tomatoes
I'll do it later
I'll do it when my turn comes
I'll eat something light
I'll ship my baggage first
I'll take charge of the work
I'll tell you afterwards
I'll tell you how to do it
I'll wear a white dress
I'm at your service
I'm counting on your help
I'm fed up with your stories!
I'm going because I want to
I'm in dire need of money
I'm indebted to you
I'm intrigued by what you say
I'm unnecessary here
I'm very cold
I've just learned the news
If we walk, we'll be very late
If you want to, we'll go
In a way, you are right
In any case, we'll go
Is it very far from here?
Is that the way to answer?
Is this tea set complete?
Is tomorrow a holiday?
Is your name on the list?
It can't be removed
It's fixed
It isn't suitable for minors
It'll be known sooner or later
It'll have to be done forcibly
It'll have to be done tomorrow
It'll surely rain today
It's a democratic government
It's a large amount
It's a leather valise
It's a military club
It's a scalp disease
It's a thankless job
It's clear that it's so
It's gone out of style
It's hard to achieve happiness
It's imperative to go out
It's not at all easy
It's raining very hard
It's ten minutes to two
It's the best house in town
It's the best we have
It's the same hat
It's to the point
It's useless
Don't harp on it any longer
Jamaica's an English colony
Let's pool all our money
Let's talk seriously
Man, don't say that!
Maybe it won't rain tomorrow
Meat's scarce
Monday's a holiday
Will you give me a light?
My health's very bad
Now it's the real thing
Once and for all, I forbid it
Plug up that leak!
It's going out
Read what's on the label
You're blocking the way
Don't chew it
It's sturdy
That artist's very popular
That child's easily distracted
That doesn't matter to me
That food's hard to digest
That isn't convenient for me
That isn't to my liking
That knot's loose
That man's not to be trusted
That plan's bound to fail
That word isn't in common use
That's a very old saying
That's a very witty phrase
That's childish
That's idle talk
That's my basis for saying so
That's the least of it
That's very easy to do
That's very inconsiderate
The bill's correct, thank you
The bread's baking in the oven
The climate's very mild
The cloth's very faded
The company's failed
The cover doesn't fit well
The elevator isn't running
The hat's hanging on the rack
The hose didn't work
The hotel's full of foreigners
The murder weapon wasn't found
The patient's in the hospital
The pie's delicious
The price of food's gone up
The project's taking shape
The road hasn't been leveled
The road's in bad condition
The shoe doesn't fit me
It's too small
The sky's clear today
The soup's cold
The soup's very hot
The suit's custom-made
The traffic's congested
The wheel doesn't turn
There's a grease spot
There's no reason to get angry
There's no way to translate it
These ties aren't mine
These windows aren't clean
Why don't you hug me?
I'm not a liar
This child's very naughty
This furniture's in the way
This is a one-way street
It won't make many stops
This letter's for me
This song's in the key of G
This wine's very intoxicating
This work is half-done
This work's driving me crazy
Those aren't mine
Wait a while, it's pouring
Wake me up at eight o'clock
We don't question what you say
I hope that my accent's good
Didn't I say that?
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't that sound good?
Didn't you bring anything?
Didn't you feel like going?
Didn't you get one?
Didn't you hear me?
Didn't you hear that?
Didn't you hear Tom?
Didn't you miss me?
Didn't you order red wine?
Didn't you proofread it?
Didn't you see anything?
Didn't you see it?
Didn't you take one?
Doctors don't know anything
Doesn't it bother you?
Doesn't it feel good?
Doesn't it taste good?
Doesn't Mary look cute?
Doesn't Mary look pretty?
Doesn't that bother you?
Doesn't that change things?
Doesn't that feel better?
Doesn't that make sense?
Doesn't that mean anything?
Doesn't that prove anything?
Doesn't that prove something?
Doesn't that smell good?
Doesn't that smell great?
Doesn't that sound good?
Doesn't that sound nice?
Doesn't that sound serious?
Doesn't Tom like girls?
Doesn't Tom look good?
Doesn't Tom look handsome?
Doesn't Tom look scared?
Don't answer any questions
Don't answer that phone
Don't argue with me
Don't ask me again
Don't ask me that
Don't be a chicken
Don't be a coward
Don't be a hero
Don't be a hypocrite
Don't be a jerk
Don't be a lunatic
Hey, don't worry
I almost didn't recognize you
I didn't do too badly
I didn't find a thing
I didn't get much sleep
I didn't hear you knock
I didn't mean to interrupt
I didn't mean to pry
I didn't see a thing
I didn't see you there
I didn't think it mattered
I didn't think of that
I didn't think Tom knew
I didn't want to waste my time
I didn't even consider that
It didn't do any good
It didn't go very well
It didn't seem to matter
It doesn't look quite right
It doesn't look too bad
It doesn't make any sense
It doesn't matter now
It doesn't matter right now
It doesn't mean a thing
It doesn't mean anything
It doesn't ring a bell
It doesn't ring any bells
It doesn't seem fair
It doesn't sound too serious
It doesn't sound very exciting
Just don't worry
Now, don't panic
Now, don't worry
Oh, don't apologize
Oh, don't bother
Oh, don't worry
That doesn't make any sense
That won't last forever
Tom didn't even say goodbye
Tom didn't even tell me
Tom didn't finish the race
Tom didn't go into details
Tom didn't have a chance
Tom didn't have any problems
Tom didn't have much choice
Tom didn't return my calls
Tom doesn't make mistakes
Tom isn't answering his cell
Tom, don't interrupt
Tom, don't leave
Don't go
That's all we needed!
She doesn't listen
He doesn't listen
He's pathetic and stupid
What can you say in English?
I'm an agnostic
We don't have any other choice
We don't have another choice
I guess it's only a joke
I'm going to shoot him dead
We'll go a week from today
We'll meet at the usual place
We'll meet in the theater
We'll meet on Thursday morning
We'll meet right here
We'll use other material
We're halfway through
We're starting to work today
What a cute girl!
What a dignified man!
What a pretty girl!
What a pretty woman!
What an amusing situation!
What are your duties?
What are your initials?
What are your intentions?
What kind of work do you like?
What page are you on?
What shall we do afterwards?
What time did the meeting end?

How's your morning been?
Are you getting enough oxygen?

Where's your captain?
Where shall we begin?
Where do we even begin?

So what's going on?
Need I go on?
Am I under suspicion?
Can I make one observation?
How do I eat without a spoon?

How did you think it would go?
So how did the date go?
How fast does this thing go?
How did Tom's hearing go?
How far would Tom go?
You've stalled the engine
There's no mention of it here
That's not an issue anymore
That's not an issue
I'm so bored I could scream
If not for me, do it for Tom
Those are old wives' tales
I'm familiar with such things
You can't get rid of it
Today is tomorrow's yesterday
It's just a stone's throw away
Don't take it so literally
Do you mean to go?
How fast does this car go?
How far can you go?
Where did the money go?
Can I ask who?
Do you feel it, too?
What am I agreeing to?
Hey, what are you two up to?
Who are you sitting next to?
Is the water deep?
Who said you could sleep?
How can I make Tom stop?

When are you picking it up?
Would you just shut up?

Why bother?
What could be easier?
Are you the medical examiner?
Did you fix the scanner?
Are you having dinner?
Can I return this shirt later?
Can't this boat go any faster?
Can you make it go any faster?
Who's to say which is better?
Where's your babysitter?
My, aren't you clever?
Would that be fair?
How is this fair?
Is that your own hair?
What's with your hair?
May I offer you my chair?
What were they imprisoned for?
What's this vaccine for?
Who are you here for?
How much are they asking for?
Is that too much to ask for?

How do you wear these things?
Now, why do you think that is?
Do you see this?
How did you get like this?
Why did you not tell me this?
Why tell me this?
Do you approve of this?
Are you behind all of this?
What's the point of this?
Do I get paid for doing this?
How do you deal with all this?
How come you know all this?
Don't I have some say in this?
Should I bring Tom in on this?
When does Tom want to do this?
How does Tom fit into this?
How do you stop this?
Did you pack any snacks?

Don't you see what this means?
Don't you see what that means?
Can we go over my options?
Do you carry weapons?
Where are those prisoners?
Does Tom wear shoes indoors?
Do I have to undress?
Has Tom made any progress?
Do you take American Express?
Don't I get a goodbye kiss?
Who else do you miss?
How come you're not the boss?
Why did it have to be us?
Where are they sending us?
Do you want to hang with us?
Tom, are you eating with us?
What does that tell us?
Would you care to join us?
How does it help us?
Did you volunteer us?
Why is Tom looking at us?
What's all the ruckus?
Were you conscientious?
Don't you have any good news?
How did Tom take the news?
What are you smiling at?
Can you crank up the heat?
Isn't life just great?
How did they manage that?
How can we prove that?
Do you realize that?
How can you be sure of that?
How did Tom make use of that?
How do you live with that?
Do you really think that?
Did anyone else feel that?
Does anybody else feel that?
Did you hear all that?
What's the fun in that?
Why on earth would I do that?
How about I do that?
How did we do that?
How many people can do that?
How do you respond to that?
What would you say to that?
What do you say to that?
Does anyone else hear that?
How weird is that?
How awesome is that?
What kind of talk is that?
Can't you just accept that?
Who do we see about that?
Are you real sure about that?
How do we know that?
How could Tom know that?
How does Tom know that?
How could you say that?
Aw, how can you say that?
Am I getting sloppy or what?
Do you want to make a bet?
Would you care to bet?
How bad can this get?
How much will you get?
Isn't that where we first met?
Does Tom have a secret?
But why is it all so secret?
Tom, are you all set?
Aren't you dressed yet?
Have we heard from Tom yet?
Was I not supposed to eat yet?
Have you got it yet?
How much is there left?
How much milk is there left?
How do I look tonight?
Can you watch Tom tonight?
You were a kid once, right?
You're messing with me, right?
You bought Tom a gift, right?
You've got your permit, right?
It's over now, right?
Does that feel right?
Do I have it right?
Can you hold that thought?
Have you confirmed it?
How'd you find it?
How did we not see it?
So how did Tom take it?
Did you take it?
How did Tom like it?
How could they have done it?
What good would come of it?
Are you sure of it?
What do I get out of it?
How's Tom taking it?
How are you taking it?
How do you deal with it?
Can we get on with it?
What's Tom have to do with it?
Why must we do it?
How do you kids do it?
How do parents do it?
What did you do to it?
Do you feel up to it?
Did you put Tom up to it?
Can we just drop it?
Would you drop it?
Should we run for it?
Are you sure you're up for it?
Life isn't fair, is it?
How accurate is it?
How special is it?
Where on earth did you get it?
Who could forget it?
Does that mean you bought it?
Did I blow it?
How could you allow it?
What's with the outfit?
How is that significant?
Wouldn't that be redundant?
When do I get what I want?
Just what is it you want?
Is it money you want?
Might I have a moment?
Could you give us a moment?
Do you like the apartment?
Is this the art department?
How come we're different?
Are you content?
Is there a point?
What have we got?
Do you want in or not?
Did you see the transcript?
How soon can you start?
How much are we short?
Can I help with breakfast?
Can I be honest?
May I be honest?
Isn't that a little dishonest?
Who made the actual arrest?
Are you the pathologist?
Are you a seismologist?
Are you a paleontologist?
What am I up against?
What can you make out?
Are you freaking out?
How'd it work out?
Would you chill out?
Which way is out?
When did this come about?
Who else are we talking about?
So what were we talking about?
So what are you talking about?
Did Tom say what it was about?
Who do we see next?
Why does Tom need you?
Have they spotted you?
Did the phone wake you?
How does that strike you?
You're not one of us, are you?
So how mad are you?
Just who are you?
Does Tom scare you?
How can I refuse you?
How could Tom hate you?
Why do I believe you?
Is that bothering you?
How much am I paying you?
How do I thank you?
Am I supposed to thank you?
Did I ask you?
What do I call you?
What can I tell you?
Well, what does that tell you?
Get some help, will you?
Why should we harm you?
You never stop, do you?
Do I look dead to you?
Does this seem strange to you?
Does that seem strange to you?
How could I lie to you?
Why did Tom come to you?
How do they seem to you?
What do I mean to you?
Do I look happy to you?
Do I look busy to you?
What's got into you?
When is good for you?
Was that weird for you?
How's that going for you?
Isn't that enough for you?
Does Tom always speak for you?
Does that work for you?
What was in it for you?
What drives you?
Did Tom try to assault you?
Will this satisfy you?
Does that satisfy you?
So what else is new?
Are you a member of this crew?
Did you see the show?
How many do you see now?
Why come to me now?
Could you get it for me now?
How many of you are there now?
Is it safe for us to look now?
Why wait until now?
Am I under investigation now?
Do they know that we know?
Does Tom really want to know?
It's incredible, you know?
How could you know?
Does Tom shower every day?
How are we feeling today?
Why should anyone pay?
Do you want to pray?
What's there to say?
Does that mean you'll stay?
What if I asked you to stay?
What gave me away?
How do I make you go away?
What gave it away?
What is it with you, anyway?
What do you see in Tom anyway?
Is there a hat shop nearby?
Is the house ready?
What's with everybody?
Can I ask why?
Can I tell Tom why?
What if I'm not lucky?
Do we need them that badly?
Isn't it lovely?
Do you have other family?
Does Tom have any family?
Are you here voluntarily?
What is your type exactly?
What's the skinny?
Why are you talking so funny?
Have you considered therapy?
Do you want me to be happy?
Did it make you angry?
What's the whole story?
Why not let Tom try?
Would you care to try?
Am I cleared for duty?
What a disgusting idea!
What an excellent idea!
What a big cake!
What a charming couple!
What a lovely morning!
What a blessing!
What rotten luck!
What a beautiful room!
What an odd expression!
What a letdown!
What an awful mess!
What a bunch of idiots!
What a wonderful sight!
What a cute little boy!
The performance began at 8:00
See you guys at 2:30
I'll get there at about 2:30
I should be there by 2:30
Tell Tom I'll be there by 2:30
They're going to be OK
That would've been OK
Tom wants us to think he's OK
I'd like a piña colada
OK, I get the idea
That's an interesting idea
That's a very interesting idea
Well, I like that idea
I haven't the slightest idea
Let's have tea
I've got claustrophobia
This might be Tom's umbrella
I'll take my umbrella
I didn't like my first job
We'll see you at the pub
We're stuck in traffic
Tom didn't do anything bad
Tom wasn't so bad
It wasn't so bad
It wasn't all that bad
They're probably already dead
I'm going mad
There's not much more to add
I'm ready for bed
I didn't want to be disturbed
I'm unconvinced
We're short-handed
I hope you're not offended
We could've managed
They've all been paged
It can't be changed
It's not quite finished
Tom wasn't punished
Tom wasn't satisfied
Tom and Mary weren't married
I'm already married
I can tell that you're worried
Tom wasn't worried
I've done what you've asked
Tom can't be so easily fooled
It's all settled
I can't get this lock opened
I can't get this door opened
That's not all that happened
It's poisoned
Tom wasn't a bit scared
Tom isn't a bit scared
Tom might've been murdered
It's being repaired
I thought you'd be tired
They said they're tired
Tom didn't feel tired
I'm beginning to get tired
I'm feeling a bit tired
Tom wasn't a bit tired
Tom doesn't seem very tired
I've retired
I'm not dressed
The kids weren't impressed
I'm getting confused
I'm getting a bit confused
Everyone's a bit confused
It's a little complicated
Well, it's complicated
Everyone's life is complicated
I think you've been cheated
I think you've been infected
It's just what I expected
This isn't quite what I wanted
This isn't what I wanted
That's exactly what I wanted
I must've fainted
Tom might've been disappointed
I don't like to be interrupted
Your time won't be wasted
I told you I wasn't interested
They said they're exhausted
Tom wasn't deceived
I wouldn't get involved
We'll be well paid
They'll be well paid
I'm not at all afraid
Don't forget what I said
I think you're stupid
They're stupid
It isn't a bit cold
Tom didn't stand
Tom didn't quite understand
I think Tom didn't understand
Tom was Mary's friend
Let's go hiking next weekend
I didn't mind
You're not in your right mind
I've just changed my mind
I don't like standing around
I think we'll need more food
I should've bought more food
They're no good
Tom wasn't good
This cake isn't that good
They say it's very good
Tom's French is very good
I think you've misunderstood
This shouldn't be hard
This shouldn't be too hard
This really isn't hard
Come back here, you coward
Everyone thinks I'm weird
That's just absurd
Look at Tom's face
Tom went into Mary's office
Tom wasn't nice
Everyone's been really nice
That's justice
I've only seen Tom twice
I thought I'd take a chance
Here's my chance
I should've paid in advance
That's quite a coincidence
Please don't lose patience
Tom won't know the difference
I've only seen Tom once
I didn't know where to hide
We'll meet you outside
I shouldn't have been so rude
I've got to be free
I couldn't see
Now you're safe
I still think we're safe
I'll put it somewhere safe
You're perfectly safe
Tom doesn't have a wife
I'll discuss it with my wife
I'll tell my wife
That's common knowledge
I didn't budge
Tom's in charge
That wasn't a lie
I thought I'd wear a tie
They're making a movie
Tom wouldn't like this movie
I knew you'd enjoy that movie
I don't deny I made a mistake
I must've made a mistake
Tom must've made a mistake
You must've made a mistake
It's an understandable mistake
That's a very common mistake
Maybe I'll buy a bike
That's what I like
My car isn't for sale
It's highly improbable
Tom's voice is unmistakable
I'm very miserable
It's quite comfortable
It would've been possible
It's always been impossible
We're in a lot of trouble
Now we're in trouble
Don't get into trouble
You're in for trouble
It doesn't cost money to smile
Tom didn't smile
It's basically quite simple
That would've been simple
Life isn't always simple
This really isn't that simple
It's amazingly simple
That's the rule
I'm glad you reminded me
Tom's behavior infuriated me
I didn't want anyone to see me
You're not like me
That doesn't trouble me
They're not afraid of me
My wife didn't come with me
You'll be here with me
Come on, tell me
You've been stealing from me
You've been luckier than me
The joke's on me
Tom doesn't count on me
That doesn't concern me
They didn't speak to me
It doesn't look like fun to me
That's the place for me
I know you're still mad at me
Everyone's looking at me
They're shooting at me
I don't want Tom to forget me
Don't forget me
Please don't leave without me
Don't start without me
OK, you two, follow me
They're playing a game
That's an unusual name
It's always been the same
This isn't a good time
I've waited a long time
We've been waiting a long time
I thought you'd be on time
It's supper time
I wasn't married at that time
I should've stayed home
They've all gone back home
They've taken Tom home
I'm tired
Let's go home
Let's get home
I don't like waiting in line
Tom doesn't drink red wine
It couldn't be done
Come back when you're done
Thank you for all you've done
Show Tom how it's done
That's the way it's done
I hope we're all alone
Tom wasn't alone
I'd rather be left alone
We can't do it alone
Tom isn't the squeamish type
That's just how things are
Tom didn't seem to care
Tom said that he doesn't care
You're not doing your share
You're not needed here
It's cold around here
I thought you'd be here
I don't think I should be here
Is it safe for us to be here?
We'll always be here
There's a mistake here
That's why I came here
I don't know why we came here
I didn't ask you to come here
There shouldn't be anyone here
Remember why you're here
I don't like living here
I don't think I belong here
Don't park here
I've done well here
The view's good from here
It isn't far from here
There's a good view from here
It's very cold in here
It's very dark in here
It's very hot in here
It's very smoky in here
It's very noisy in here
Let's work together here
We're all right here
Something isn't right here
Tell Tom I'm not here
It's beautiful out here
Grass doesn't grow here
There isn't anybody here
Tom doesn't know anybody here
It won't be lonely here
It's still there
Tom might've been there
They're still in there
Let's park over there
It's not there
There wasn't anybody there
It'll be crowded everywhere

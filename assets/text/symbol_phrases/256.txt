Can anybody do that?
His flight was canceled.
Is Tom a student?
I don't care why Tom did that
I'm just glad he did
I sold it to Tom.
Did you go to Boston?
No I didn't.
How about Chicago?
Did you go to Boston?
No, I didn't.
How about Chicago?
Yes, I did go to Chicago.
I don't know how to do that
Would you please show me how?
I'll do that tomorrow.
Could you show me how?
I've never used a winch before
Could you show me how?
I've never used a lathe before
Could you show me how?
It's cold in here
I think so.
Tom wasn't eating an apple
I'm sorry
I'd rather do that tomorrow
Would that be OK?
Where are you going?
I'm going to Boston.
What do you need?
I don't need anything.
Did you do that yesterday?
No, I didn't.
I didn't jump into the pool
Have you done that yet?
Yes, I have.
Is Tom a Canadian?
I don't know.
I'm sorry
I won't ever do that again
I don't know
What's that building?
It's a bank.
Can you speak French?
No, I can't.
Can you do that today?
I think so.
Is Tom in Boston?
Yes, he is.
Is Tom a doctor?
Yes, he is.
We're not going to let Tom win
This is probably Tom's bicycle
The roof of Tom's house is red
My guess is that Tom won't win
It's likely that Tom won't win
It's Tom that wants to see you
If it rains, Tom won't do that
If Tom can do that, so can you
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't win
I'm not the one who kissed Tom
What time is it now?
It's 2:30.
I'm not surprised that Tom won
What day is today?
It's Monday.
I'm going to Boston to see Tom
I'll get Tom to do that for us
I'll do that if Tom asks me to
I'd never let Tom drive my car
I'd do that if Tom asked me to
I'd do anything to protect Tom
I wonder why Tom isn't at home
I wonder why Tom can't do that
I wonder which jacket is Tom's
I wasn't sure why Tom was late
I told Tom that I wouldn't win
I told Tom that I couldn't win
I thought Tom wouldn't confess
I thought Tom didn't like cats
I think you're too old for Tom
I think we'd better inform Tom
I think Tom isn't going to win
I think Tom can't speak French
I taught Tom's children French
I sure hope Tom didn't do that
I promised Tom I'd cook dinner
I know why Tom doesn't do that
I know Tom isn't related to me
I know Tom isn't likely to win
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught
I knew Tom wouldn't forgive me
I knew Tom wouldn't be shocked
I hope that Tom didn't do that
I hope Tom didn't get arrested
I haven't asked Tom to do that
I had no idea Tom wouldn't win
I don't think Tom ate anything
I don't know why Tom does that
I didn't know Tom was so upset
I didn't know Tom was sleeping
I didn't know Tom was confused
I didn't expect Tom to help me
I can't do that as fast as Tom
I believed you, but Tom didn't
You can't let Tom win anymore
Why on earth did Tom eat that?
Why does Tom not want to swim?
Why do you think Tom will win?
Who told Tom he could do that?
Who does Tom usually eat with?
When did Tom actually do that?
What's Tom standing there for?
What's Tom all dressed up for?
What should Tom do about that?
What did Tom study in college?
What did Tom recommend you do?
What did Tom go to Boston for?
What did Tom expect you to do?
That's not why Tom didn't win
Let's try to do that with Tom
Let's inform Tom by telephone
It's good that Tom didn't win
It wasn't easy for Tom to win
Is this the cup that Tom used?
I'm sure that Tom can do that
I'm sure Tom will wait for us
I'm pretty sure Tom won't win
I'm pretty sure Tom can't win
I'm from Boston and so is Tom
I'm coming to Boston with Tom
I'm certain that Tom will win
I'm certain that Tom will cry
I'll visit Tom whenever I can
I'll let Tom do that tomorrow
I'd never tell Tom what to do
I'd like Tom to be on my team
I'd do that if Tom told me to
I wondered why Tom didn't win
I wasn't expecting Tom to win
I was hoping Tom wouldn't win
I was hoping I'd see Tom here
I told you Tom didn't do that
I thought that Tom didn't win
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping
I thought Tom didn't eat meat
I know Tom probably won't cry
I know Tom isn't going to win
I knew why Tom didn't like me
I knew Tom wouldn't come back
I knew Tom wouldn't be afraid
I knew Tom wouldn't back down
I knew Tom didn't know French
I just hope Tom didn't suffer
I hope Tom isn't too stubborn
I hope Tom isn't still crying
I hope Tom didn't get jealous
I hope Tom didn't get injured
I hope Tom didn't get annoyed
I hear that Tom won't do that
I hear Tom doesn't drink beer
I haven't told Tom what to do
I haven't seen Tom since 2013
I hadn't intended to hurt Tom
I didn't think you'd like Tom
I didn't know Tom would leave
I didn't know Tom would dance
I didn't know Tom was worried
I didn't know Tom was nervous
I didn't know Tom was jealous
I didn't know Tom was at home
I didn't know Tom had noticed
I bet Tom won't leave on time
How often do you eat with Tom?
How do you think Tom will win?
How do you know Tom won't win?
Everyone did that, except Tom
Don't let Tom do that anymore
Does Tom want to do that, too?
Does Tom think he can do that?
Do you think that Tom can win?
Do you think Tom will be late?
Do you think Tom was confused?
Do you think Tom is still mad?
Do you really want Tom to win?
Do you really think Tom is OK?
Do you know why Tom is absent?
Do I have to do that with Tom?
Did you open the door for Tom?
Did Tom say where he did that?
Did Tom say when he'd do that?
Did Tom say he didn't do that?
Did Tom go fishing by himself?
Could you ask Tom to be quiet?
Could Tom get home by himself?
Can you still get Tom to help?
Can you still do that for Tom?
Both Tom and I didn't do that
Are you sure Tom wants to win?
Are you still waiting for Tom?
Are you still sure that's Tom?
Are you still sure it was Tom?
Are you saying Tom didn't win?
Is Tom well?
No, he isn't.
You hope Tom wins, don't you?
You didn't help Tom, did you?
Would Tom really sing for us?
Will Tom get back home today?
Why is Tom being so stubborn?
Why is Tom always so unlucky?
Why doesn't Tom want to stay?
Why doesn't Tom ever do that?
Why does Tom want me to stay?
Why did you allow Tom to win?
Why did Tom do that that way?
Who forced Tom to eat a frog?
Who cares if Tom doesn't win?
What's Tom doing with my car?
This isn't an apple
It's a pear
What's Tom doing in the park?
What did Tom want to show us?
What did Tom want to show me?
What did Tom suggest you buy?
What did Tom just say to you?
What did Tom do after dinner?
What did Tom cook for dinner?
We're confident Tom will win
Please tell Tom I didn't win
Please ask Tom what he'll do
Perhaps Tom hasn't done that
Let's not ask Tom to do that
Let's go and watch Tom dance
It's doubtful if Tom can win
It looks like Tom isn't here
Is Tom going to swim with us?
If Tom does that, I will too
I've seen Tom do that before
I'm surprised Tom didn't win
I'm sure that Tom didn't win
I'm quite sure Tom won't win
I'm pretty sure Tom will win
I'm pretty sure Tom will cry
I'm pretty sure Tom has died
I'm not sure if Tom can swim
I'm going to do that for Tom
I'm glad that Tom didn't win
I'm glad Tom was able to win
I'm a student, but Tom isn't
I'll meet Tom at the station
I'll have Tom do that for me
I'll get Tom to wait for you
I'll call Tom Monday evening
I'll ask Tom why he did that
I'll ask Tom stay for dinner
I'll ask Tom how he did that
I'd help if Tom wanted me to
I'll do that tomorrow
I wonder why Tom isn't ready
I wonder if Tom isn't hungry
I sure hope Tom doesn't lose
I promised Tom that I'd wait
I know both of Tom's sisters
I know Tom won't wait for us
I knew that Tom wouldn't win
I knew that Tom couldn't win
I knew Tom wouldn't eat that
I knew Tom wouldn't buy that
I knew Tom wouldn't be there
I knew Tom wouldn't be awake
I just can't believe Tom won
I hope Tom didn't get scared
I hear Tom doesn't drink tea
I haven't reimbursed Tom yet
I don't know what Tom buried
I don't believe Tom will win
I don't believe Tom will cry
I didn't know Tom would come
I didn't know Tom was so old
I didn't know Tom was sleepy
I didn't know Tom was scared
I didn't know Tom was lonely
I didn't know Tom was hungry
I didn't know Tom was asleep
I didn't know Tom was afraid
I didn't know Tom was absent
I didn't know Tom needed one
I can't order Tom to do that
I can do that, but Tom can't
I bet Tom won't wait for you
I asked Tom how he'd do that
How would Tom have done that?
How long has Tom been abroad?
How did Tom actually do that?
How could Tom have done that?
Does Tom want to leave today?

There's no way Tom will win
Probably Tom didn't do that
Let's let Tom do that again
It's Tom that I want to see
It looks like Tom won't win
Is Tom likely to leave soon?
Is Tom going to leave today?
If Tom comes, give him this
I'm writing a letter to Tom
I'm sure that Tom is honest
I'm sure that Tom can't win
I'm pretty sure Tom can win
I'm positive Tom didn't win
I'm not the one who hit Tom
I'm here in Boston with Tom
I'm happy we waited for Tom
I'm glad Tom wasn't injured
I'll talk to Tom about that
I'll do that if Tom pays me
I'd love to see Tom do that

I'd expected Tom not to win
I wonder why Tom didn't win
I told you Tom couldn't win

I know one of Tom's sisters
I knew Tom wouldn't hurt me
I knew Tom wouldn't confess
I knew Tom wouldn't be late

I hear Tom doesn't eat meat
I haven't called Tom lately
I expect that Tom won't win

That probably is Tom's car
Tell Tom you can't do that
Tell Tom that I'll do that
Perhaps Tom didn't do that
Is Tom still likely to win?
I'm teaching French to Tom
I'm sure that Tom will win
I'm sure that Tom will cry

We know Tom can't do that
We didn't do that for Tom
This used to be Tom's car
That's why Tom left early
That's probably Tom's car
Tell Tom we can't do that
Most likely Tom won't win
Most likely Tom won't cry
You'd better leave early today
You'd better do that right now
You never should've left early
Is Tom likely to buy that?
I'm waiting for Tom to go
I'm sure that Tom can win
I'm positive Tom will win
I'm positive Tom will cry
I'm positive Tom can swim
I'm convinced Tom can win
I'd do that if Tom let me
You look like you've been hurt
You look like you're terrified
You look like you're satisfied
You look like you're miserable
You look like you're irritated
You look like you're impressed
You look like you're exhausted
You look like you're disgusted
You look like you're depressed
You look like you're contented
You have until 2:30 to do that
You don't have to do that here
You aren't required to do that
You aren't expected to do that
I told you Tom didn't win
I told Tom I wouldn't win
I told Tom I couldn't win
Tom's dog isn't as big as mine
Tom won't likely be eating now
Tom won't be able to win today
Tom won't be able to win again
Tom will do that tomorrow, too
We've decided to sing together
Tom wasn't with me on that day
We're finally going to do that
Tom wasn't with his girlfriend
We're both unlikely to do that
Tom wasn't wearing his uniform
We won't be doing that anymore
Tom wasn't wearing a red shirt
Tom wasn't wearing a gray suit
I know why Tom didn't win
Tom wasn't very busy yesterday
We shouldn't leave early again
Tom wasn't told not to do that
We shouldn't be doing that now
Tom wasn't the only eyewitness
I know that Tom can't win
We should've done that already
Tom wasn't the last to go home
I know Tom didn't like me
Tom wasn't talking very loudly
Tom wasn't surprised to see us
Tom wasn't surprised to see me
I knew Tom wouldn't dance
Tom wasn't supposed to help me
Tom wasn't finished doing that
We don't want to do that again
Tom wasn't expected to do that
We don't plan to sing together
Tom wasn't as busy as you were
We can't do that just anywhere
I haven't seen Tom either
I don't think Tom can win
There's enough time to eat now
I don't know what Tom got
I don't expect Tom to win
The question is who'll do that
Tom told me you didn't do that
I didn't know Tom was shy
Tom told me that he'd be alone
I didn't know Tom was mad
That's the same way we do that
How long will Tom be here?
That's something I wouldn't do
How did Tom manage to win?
That's an expensive restaurant
Has Tom ever seen you win?
Tell me why you didn't do that

Do you think Tom is alone?
Maybe you didn't do that right
Tom told me he'd be ready soon
Did you see Tom in Boston?
Maybe we shouldn't leave early
Tom told me he wasn't ticklish
Did you read Tom's letter?
Let's make the new guy do that
Tom told me he wasn't prepared
Did you expect Tom to win?
Let's keep our classroom clean
Tom told me he wasn't offended
Did Tom say he left early?
Let's go ahead and do that now
Did Tom say he didn't win?
Are you sure Tom will win?
It's fun to go out in the rain
Why would Tom ever leave?
It looks like you're terrified
Why is Tom still smiling?
It looks like you're skeptical
Why doesn't Tom eat pork?
It looks like you're organized
Why does Tom never smile?
It looks like you're miserable
Why didn't Tom win today?
It looks like you're impressed
Why didn't Tom eat lunch?
It looks like you're exhausted
Who said Tom could leave?
It looks like you're disgusted
Where did Tom go fishing?
It looks like you're depressed
What's Tom up to tonight?
What's Tom doing up here?
What's Tom doing in here?
What did Tom think of it?
I've won a free trip to Boston
What did Tom have to eat?
I've never used a winch before
I've never used a lathe before
I've just returned from Boston
I've gotten used to doing that
I've been here since yesterday
I've been doing that for years
Tom told me he didn't eat pork
I've always done this this way
Tom told me he didn't eat meat
Is what Tom told me true?
I've always done that that way
I'm positive Tom can win
I'm too tired to do that today
I'm glad that Tom waited
I'm sorry I waited for so long
I'll visit Tom in Boston
I'm not sure who paid the bill
I'll ask Tom to wait for us
I'm not interested in baseball
I'm not going to be doing that
Tom still can't sing very well
I'm no longer living in Boston
I'm likely to sleep until noon
I'm in my room studying French
Tom shouldn't have bought that
I'm going to college in Boston
I'm glad I was able to do that
I told Tom that I'd wait
I'm a native speaker of French
I'll only stay for a few hours
I'll do that tomorrow for sure
I'll definitely try to do that
I'll be in Boston next weekend
I'd stop smoking if I were you
I'd rather not wait any longer
I'd rather not go home tonight
I'd never have let that happen
I'd never allow you to do that
I'd never allow that to happen
I'd like to visit you tomorrow
I knew Tom wouldn't wait
I'd help you if you want me to
I knew Tom wouldn't sing
I'd have preferred you do that
I knew Tom wouldn't lose
I'd do that if you asked me to
I'd do that if I had more time
I hoped Tom wouldn't win
I'd do that for you if I could
I'd do it myself if I were you
Tom says he'll leave on Monday
I hope Tom doesn't snore
I hope Tom didn't notice
I wonder who'll do that for us
Tom said that he'd like to win
Tom said he's eating lunch now
I wish you'd wait a bit longer
Tom said he'd get home by 2:30
I wasn't wearing a life jacket
Tom said he won't sing tonight
I didn't want Tom to win
I wasn't the first person here
I didn't know Tom saw us
I wasn't surprised by the news
Tom said he probably won't win
I didn't ask Tom to wait
I wasn't sure how I could help
I wasn't scared to do anything
How often does Tom snore?
I wasn't expecting to get paid
How did Tom get so dirty?
I wasn't expecting any of this
How did Tom actually win?
I wasn't dressed appropriately
How can Tom possibly win?
I wasn't at church last Sunday
Tom probably won't win anymore
Don't let Tom drink beer
I wasn't able to pass the test
Don't be deceived by Tom
I wasn't able to pass the exam
Does Tom want to go, too?
I wasn't able to open the safe
Does Tom want to eat now?
I wasn't able to defend myself
Does Tom play the guitar?
Do you think Tom is cold?
Do you think Tom can win?
I was hoping I'd make the team
Tom might've agreed to do that
Do you still let Tom win?
I was hoping I'd find you here
Do you expect Tom to win?
Did you shake Tom's hand?
Did Tom say who did that?
Did Tom say how he did that?
I want to get home before 2:30
Tom looks like he's suspicious
Are you sure Tom can win?
Tom looks like he's interested
How's Tom?
He's fine.
Tom looks like he's frustrated
You can't let Tom leave
Tom looks like he's frightened
Will Tom leave tomorrow?
Tom looks like he's displeased
Why shouldn't Tom leave?
Why does Tom never swim?
Why does Tom always win?
I think that you can't do that
Why did you let Tom win?
Why can't Tom leave now?
I think I'll wait a bit longer
Who told you Tom snored?
I think I'd better leave early
Where did Tom go skiing?
When's Tom going to eat?
What's Tom watching now?
What's Tom referring to?
What's Tom planning now?
What's Tom going to eat?
I shouldn't be doing this here
What did you do for Tom?
I should've helped you do that
What did Tom have to do?
What did Tom do exactly?
What did Tom accomplish?
I regret that I didn't do that
We hope Tom doesn't win
I really can't wait any longer
I need to get home before 2:30
That's why Tom did that
Tom isn't well-known in Boston
That's how Tom did that
Tom isn't wearing his new coat
That's Tom's dictionary
Tom isn't wearing his lab coat
Tom isn't very easy to talk to
Let's hope Tom can swim
I know you'll enjoy doing that
Tom isn't the only one sitting
Tom isn't strong enough to win
Tom isn't going to let you win
I know I'll be able to do that
Tom isn't carrying a briefcase
I'm teaching Tom French
I know I shouldn't leave early
Tom isn't a member of our crew
I'm sure Tom won't wait
I knew you'd have enough money
Tom isn't a journalism student
I'm meeting Tom at 2:30
I knew you wouldn't get caught
Tom is wearing a white T-shirt
I'm glad Tom left early
I'm glad Tom didn't win
I knew you wouldn't be elected
I'll get Tom to do that
I knew we should've left early
I'd love to see Tom win
I hope you're going to do that
Tom is the only one who's busy
I'd expected Tom to win
I hope you don't do that again
I hope it's not cloudy all day
I hope it doesn't rain all day
I told Tom that I'd win
I haven't sent the package yet
I haven't ruled out doing that
I haven't grilled the fish yet
I haven't done that since 2013
Tom is in the kitchen, cooking
I haven't done anything so far

You're pretty good
You're a funny man
You're a funny guy
You're a funny girl
You're a funny gal
Sorry, I forgot
I don't need a lecture
Is he still alive?
We'll talk about it later
I'll be a good girl
To whom it may concern:
Did you just realize that?
You may not pass, sir
I'm such a fool
That's enough crying
Are you hurt?
Down with it!
It's really shameful
Don't do it!
There's nowhere to hide
I'm getting a bad feeling
Tell me about it.
Is there a woman in your life?
Is there a man in your life?
I'm afraid of heights
You're incredible
He's got the bends
Happy birthday, Shishir!
Who is this guy?
I don't want a bloody voucher
Just give me cash!
Is your dog mean?
You're trying to brainwash us!
Don't die on me
I don't fear death
We'll never make it
I can't see him either
I'll pay you a visit sometime
I'll love you always
He won't leave us alone
That's pretty impressive
She's drop-dead gorgeous
I'd hate to be in your shoes
Been a while, hasn't it?
It's been a while, hasn't it?
Why do you want to die?
You're sure there's no way?
It's absolutely impossible
I'm right beside you
I'm worried about him
I'll keep my mouth shut
That won't be a problem
I've taken care of it
We're on schedule
We're behind on schedule
What's gotten into you?
Ironic, isn't it?
I can't tell you yet
Where was he headed?
I'm being watched
You're surrounded
Where was he headed?
He was headed north.
I shouldn't be laughing
I'm scared
We'll begin shortly
Need a lift?
I'm such an idiot
Don't fall off!
It's all part of the plan
For God's sake Bob, lighten up
That's a heartwarming scene
It's no use
I didn't know you had a sister
She's better at it than I am
He's better at it than I am
It shouldn't be like that
She'll be just fine
He'll be just fine
Are you deaf?
You're coming with me
What's your secret?
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with him?
What is wrong with her?
What is wrong with that guy?
You don't have to do this
You're a strange bird
I didn't hear him coming
I didn't hear her coming
Will he live?
It's only a game
It's not just a game
Are you sure about this?
I've got bad news
That's one crazy ass bitch!
I'll never forgive myself
It's still too early to tell
It's already too late
Don't wake her up
Eat your heart out, Tom
Hold it right there, Tom!
Out of my way!
We don't need it anymore
Gangway!
That's not what I meant
Don't be an idiot
He's dead
It's official
I thought I'd never go back
Everything all right?
It's backwards compatible
Something's coming
It didn't make the cut
It's on the house
You did it!
You can't erase the past
Who is the guy in the picture?
I don't know who he is.

I don't see a man
It's 4:30 in the afternoon
Give me a half-kilo of meat
We have a half-dozen eggs
Where can I speak with you?
Where's your God now?
Where is your God now?
Even the sky cries for us!
Tomorrow I'll arrive on time
I've got your back
I've got nothing to lose
I've always loved you
Oral language isn't planned
Do you want to argue again?
Can we catch up soon, please?
He's your son
I'm no longer afraid
Don't take it personal
He's my new friend
We're having fun
When is he coming back?
I'm not crying
I'm not here to fight
Which is correct?
The speaker is middle-aged
They think it's superfluous
Do you live in Turkey?
I'm not sure about it
Stop studying!
Aha!", they said
But how much did you win?
Be off!
Scram!
We're in a library
Come on, let's go.
Where are you taking me?
He thought that I'm very tired
Let's do it!
I'll show you how it's done

They aren't putting on shoes
They're running without shoes
Give up!
Fall is finally coming!
I already put it in my bag!
I'm crazy to postpone
I don't feel like trying
Let's get ready to cloning
Isn't that just a brush fire?
How deep is it?
The marsh is knee-deep
You know English?
Are you dead?
Is it your bike?
Someone's watching me
Can you get up?
You're damn right
Let's hit the sack

Let's be friends
It's not worth it
There were 30 members in all
Do you see people in the park?
And are there boats?
Because I like stinking!
Do you drink wine?
Why do you study French?
I can't understand you
You're crazy or what?
I can't hear you
What is she late for?
Rob, go watch TV
Please, don't yell!
Do you see the color?
It means you're pregnant!
It's a little late for prayer
God, don't mock my faith!
When's the wedding?
Didn't you take precautions?
It's demeaning
I've never considered it
Don't cry
I've a patient
I have to go, Sweetheart
Remember, you're pregnant
They're going to have a baby
Will I still be able to do it?
Do you have children already?
It's my son
Do you like Joseph for a name?
If I were rich, I'd go abroad

I'm important
I'm fat
He's watching the bug
She's fixing the machine
I'm fixing something

Is it a deer?
Maybe they're happy
I'm in the house
I'm using tools
I'm using that cup
I'm going to my house
They're going to the war
She's going up the rock
He's coming to my country
I don't like that
I don't like buildings
I don't like the ocean
I'm moving the rock
I've lost my keys
The mail can't be delivered
Which name do you prefer?
They're both nice.
You're going to be a mommy
You don't have to do it here
I am John, Frank
I tell you “I run”
Go to the store!
Can I go play in my room?
Be seen by me!
I love Jane, and I like that
Is John your name?
So I can go, right?
So I can go?
Run.
Your wife saw me and told you?
There's nothing wrong with me
Who changed the subject?
The house is burning!
You can't count on him
What about the office?
Would you like to be seated?
Why are you afraid?
I'm happy about talking to you
I'm not trying to destroy

She's a tough one
I'll pay to see that
Does it work?
It's all yours
There's somebody there
It wasn't our fault..
There's somebody here
Does it look bad?
What's the remaining time?
You're our only hope
Who allowed him in?
We'll have to come back
Who did you learn it from?
From whom did you learn that?
What are you not telling me?
I've told you everything
Why at Clermont-Ferrand?
There's something going on
Should I clean my room?
Bob's come here, hasn't he?
I'm scared of wild animals
Don't let your guard down
Calm down!
Open your books to page 48.
I didn't bring mine.
Are you crazy, or what?
I'm doing well today
Are you all lost?

Is she Japanese?
Where are we going?
Something's not right
Amsterdam is amazing!
Where the hell is Tom?
I'm fed up
How about you back at work?
How did you enter in my room?
Does it ring a bell with you?
Can't we leave it as it is?
For me it's your fault!
I can't exclude it
There's also Paolo
I don't want to get married
It wasn't a coincidence
I can't excuse what I did
You expect me to believe that?
We'll have to deal with it
How do we know each other?
I can't go back with them
It's a harp
Let's return to Japan together
It's Baba's voice
It's the voice of an old woman
He's not a doctor, but a nurse
It's become dark
Would you turn on the light?
Is there a glass?
Yes, there's one on the table.
I'm after him
What are you fighting for?
I'm wondering if I love him
I'm wondering if I love her
It was all an illusion?
Was it all an illusion?
This is suicide!
See you in hell!
I can't shut it down
I won't stop you
You're all nothing but pawns
He's a drama queen
Cut the crap!
Cut the bullshit!
Is that your own idea?
You should come visit us!

Or did you change it?
I miss you too!
That would be great!
It's good to have you back!
How many do I have to do?
You're a serial killer
When does it start?
It's a catchy song
Did you get Subway?
Can I ask you something?
Long story short, I was fired

It's my biggest dream
Tell me why you are so sad.
It's personal.
What's your wife's name?
I'm not married.
I learned that from you!

He tried, and he did it
They'll do an X-ray of it
Answer me, please
When had you finished it?
Who brings me fruit and tea?
When is your next show?

I've lost my dignity
Show yourself!

Don't ask me for forgiveness
What's been done has been done
There's a bit of a wind today
It's gotten dark
Go to your room now!
They'll tell me in my room
I'm still mad at her
How do you know that it's his?
Where, Sir, are you going to?
Alas!
You do not know me, Sir
He was knee-deep in snow
Regarding humankind..
Bring pizza and beer!
I don't want to cook
I don't have time to cook
I've never been to Argentina
Where is the ice cream man?
Have you got the money?

Carry me, please!
Daddy, I can't walk any more
Daddy, I can't walk any more
So, do you get it?

Pass me the ketchup, please
Don't touch the pot!

I'm not serious
I say Paul's book will be read
I'm under a lot of pressure
I don't know why he's crying
What kind of book do you want?
You've been a great help
Would you be willing to help?
Who did you go with?
Where did you go?
What's this all about?
What makes you happy?
What are you saying?
What are you crying for?
We've all been laid off
We're counting on you to help
That's a relief

How're you holding up?
How was your trip?
How long did you stay there?
How about staying for dinner?
I'm making a big pot of stew
Did you forget to buy eggs?
Did you forget something?
Are you happy right now?
You say that to everyone.
It's almost five.
What happens at five?
You'll have to wait and see.
I don't want to go.
It's your call.
I don't want to work today
You snooze, you lose

Tom wished he hadn't said that
Tom wished he hadn't looked
Tom went window-shopping
Tom went white-water rafting
Tom weighs over 90 kilograms
Tom wasn't listening
Tom wasn't expecting anybody
Tom was John's roommate
Tom was John's cellmate
Tom walked into Mary's house

Tom still doesn't trust Mary
Tom stepped on Mary's foot
Tom squeezed Mary's hand
I'm not worried about Tom
I'm glad Tom was there with me
How young do you think Tom is?
How tall do you think Tom is?
How old do you think Tom is?
Here, let me take a stab at it
It's his word against hers
Translate and shut up!
It's her word against his
Try samba!
Summer is coming soon!
Today isn't my lucky day!
Today is not my lucky day!
Which book do you need?

I'm okay because I'm alive
I'm using a bowl and a spoon
Somebody's inside the house
It's marvellous
Don't make me wait!
Where do you see him?
Come, Hísiel, we follow him!
Stop!
I’m Hísiel
Are you one of the Sindar?
I am!
With whom are you eating?

We hope to meet you at UK97
It's Claudine's house
Do you have a pen?
That's right
I don't see why not

I don't care for his rudeness
Wherever he goes, he lies
We like when you dance!
I'm starting to get old!
Are you still in Scotland?
Sorry, but I can't do so
One day you'll be able to walk
He can't be understood
We're having a party
Don't make a fool of yourself
I can't keep up with you
I'm afraid of the dark
Let's rest for a few minutes
I don't want either of them
Dad, Mary hit me!
What's the meaning of that?
I can't know it
I don't allow it
One must sow one's wild oats
Read!
Do you have a coin?
Do not forget!
Close your mouth!
No?
Isn't it true?
What did you hide?
Where is it located?
Can you use a computer?

We don't know it
Why are you visiting us?
Who is visiting us?
Are you her friend?
Do you know the family?
She doesn't know the truth yet

There is man's best friend!
Is Mary well?
How many apples are there?
How much is an apple?
Yeah, I want you to do it
How do you know each other?
What is the date?
He doesn't want it
Tom shouldn't talk so much
Tom shouldn't have said that
Tom shouldn't have done it
Tom shouldn't have come here
Tom shouldn't be so surprised
Tom shouldn't be so greedy
Tom should've waited for Mary
Tom should've told Mary
Tom should've studied more
Tom should've paged Mary
Tom should've married Mary
Tom should've known
Tom should've known better
Tom should've danced with Mary
Tom should've called
Tom should've been there
Tom should take Mary's advice
Tom should be home by 2:30
Tom shared Mary's pain
Tom says it's up to Mary
Tom saw fear in Mary's eyes
Tom saved Mary's life
Tom paid a $300 fine
Tom owes Mary 300 dollars
Tom liked Mary's new hairstyle
Tom just doesn't understand
Tom just can't stand Mary
Tom hasn't changed a bit
Tom couldn't find the bus stop

Why did you come here today?
Will you come back home soon?
You are too, son!
Fine!

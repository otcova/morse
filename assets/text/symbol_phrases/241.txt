Do you own the house?
No.
Are you a student?
Yes.
Were you a cook on that boat?
No, I wasn't.
Aren't you often home?
No, I'm not.
Did you see that movie?
Yes.
Will you see the museum again?
Yes.
Yes.
Was the dog under the table?
Yes.
Will you see the film tonight?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's doing the best she can
Tom, you're with me
Yes.
Tom's parents came home early
Did you break the lamp?
Did you break the lamp, Tom?
Yes, I will.
Is he in love with you?
Is she in love with you?
Is he in love with you?
I don't know.
I'm not stupid
Fadil didn't question anything
I don't want to get into it
I'm in Egypt
Fadil's health deteriorated
Fadil's mind deteriorated
Within a week, Fadil was dead
Fadil's father-in-law died
Layla is now 13
Please don't start, Layla
You're a worthless husband
It's my money, too
Fadil didn't fit the mold
That was Fadil's goal
I think I'll email my friends
My rock-paper-scissors is weak
I don't like travelling
I don't believe in true love
Do you believe in true love?
Do you believe in soulmates?
If I could help you, I would
Who wants to wash my car?
Loving them isn't enough
I know that you're under 18
The two-state solution is dead
Just finish what you're doing
I'm cautiously optimistic
I'll be done in an hour
What would I do afterwards?
A woman's virtue is everything
I'm wasting my time with you
Layla fell for Fadil's charms
I'm gonna marry you
Fadil took Layla's virginity
That was Fadil's view
Layla's virtue was impregnable
Fadil's reputation was ruined
Fadil's mission was complete
Finding Fadil isn't hard
I'm filing for divorce
That's what made Fadil happy
Layla was grief-stricken
Can you talk?
Who did this to you?
Don't be so pretentious
I'll pick you up around seven
But what if she says no?
But what if he says no?
Come with me, Tom
I've got an idea
I don't want to worry him
I don't want to worry her
I don't want to worry them
You can't keep doing this
Fadil had a 16-year-old sister
You're absolutely beautiful
Layla's love turned to revenge
Fadil set Layla's body on fire
Fadil can't lie very well
Can Fadil get a gun for us?
How about a threesome?
The gang became Fadil's family
Fadil was Rami's new associate
Fadil's grades dropped
Fadil didn't divorce Layla
Fadil was college-educated
How much does Fadil owe you?
Fadil's plan was his downfall
We've got a pair
I'm a music producer
See anything you like?
I'm just shy
You can't tell me what to do!
Nobody knows who's in charge
You can't cheat fate
Would you like tea or coffee?
Neither.
I appreciate Tom's personality
He'll win
Come here!
It's really soft
Have you tried this water?
Whom are you looking for?
Don't you know your name?
Where do you have lunch?
Did you guys sing?
Did you sing?
It's my dictionary
Not bad!
Don't read the comments
He's coming back tomorrow
Tom liked Mary's video
I know you're in there
I know you're in there
Open up!
I know you're in there!
Mary, my love!
It's what they all say
I think that won't work
I don't believe you're right
I wonder who'll win
You should've let me sing
Who convinced Tom to do that?
You're really talented
Where's the beach?
Here's an example
You're very arrogant
Your hair's beautiful
That's quite shocking
You're a patient man
This shouldn't have occurred
Can I smoke in here?
I'll pay you next week
Do we have everything we need?
Who's coming with us?
Call a cab!
Could you call a cab?
Have you ever taught French?
How were the classes?
I don't feel well in churches
What have you done to me?
What have you guys done to me?
Remove the red wire.
I've removed it
Now what?
Who is she really?
Could you help me, sir?
Are you really okay?
Where's my stuff?
What's this line for?
I'm afraid of hospitals
Was he French?
Was it French?
She's wearing an orange dress
I'd like to remain anonymous
Tomorrow is Sunday, isn't it?
Where's the cash?
I knew I'd find you
How did that get in here?
I'll save you all
He's a student
Don't think of an elephant
I'm young, but I'm not stupid
That's so sexist!
I'm glad baboons aren't human
Bread is "pain" in French
That spider needs a haircut!
A flock?
It's very far from here
Fadil was born in Waco, Texas
Fadil's past quickly caught up
We're both OK
We're buddies
We're related
Maybe it's Tom
Who's the boss?
I'm Tom Jackson
I'm not pleased
I've done a lot
Tom can come, too
I'm baking bread
I'm not a singer
I've been chosen
I got mugged, too
I play chess, too
I was mugged, too
I'll be done soon
I'll be safe here
I'll come at 2:30
I'll get it fixed
Tom isn't my uncle
I'll have to wait
I'll need surgery
I'll pay for this
I'll probably win
I'll win for sure
I'm feeling woozy
Tom won't be there
You've done a lot
I'm braver than Tom
I'm counting on Tom
Tom can't hear Mary
I play tennis, too
Tom isn't penniless
Do you understand Spanish?
Do you understand Portuguese?
Do you understand Italian?
She knows it's her obligation
How many Toms do you know?
Is Tom your real first name?
I'm not Swiss
We don't hire women
What are you, a Communist?
How did you sprain your wrist?
What's the wifi password?
That's my seat
Oh, but I already have
Any last words?
Maybe he's busy
I'm sleeping
What am I doing?
I'm trying to sleep!
They're sleeping like babies
Why didn't you come back home?
Do you drink a lot of milk?
Really?
Really already?
Huh?
Do you have your cell on you?
I'll pay today
There's all kinds of people
Did your trip go well?
I'm going until the airport
Wait!
Don't shoot!
What did you wanna do?
Don't think aloud!
I'm worried about Tom's life
I don't believe anyone anymore
I've become sleepy
I'll make an appearance soon
You're not even watching it
I've killed my sister
I don't want any more beer
How much?
Ten bucks.
I'll give you five.
Ten bucks.
How about five?
I'm gonna kill that bitch
Let's move away
Perth is Australia's Wild West
I'm so in love with you
You're a drunk
This won't happen to you again
What are we doing that for?
We're playing a game
Are you ready for some more?
We didn't know what else to do
It's a little hard to take
We can't stay here any longer
Tom isn't a student here
He's one of the teachers
That's where the shoe pinches
Who is his father?
That's how I lost my job
We don't anymore
What is the harm in trying?
Let's get acquainted
What is your patronymic?
Where to go?
Do you love me?
More than anything.
She's very good at it
He's very good at it
She's madly in love with him
He's madly in love with her
What's the harm in trying?
Mary isn't my mother
She's my aunt
She's madly in love with her
He's madly in love with him
Is Arabic difficult?
I don't want to be a bear
Can you all be less noisy?
Could you be quieter?
Could you please be quieter?
Could you please be quieter?
Could you be quieter?
You're not old enough to drive
You'll soon be able to do that
I'm making myself a sandwich
He shouted angrily, "Hey!
You contaminated my water!
Eagles don't hunt flies
You would've loved the concert
You still don't look too tired
You don't seem very happy here
You don't seem very busy today
We should do what you're doing
We don't always do it this way
That'll cost us a lot of money
My mother doesn't speak French
I've hired myself an assistant
I've found myself a girlfriend
I've been expelled from school
I've been arrested three times
I'm younger than you may think
I'm turning thirty next Monday
I'm the owner of this building
I'm pretty sure that we'll win
I'm planning to move to Boston
I'm not very good with numbers
I'm not likely to ever do that
I'm not likely to do that soon
I'm not ever coming here again
I'm likely to be there tonight
I'd rather stay here by myself
I still didn't know what to do
I still believe that'll happen
I probably won't do that again
I hope I didn't offend anybody
I can't bring myself to say no
You're good at making friends
You're fun to play music with
You should do what we're doing
Who's in charge of doing that?
That's actually what happened
People say I'm a good surgeon
I've changed a lot since then
I'm still not very hungry yet
I'm still not quite convinced
I'm still not able to do that
I'm not the one who does that
I'm likely to be busy all day
I'll certainly try to do that
I'd be happy if that happened
I won't let you do that again
I thought you'd fallen asleep
I often don't work on Mondays
I don't want to do that alone
I don't think I'm introverted
I don't often work on Mondays
Have you eaten anything today?
Doing that won't be difficult
Do you wear a uniform to work?
Do you wear a uniform at work?
Did you see anything you like?
You would've loved the movie
Why do you want to stop here?
Why do you like working here?
Why didn't you do that today?
Why did you go back upstairs?
We only have 3 options
I've bought myself a trumpet
I'm unable to help you today
I'm the one who's in a hurry
I'm ready to do that for you
I'm pretty creative, I think
I'm older than you may think
I'm not likely do that today

I don't like women like that
I don't like to speak French
I could've hurt myself today
I could've done that for you
Have you already eaten lunch?
Are you really that gullible?
You're fun to hang out with
You're being very obnoxious
You still haven't done that
You don't sound too worried
Why did you stop doing that?
That'll cost a lot of money
I'm still not all that busy
I'm not bothering you, am I?
I'm neither rich nor famous
I won't talk to you anymore
I think I'm not bad-looking
I think I'm not a bad coach
I think I shouldn't do that
I still don't get the point
I don't usually wear a suit
I don't often make mistakes
I don't have any more water

You're a very brave person
You look like you're tired
You have a plan, don't you?
You don't seem very hungry
Why were you waving a flag?
Why aren't you cooperating?

I can't afford to buy this
I can't afford to buy both
Have you noticed a pattern?
Have you done that already?
French isn't all that hard
Doing that won't take long
Doing that isn't difficult
You've done a lot already
You've arrived very early
You're good at doing that
You're being hypocritical
You still love me, I hope
You look like you're lost
You look like you're busy
You don't seem very happy
You can't keep doing that
It'll cost a lot of money
It'll be tough to do that
I've gotten married again
I've done a lot this week
I'm still getting dressed
I'm not likely to do that

Are you really happy here?
You've made three errors
You're obviously in pain
You're always doing that
You don't seem very busy

I didn't enjoy the movie
I can't help you anymore
I can't do that tomorrow
Doing that won't be hard
Doing that won't be easy
Do you also speak French?
Are you still in college?
Are you still having fun?
You've really done well
You're doing that wrong
Why were you doing that?
Why do you want to stop?
We're all teachers here

I've made many changes
I've lived a hard life
I've hired an attorney
I've filed for divorce
I've filed a complaint
I've emptied the trash

You're a blabbermouth
Tom won't be here until later
You're a big fat liar
Tom wasn't willing to do that
Tom thinks he's a good person
Tom testified at Mary's trial
Tom says he'll do that for me
You look worried, too
Tom never should've done that
You didn't seem angry

Have you heard from Tom again?
I don't eat much meat
I could've died today
I can't work tomorrow
Tom's suitcase is over there

What are you planting?
Which of you people called me?
Who does Tom play?
What's a sankrumi?
I wonder that myself, really.

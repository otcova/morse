Would you leave me alone?
Won't you please do that?
Won't you do that for me?
Will you please sit down?
Will you be leaving soon?
Why can't I go to Boston?
Why are you so sad today?
Tom told me that he's upset
Why are you so depressed?
Tom told me that he's tired
Why am I not on the list?
Tom told me that he's ready
Who's going to the party?
Tom told me that he's first
Who were you eating with?
Tom told me that he's broke
Who told you I'd do that?
Tom told me that he's bored
Who hasn't done that yet?
Tom told me that he's alone
Who brought these grapes?
Tom told me that I'm boring
When may I do that again?
When do you study French?
When did you arrive here?
Tom thinks he's a good cook
What size are your shoes?
What movie did you watch?
We've decided to do that
We won't do that anymore
Tom swears he won't do that
Tom still hasn't apologized
Tom shouldn't do that again
We didn't stay in Boston
Tom should've stayed longer
Tom should've spoken French
Tom should've gone with you
Tom should've been truthful
Was yesterday a cold day?
Tom should've been sleeping
Was it snowing yesterday?
Tom should've been prepared
Was it raining yesterday?
Tom should've been obedient
Tom should've been forgiven
Those don't belong to me
Tom should've been arrested
This umbrella isn't mine
This suitcase isn't mine
These gloves aren't mine
There's a tollgate ahead
The system isn't perfect
That's a sensitive issue
Some things won't change
Should we come to Boston?
Tom says that he'll do that
Tom says he's taught French
Tom says he's learned a lot
Tom says he's good at chess
Please don't do that now
Tom says he'll do just that
Tom says he'd never do that
Tom says he doesn't do that
Our troubles aren't over
Our problems aren't over
Open the package, please
Tom said he's ready to help
Tom said he's in Boston now
Tom said he's been forgiven
Tom said he'll visit Boston
Tom said he'll do that soon
My room isn't very large
Tom said he'd fly to Boston
My room isn't very clean
Tom said he'd do that later
My room isn't like yours
Tom said he wasn't Canadian
Make sure you're on time
Let's visit Boston first
Let's visit Boston again
Let's speak French today
Let's not stay in Boston
Let's go to Boston first
Let's go to Boston again
Tom promised that he'd help
Let's get out of the way
Tom promised that he'd come
Let's do that right away
Tom promised that he'd call
Let's do that next month
Tom promised he'll be there
Tom probably isn't busy now
It's way past my bedtime
It's very creepy in here
It's too late to do that
It's our duty to do that
It's now time to do that
It's not good to do that
It's humid now in Boston
It's foggy now in Boston
It's cold here in Boston
It's almost time for bed
It's a risk worth taking
Is there any coffee left?
Is there any cheese left?
Is it cold now in Boston?
Tom must've wanted to speak
Is doing that prohibited?
Tom must've been frustrated
I've visited Boston, too
Tom must've been frightened
I've visited Boston once
Tom must've been astonished
I've studied French, too
I've seen people do that
I've never taught French
I've left Boston already
I've just visited Boston
I've just read this book
I've just come to Boston
I've got to take it easy
I've finished doing that
I've done that, you know
I've always been on time
I've also studied French
Tom likely won't be on time
I'm willing to cooperate
Tom likely won't be nervous
I'm too tired to do that
Tom left for school at 6:30
I'm the person in charge
I'm smarter than you are
I'm quite good at tennis
I'm not leaving you guys
Tom isn't very conservative
I'm not in my office now
Tom isn't the only survivor
I'm not having much luck
Tom isn't really good to me
I'm not doing that again
Tom isn't likely to be late
I'm glad I could do that
Tom isn't likely to be busy
Tom isn't afraid to do that
I'm afraid of doing that
Tom isn't a student anymore
I'll eat when I'm hungry
I'll do that if possible
I'll die if I don't do that
I'll continue to do that
I'll come to Boston soon
I'd rather do that alone
I'd like to do that here
I'd like a piece of cake
I'd better do that today
I'd be afraid to do that
I wouldn't do that again
I won't make you do that
I won't do that tomorrow
I won't agree to do that
I wasn't there yesterday
I wasn't having much fun
Tom is my neighbor's nephew
I think it'll snow today
I shouldn't do that here
I shouldn't be in Boston
I shouldn't be down here
Tom is able to do that, too
I should've won the race
Tom is a well-known drummer
I should be home by 2:30
I should be back by 2:30
Tom hasn't done that before
I really don't like dogs
Tom has to be ready by 2:30
I really don't like cats
I never said I'd do that
Tom had hip surgery in 2013
I know you're not stupid
I know you're interested
I know you won't do that
I know why you're afraid
I know what's in the bag
I know what that's about
Tom doesn't wish to do that

I know there's a problem
Tom doesn't seem to be here
I know that you're right
Tom doesn't mind doing that
Tom doesn't like to be here
Tom doesn't know where I am
I know that I'm annoying
Tom doesn't deny doing that
Tom doesn't care what we do
Tom doesn't care about that
Tom does that when he's sad
I know I've been lied to
Tom didn't sound optimistic
I know I'm being watched
Tom didn't seem very sleepy
Tom didn't seem too unhappy
Tom didn't seem to be tired
Tom didn't seem to be happy
Tom didn't seem to be drunk
Tom didn't seem to be angry
Tom didn't say you did that
Tom didn't go into the cave
Tom didn't enjoy doing that
Tom didn't agree to do that
Tom didn't actually do that
I hope I don't die alone
I haven't had supper yet
I haven't had dinner yet
I haven't ever done that
I had to go home at 2:30
Tom definitely wasn't happy
Tom could've been a teacher
I guess you're mad at me
I don't watch TV anymore
I don't want to touch it
I don't want this either
Tom can't understand French
I don't trust any of you
Tom can't solve the problem
I don't think it'll rain
Tom can't help us right now
I don't regret saying no
Tom can't do that every day

Tom and I've been very busy
I don't have to know why
Tom and I've become friends
I don't have the measles
Tom and I'll meet you there
I don't have that luxury
Tom and I weren't impressed
I don't have much to say
I don't have an umbrella
I don't eat pork anymore
I don't eat meat or eggs
I don't eat meat anymore
I don't eat dill pickles
I don't care about money
I didn't win the contest
I didn't wash the dishes
I didn't want to go home
Tom and I haven't eaten yet
I didn't want to do this
I didn't want to be last
I didn't want get caught
I didn't want a sandwich
I didn't try hard enough
Tom and I first met in 2013
I didn't talk about that
I didn't suspect a thing
I didn't study yesterday
I didn't stay there long
I didn't read the report
I didn't like what I saw
I didn't like that place
I didn't like that movie
Tom and I aren't happy here
I didn't like being poor

I didn't have permission
I didn't have a good day
I didn't go to the party

I didn't do that so well
I didn't demand anything
I didn't crack any jokes
I didn't comment on that
I didn't call the police
I didn't break any rules
Tom admitted he's done that
I didn't approve of that
Tom's eyes filled with tears
I didn't answer my phone
Tom wouldn't do that again
Tom worked here until 2013
Tom won't make you do that
Tom won't likely be sleepy
Tom won't likely be scared
Tom won't likely be lonely
I can't stand doing that
Tom won't likely be afraid
I can't leave Boston now
Tom won't likely be absent
Tom won't buy that for you
Tom won't be here tomorrow
Tom won't be busy tomorrow
Tom will return after 2:30
I agree that's a problem
How often do you do that?
How do you open this box?
How do you cook potatoes?
How did you go to Boston?
Have I ever deceived you?
Don't try to do that now
Don't scare me like that
Don't park your car here
Don't be late for dinner
Doing that's a good idea
Tom wasn't very suspicious
Tom wasn't very supportive
Tom wasn't very reasonable
Tom wasn't very optimistic
Do you want to come, too?
Tom wasn't very interested
Do you mind if I do that?
Tom wasn't very frightened
Do you like to wear hats?
Do you intend to do that?

Do you ever visit Boston?
Do you do that every day?
Do I have to wear a suit?
Did you say you did that?

Aren't you satisfied yet?
Are you happy to do that?
Are you happy doing that?
Are you good at baseball?
Are you afraid of snakes?
Are banks open on Monday?

You're a terrible coach

You're a natural leader
You're a likable person
Tom still hasn't kissed me
You're a good presenter
Tom still hasn't graduated
You're a good guitarist
You're a good carpenter
Tom shouldn't do that here
You're a fantastic cook
Tom shouldn't be in Boston
You're a bright student
Tom should've left earlier
You're a bad role model
Tom should've been with us
You'll hurry, won't you?
You were polite, I hope
Tom should've been excited
You want one, don't you?
Tom should've been careful
You swore you'd do that
Tom says he's lost his key
Tom said that he'd do that
You hate spinach, right?
You don't drive, do you?
Tom said he's still afraid
You don't drink, do you?
Tom said he's glad to help
Tom said he'd go to Boston
Tom said he wasn't nervous
You didn't cry, did you?
Tom said he wasn't at home
Will you sell that, too?
Will you read this book?
Will you do that or not?
Why are you leaving Boston?
Why did that bother you?
Why are you saying that?
Who's going to meet you?
Who'll do that with you?

Who told you I did that?
Who should go to Boston?

Who bought that for you?
Who are these gifts for?
Which umbrella is yours?
Where's your university?
When will you eat lunch?
What do your parents do?

Tom must've been irritated
We're both very worried
Tom must've been incorrect
We'd better not do that
Tom must've been impressed
Tom must've been exhausted
Tom must've been depressed
Tom must've been concerned
Was yesterday a hot day?
Was it you who did that?
Tom left the house at 6:30
These aren't my glasses
The plan hasn't changed
Tom isn't good at baseball
Tom isn't afraid of losing
That didn't surprise me
Tom isn't a French teacher
Should I write a letter?
Should I come to Boston?
Please don't be nervous
Of course, I'll do that
My shift starts at 2:30
My plan wasn't any good
My plan isn't very good
My parents died in 2013
My mom thinks I'm smart
My dog's name is Cookie
My birthday's next week
Maybe I'll teach French
Maybe I'll study French
Let's not do that today
It's raining where I am
It's not worth the time
It's illegal to do that
It's hot here in Boston
It's cold now in Boston
Is there any sugar left?
Is it hot now in Boston?
Is it fun to do that?
Is it be OK not do that?
I've only tried it once

Tom could've been confused
Tom could've been arrested

Tom can't buy that for you
I know you aren't happy
I know that I'm correct
I know that I'm adopted
I know that I can't win
I know I'm a bad dancer
Tom and I do as we're told
Tom and I aren't ready yet

Tom says he'll be careful
Have you seen my father?
Tom says he won't help us
Tom says he isn't worried
Don't you still do that?
Don't you like to dance?
Tom said, "Let's do that.
Don't go anywhere alone
Tom said, "Don't do that.
Don't forget to do that
Don't eat anything else
Doing that's a bad idea

What did that sign say?
We won't do that today
We won't do that again
We didn't visit Boston
Was it humid yesterday?
Was it foggy yesterday?
They didn't have roses
These pens aren't mine
That's not worth doing
That's a safety hazard
That isn't quite right
Should we go to Boston?
My rifle wasn't loaded
Tom hasn't had supper yet
My father died in 2013
Tom hasn't done that much
Tom hasn't complained yet
Men sometimes cry, too
May I do that tomorrow?
Let's not visit Boston

I can't play the piano
I can't cook very well
How often are you sick?
How often are you here?
Tom must've been jealous
Don't you teach French?
Tom must've been furious
Don't speak French, OK?
Tom must've been excited
Don't say anything now
Tom must've been curious
Don't play in the road
Don't open the windows
Don't leave Boston yet
Don't do that that way
Don't close the window

Do you like to do that?
Tom isn't such a bad guy
Do you ever wear a hat?
Tom isn't faster than me
Do both of you do that?
Tom isn't afraid anymore
Did you fix everything?
Tom isn't a great player
Can you come to Boston?
Can I do that with you?
Can I do that tomorrow?
Can I buy that for you?
Be sure to do that, OK?
Are you having any fun?
Are you afraid of mice?
Tom is retired, isn't he?
You've got to do that
You're good at tennis
You're a true patriot
Tom is my neighbor's son
You're a stubborn boy
You're a real patriot
You're a quiet person
You're a lousy kisser
You're a little weird

You're a handsome guy
You're a great father
You're a good speaker
You're a good pitcher
You're a good painter
You're a good husband
You're a good drummer
You're a good athlete
You'd love doing that
You'd hate doing that

Will you sing with us?
Will you be all right?
Whose socks are these?
Who's that over there?
Who's calling, please?
Who'll do that for us?
Who wishes to do that?
Who is this money for?
Who else spoke French?
Who drew this picture?
Who drank from my cup?
Who did you swim with?
Who did that with you?
Who brought the salad?
Which team is winning?
Tom doesn't seem wealthy
Which side is winning?
Tom doesn't seem unhappy
Which jacket is yours?
Tom doesn't ever do that
Which helmet is yours?
Tom doesn't do that well
Tom doesn't do that here
When will you do that?
When should I do that?
When do you eat lunch?
We'll keep doing that
We'll arrive tomorrow
We won't ever do that
Tom died in October 2013
Tom didn't seem too busy
Tom didn't pay his share
We don't teach French
Tom didn't pass the test
We don't study French
Tom didn't lock the door
Tom didn't expect to win

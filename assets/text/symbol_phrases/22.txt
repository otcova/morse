We're all college students
You don't work hard enough
Are you watching YouTube?
You don't need to do more work
Do you genuinely want to know?
I'm not ashamed of him
I'm not ashamed of her
I'm ashamed of her
I'm not singling you out
He's always looking at me
We won, thanks to you
Who sent Tom there?
It was me who sent Tom there.
You second-guessed yourself
Don't try it again
Will Tom stop doing it?
I'm baking bread with Tom
I'm making brownies with Tom
I'm sending it over with Tom
We're sunning ourselves
We're basking in the sun
What do you make of all that?
He's in his early fifties
Hurry, you lot
We don't want to miss it
Ring me when you're there
Phone me when you're there
Don't overflatter a child
I love, love, love you!
I love you!
I love you more!
I love you!
I love you tenfold!
All class, line up!
It's time to go outside!
Don't stand on the table
Don't stand on the chair
Shrimp abound here, too
Ziri's dog had some disease
Ziri didn't notice the deer
Ziri passed Rima's door
Ziri's sister lived with us
It's still warm outside
Ziri hasn't seen anybody there
Ziri's friend was freaked out
The water is all Ziri's
You're my savior
They couldn't find their dogs
Delete it!
Do you have any questions?
No, sir.
Any questions?
Negative.
I've found somebody to help us
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
So am I.
I'm never going to quit
There's plenty of space
It's the bitter truth
I've never been so ashamed
Just don't look down!
Is Ziri keeping you up again?
What's keeping you up so late?
Unlike me, Rima is a beauty
Ziri has faith.
But I'm patient.
Ziri crossed the river.
I fell in the mud.
Ziri is patient.
Totally unlike me.
Who can explain me this?
Is she your new girlfriend?
No!
Explain me, then.
How do you explain this child?
Can you explain me this child?
You don't control this
You can't control this
You can't control that
You can't come with me today
Don't use that as a threat
Is this working for you?
Have you heard that one?
Why should Ziri listen to you?
You're a parent
You are an adult, aren't you?
You're still in control
Why should your kids do that?
Don't yell at your kids
Don't yell at your children
Answer that, Ziri
Why do you argue?
Why do you argue all the time?
Don't argue with a kid
Don't argue with your kids
Go to bed.
But Dad...
You don't have to argue
You don't have to like it
Trust me, this works
You've got work tomorrow
Tom shouldn't have done it
What was she wearing?
How big is the universe?
It doesn't look like a set
Which ball is the smallest?
Why do we need to eat?
OK, fine, tell me
Don't say it exactly like that
Are you having fun with this?
Are you having fun with that?
Does that sound like you?
Don't react in anger
Don't react at all
You're already working hard
Oh, you skinned your knee
That hurts...
Of course that hearts!
You're a beautiful woman.
And you're a handsome man.
I'm on to him
I've got him figured out
Tom didn't touch his dinner
Your mother doesn't work here
You're not even listening!
Why did you take offence?
Why were you offended?
Why did you feel hurt?
I don't know about now
I think Tom should do that.
Why Tom?
Are you a beginner?
Do you still remember Mary?
Do you like popcorn?
Are there any side effects?
Don't dig up the past
Don't diminish people
Don't overpersonalize things
Don't wash a hot pan
Next time, say it to my face
Don't smoke out of my window
Rima's hair was in a towel
Ziri peed in Rima's room
You didn't take it
That's on you
Ziri didn't take that nicely
Ziri didn't take that lightly
This person doesn't exist
Have they dried yet?
Who thinks that way?
Why is he going to the park?
Why does he go to the park?
I'm forced to study
Did you like her?
How old are you?
I am eighty-nine years old.
My cat's really sneaky
Maybe it was Tom after all?
The next thing I say?
Did you commit ecocide today?
Let's build a hut
Don't get wise
Don't get smart
What will you do tomorrow?
I'm going to the beach.
Mary's words put Tom at ease
Why do you study Interlingua?
Because it's so easy.
He's buying all the horses
We are brothers, you and I
Our parents won't let us meet
They're all great sprinters
Where are you reading that?
Eighth line from the bottom.
I don't want this, but that
I don't want this, I want that
The Goddess keeps score, too
Why do you hate NATO?
Why are you yelling like this?
You're going to notice that
Do you have to yell?
Do you have to yell this much?
You're free to decide
Don't get pushed into that
My bun's coming undone
Do you want to be one of them?
There's yoghurt in the fridge
I don't like these cups
When did you marry?
Let's get a move on
We've got no time to lose
Don't turn the light out
Don't switch the light off
Don't turn out the light
I'll have time in ten minutes
I've got time now
Which fruit do you like most?
Is Mr Freeman there?
He can't come
He's ill
I've left your tea in the oven
I don't know.
She's got a lot of work to do
Tom can't outsmart me
Tom can't fix it by himself
You're supposed to go with Tom
We did it with Tom's help
Tom shouldn't have done that
He'll regret it
Do you still remember Tom?
Come and sit with us!
Come and sit with me!
Is that also related?
That won't surprise anybody
Tom said, "Are you stupid?
I quit!
I'm free tomorrow
I'll be done working tomorrow
These are my soiled underwear.
I think you're a good player
It's in the middle of nowhere
I'm planing a board right now
You think this is astronomy?
Out of the question!
You're none too early
Don't get pushed into a corner
Fight back!
That's normal, isn't it?
For sure!
Who has the other?
Are you sitting on the rug?
You can't go over your boss
Are you sitting on the carpet?
I'm roasting the big blue fish
Am I shadowbanned?
Ok, I lied
Mrs. Wood is an excellent cook
What is your bliss?
What is radiation?
What is cosmic radiation?
What is a graph database?
Plants are toxic, you know?
Do you see what I mean?
What is the heliosheath?
How are webpages helpful?
Sorry, but it's true
I'm horrible at small talk
What isn't new?
Why are you so sarcastic?
Something else?
He can't help it most days
Yes, I took bribes
I'm corrupt and a criminal
Where doesn't it hurt?
Are you experiencing any pain?
Did you bring the book?
Oh, I forgot it!
Have you brought that book?
Oh, I've forgotten it!
Do you have something to read?
I'm divorcing Rima.
What?!
Are you out of your mind?
What's that rainbow flag
Are you one of those people?
What's that rainbow flag
Are you one of them, too?
Oh, fuck off
I love Janet Jackson's voice
You're a good parent
Could you be a better parent?
Algeria isn't in debt distress
Ukraine's economy has crashed
BDS started in 2005
Is Israel a religious state?
Is Israel a theocracy?
It's all in the Bible.
Is Israel a theocracy?
I believe in the Bible.
Is famine looming for Morocco?
Can you send me some cash?
Can you lend me some cash?
Mom?
Yeah.
Fuck you, dude!
Mom died four months ago.
No shit!
It's all your fault!
You know what?
You're on your own now
Just leave me alone.
Go with me, Tom
Tom didn't pay the deposit
Do your duty, come what may
Could I speak to Mr. Smith?
One moment, please.
Why did you not obey him?
How do you learn a language?
I don't know.
I promised I'd return soon
Yes, that's where you're wrong
It's a lethal dose
Do you have dessert?
When did democracy arise?
What filth!
How I love him!
That's not your book
It's mine
Ziri's life is back on track
The bug dug into Ziri's skin
Ziri cut off the fly's wings
Suddenly, the lights went out
Ziri's toys were broken
Ziri's robot took Rima down
Ziri fired at Rima's leg
Ziri's living room was trashed
It's not Ziri's fault
What does love mean to you?
What does trust mean to you?
Ziri can't read Rima's mind
What causes this fear?
Ziri has low self-esteem
Ziri isn't helping
Ziri's dad was there
Ziri influenced Rima's life
It's just in Ziri's head
Ziri isn't going to come home
A divorce isn't a good thing
Ziri's feelings don't matter
It is not Ziri's fault
Ziri can't heal Rima
Ziri didn't have to do that
Ziri's app is completely free
Ziri could be Rima's soulmate
Ziri doesn't quite get that
Ziri doesn't have any power
Ziri isn't perfect
Ziri doesn't need other people
Ziri doesn't need those people
Don't allow Tom out
What kind?
That'll be 250 yen.
What?
Here.
Hey, don't hog them all up!
Leave some for me, too
Tom and I haven't gotten ready
What is destiny?
My friend, sleep is important
Don't get into Tom's way!
I'm sorry that I got caught
My t-shirt is soaked in sweat
What does Algeria want?
God isn't an American cowboy
What does "woke culture" mean?
Start over, please!
Please start over!
She'll lend you hers
Australia isn't an island
How are knives sharpened?
Throw that away, please
She won't be the one singing
I like to wear my hair up.
In what style?
Oh, usually a bun or ponytail
Nothing too fancy.
Let's buy something!
Did we interrupt anything?
Now kiss!
What's your grievance?
Why is pinball so addictive?
Did you see any ghosts?
I'm contemplating buying gin
I've just been talking to Tom
You surprise me, sir
How would you compare the two?
Why is the other cushion torn?
Why has this problem arisen?
Why did you tell me?
Why are you not at work?
What will become of my people?
What was on the paper?
What shall we do now?
What is your stance on this?
What is your progress?
What is property?
What is my function?
What if we all joined forces?
What have we become?
What dose is required?
Nowt gets past you!
You've done nowt
What do you suggest, then?
What do you advise, sir?
What did you stop it for?
You fancy coming?
Aye, why not?
I've got nowt better on.
What color is your parachute?
What can it mean?
What are the pros and cons?
What a devastating indictment!
Mrs Sato rang at 11 o'clock
Ms Sato rang at 11 o'clock
Mrs Sato phoned at 11 o'clock
Ms Sato phoned at 11 o'clock
I owe you an apology.
I don't see why.
Ugh, Mum!
Boys are totally disgusting!
Where did it come from then?
Don't leave, Mary!
I love you!
Oh, poppycock!
You only think you do!
Who went first?
Who maintains this repository?
Who knows where the time goes?
Return?
Yes, please.
Who has the ace of spades?
Who did you hear it from?
Who authorized that?
Who am I to argue?
She's in the mood for dancing
He's no longer the same man
He's too timid to try
He's too scared to try
How does my voice sound?
How did you go?
How can I help you, madam?
Today is 2nd January
We'd better sit here
He's married to an air hostess
Have you tasted the soup here?
He's really nice!
Have you ever thought that?
Seriously?
Yes, seriously.
Ziri's sister was sleeping
Forty euros for a scarf?
Will you turn it off?
Will you let me finish?
Will you go with me?
Will you do it, or shall I?
Are you strong enough?
Say what you're thinking
Are you on the guest list?
Are you into graphs?
Are you an adult?
Was it at all like this?
Was it a good idea?
It's a time-consuming task
Turn right here, please
I'm not arrogant
I'm right
She's in town here
Skura takes four.
Marry her.
Why?
It's a genuine Gucci.
Please!
I will never forgive you, Ziri
Get in line, weirdo
Ziri's dad spoils him rotten
What's your name?
Coca.
What drink?
Nice to meet you, Coca
My name is Ziri.
Don't you trust me?
Not really.
Who are you?
Your worst nightmare.
Just run!
Still don't believe me?
Have you washed the sink?
You're both so pretty
Have you ever been to Algiers?
You're really good with babies
You didn't even look at Ziri
You must be Ziri's stepmom
Nice to meet you!
Can you drop this act, please?
Stop apologizing all the time!
Teachers don't make much money
Is the TV bothering you?
My brother's outside
You're a dummy
I was sick, so I stayed home
It's become a bit cloudy
I'd like to drink some water
It's an old Japanese movie
No, it doesn't hurt
No, it's not spicy
No, it's not hot
Yes, I want to know, too
The weather's not good today
That's today's paper
That's today's newspaper
I'd like to drink some hot tea
I'd like a hot cup of tea
It's cheap but very nutritious
It's windy and cold
You can't enter this room
Yesterday's test was easy
Tom and I aren't yet ready
Let's buy something to eat
Let's buy something to drink
Let's buy something
I can't get this knot untied
Tom's debts are increasing
Why is Tom always hungry?
This pear isn't ripe yet
Will there be anyone else?
When do services take place?
Every Sunday at ten.
Let's not act rashly
Why act rashly?
You're really good at your job
You still love Tom, don't you?
What's your stance on this?
Will you be staying long?
He's a very honest lad
Here's the house he lived in
How long were you ill?
How long were you ill for?
Has Mary already started?
Fill it in, please
All sold out.
Have you booked a hotel room?
It's rotten weather
It's rubbish weather
It's foul weather
It's miserable weather
Let's listen to the cassette
The film begins at ten o'clock
Let's go to the seaside
I get up at 7:30
I'll order this dish
I've climbed that mountain
I don't really like studying
I didn't remember that person
I didn't remember him
I didn't remember her
Been here long?
It's not any good
Can you beat it?
Can you beat my score?
Is it economical?
That's natural
Whose men are you?
Is it gluten-free?
That's admirable
That's the name
What's this one?
It's a good day
It'd be too late
I'll catch a bus
OK, hand it here
Can you tow my car?
Does it make sense?
Be optimists, boys
Can I help you pack?
Well, that's fine
No, thanks, old man
Gosh, I'm thirsty
Now, you understand
Ah, I understand
Well, I don't know
Where'd you get it?
Oh, that's too bad!
Sorry, I missed that
Obviously I'm biased
Is it tax deductible?
Do you have a spouse?
OK, that's not it
It's a simple story
Now that's too much
Hey, don't go there
OK, that seems fair
Do you have allergies?
I can't see clearly
Can you cut me a deal?
Oh, it's you, is it?
Is that crazy or what?
Yes, that's not bad
It's that much junk
That's a novel idea
Don't tell the boys
I'm quite all right
I'll get the tickets
That's the main idea
Here's a joke I like
I've got indigestion
Cold hands, warm heart
Please don't be lazy
Well, what do you want?
Can you interpret this?
Can I borrow your bike?
Let's drop the pretense
Why can't you get it?
Do you value your hide?
Now, do you understand?
I'll give you a break
I don't like coconuts
OK, I'll remind you
I must've been asleep
So, what do you propose?
It was on my to-do list
It's on my nightstand
Well, it's a good gag
How did Tom contribute?
You're spoiling her
You've spoiled him rotten
You're suspended for a month
Please forgive me.
I already have.
Please, Ziri, forgive me.
I already have, Rima..
I already have.
Ziri didn't have time for that
Ziri's best friend was Walid
Rima's baby has never died
You're a selfish moron
Why do you look so upset?
Ziri doesn't know this school
Ziri didn't expect any less
Ziri has betrayed you.
That's the reaction I want
You're never coming back here
He isn't qualified for that
I'm not ashamed to admit it
I made it.
I have a test tomorrow.
Are your legs tired?
Long-sleeved kimono?
Hakama?
Suit?
Typically, the toilet is white
Yesterday's class was long
Don't say disreputable things
How long were you in Caracas?
Yes, that's true
Here's an apple
We had lunch with Tom's boss
The apple isn't ripe yet
There's one apple left
Are those apples?
No, they're oranges.
There's an apple on the bench
I'm eating my apple
There's an apple on the table
He doesn't eat apples
Here's the apple I found
Tell me where it's located
I was surprised, too
I'm curious, too
I'd be interested, too
I'd be interested in that, too
How to know?
I've got a good lawyer
But I don't understand
One can't be too careful
It's a brave new world
How'd the operation go?
How did the operation go?
It's still a bit early
Can we arrange a meeting?
Who's brought the cake?
I can't tolerate lying
I can't understand that
Can you learn to love me?
That's when I tried it
I'll bet it's a summons
They'd never let you go
Wow, this is a nice table!
Aw man, that's terrible!
For a moment, no one spoke
It's all in a days work
Yes, that would do nicely
Which version do you have?
Is this some sort of test?
I'll have to check it out
All right, get on with it
I can't wait for summer!
Where's the art gallery?
Well, what's to be done?
Do you want to sell online?
I've never seen it done
I'm supposedly laid off
I can't please everybody
I'll talk to you tonight
Did you change detergents?
Ziri's voice echoed back
Ziri put on Walid's costume
Seriously, Ziri, grow up
I'm not attracted to him
Are you a lesbian?
You don't know my type
Are you one of them?
You mean gay?
Yeah.
What makes you think I'm gay?
She kissed me on my lips.
I think Rima is lesbian.
Ziri put Rima's dad in jail
It was just a reflex.
Let's make that a habit.
Tom wasn't wearing a cap
I don't know Tom's whereabouts
The next day, Feb
Do you speak Macedonian?
Yes, but I'm rusty.
Do you speak Macedonian?
Yes, but it's been a while.
So what did you mean by that?
What exactly did she tell you?
Are you vaccinated?
Are you vaxxed?
My plane's tomorrow morning
Where's her office?
Mark my words!
You're not a very good learner
You're not a bad learner
You're not a good learner
Good morning, gentlemen
Yeah, I'm talking to you
Don't argue with me here
A citation wasn't needed
So, where's the necklace?
Is this a picture of a cat?
I'll have a taco, please
I hope it won't hurt you
Now, where are my eyedrops?
It's the aurora borealis
Don't you see I hate you
Can you record this for me?
The delay won't hurt now
This won't do, gentlemen!
Don't tell me to give up
The war, however, was lost
However, this is incorrect
Is it something infectious?
Don't you want me to stay?
Please don't be concerned
Don't forget to add basil
The project was short-lived
Here, let me show you again
OK, I think I can do that
Please don't say any more
It was all right, after all
Exactly what is it you want?
Who won last night's game?
So, how do you explain that?
That's good enough, right?
Just how big is that closet?
They'll be here any minute
We'll have to satisfy them
Hmm, that does seem difficult
It's either all or nothing
Grab your rucksack and hurry!
We can't undo our mistakes
Anything I can help you with?
Life is very sad, isn't it?
You're beating a dead horse
Well, after that it's easy
All those in favor, say "Aye.
It's all right," I said
We didn't get the necklace
You're very well prepared
You don't remember well
Don't be so cute!
What should I do?
It's the only name I've got
A man's house is his castle
That's her speciality
That's their speciality
We're going tomorrow afternoon
I'd like to pay cash
I'd like to pay in cash
Who's that playing the piano?
Isn't that boring?
Have you got a sharpener?
Could you sharpen it, please?
How many of you are coming?
How many of you are going?
She's French
Françoise comes from France
Is the museum open daily?
They'd like to pay cash
They'd like to pay in cash
I'll take attendance
Are you named after a saint?
I'm going to take attendance
Now he's got it
I'm not worrying about them
I don't see how it can fail
Can we discuss it like adults?
It's cheap as chips
Do you worry about pesticides?
Can I take Berber classes?
What's this thing called?
You take after Ziri, you know
Ziri's hair came off
Ziri was walking out of a café
Hey!
Can you calm down?
This is Rima, my sister!
Ziri's eyes welled up
Ziri ran off, grinning
Ziri took off his shirt, too
What'd you do?
It's rather early
That's our appeal
Today is my wife's birthday
Tell him I'm waiting for him
Now he's Sviatopolk
Tom didn't want to hinder them
You're still a good reporter
That wasn't at all necessary
There's simply nothing to it
Don't eat any dinner tonight
Climate change is real, people
I stared at the man, astounded
You'd better get your friends
My mother has type 2 diabetes
I don't need a bag
I don't want a bag
I'm not going to go to school
I'll be absent from school
Unfortunately, I can't do that
You can't live on bread alone
I'll have an Espresso, please
I'd prefer not to get drunk
I'm as much a prisoner as you
That's a very cosy living room
We'd better put them on notice
When I'm sleepy, I go to bed
When I'm sleepy, I sleep
Don't tell papa
It's about women
It's so well done
But who is the enemy?
But what can be done?
It's in a rural area
Rima is in bed with...
Yeah, with...?
She's in bed with...
Yeah!!!
Speak!!!
With who?
Ziri broke up with Rima, too
I'm so disappointed in you
Who would say no to you?
So, cheer up
Oh, the irony!
You mean there's someone else?
Why doesn't it emit any light?
I'm here to do whatever I can
I think they're terrific
We've always had the best
How long is summer vacation?
What will happen without me?
That pattern hasn't changed
That'll be a disappointment
Get off me, you sicko!
Ziri's anger calmed down
Just then, Ziri popped up
You're at every football game
However, they soon parted ways
Allegedly, the note was burned
Tom likes tea, doesn't he?
It's just stopped raining
It's been very, very enjoyable
Will Tom be here this evening?
I really love half-price sales
No, you can't do that
It's a myth
Can you cut my hair?
Can you give me a haircut?
You've got to be kidding me.
Unfortunately, I'm not
That's what Tom said.
Yes, what is it?
I need a better office.
Mommy, can I have some water?
Ask properly, please.
Of course you may.
Some kids will be upset.
Why don't you eat meat?
No way.
Really?
Sounds brutal.
I'm not going shopping today
You're a slow learner
What are you up to, Tom?
Tell Tom I'm waiting for him
That's his playbook
May we come in?
May we enter?
No, that's wrong
Yeah, sure
How do you use these?
That's a nice outfit
Made it!
Tom's cell phone rang
I wasn't afraid of anything
I wasn't scared of anything
Who reported it?
Who reported that?
Who reported the robbery?
Who filed the complaint?
Hey, let's go home
Here's a news flash
Can you move out of the way?
Is it safe to drink that much?
All of you, get out
You're gonna regret this
With this, Ziri walked away
Ziri's face suddenly lit up
Hearing that, Ziri stormed off
Ziri sat across Rima, grinning
Why don't you look up?
Please, just get out of my way
Who did that?
Spit it out!
Hey, get off
That's Ziri's car
With that, Ziri walked out
Why were you spying on me?
I'm glad Tom found his keys
But there's nothing else here
It's the easiest way
We're glad that Tom isn't here
We're glad Tom isn't here
I don't want to lose this game
I've got a horrible cold today
Just tell me when you're ready
It's not a bug
It's a feature
Why did they kidnap Tom?
Who are we going to support?
Tomorrow I'll start school
I'm not tired of being married
Who can I speak to about this?
Who should I speak to?
Who can I talk to about this?
Which shoes will you buy?
Who will you meet tomorrow?
Who are you meeting tomorrow?
Who are you seeing tomorrow?
Who will you see tomorrow?
If it's close by, walk
If it's close, walk
If it's close, let's walk
If it's near, let's walk
How was the movie yesterday?
How was yesterday's movie?
Explain what?
When are you coming back?
To take away?
No, to eat in.
It could've been even worse
Are you getting this bus?
No, I'm waiting for the next.
Tom, is that you?
No, it's not me.
I did invite you!
How did you manage that?
I don't know myself.
I would've come to pick you up
Can you lend me some money?
What are your favorite things?
Two hundred euros.
How much did you fork out?
Two hundred euros.
There it is!
No, I want it to be tidy.
He can't wait to be there
I hate it.
No, not really.
What does 'not really' mean?
It means no!
Does Tom still drink?
Mr Miller, I presume.
I assume you're Mr Miller.
Yes, that's me
And who are you?
I think Mary likes you.
What makes you think that?
Oh?
Anything serious?
A bit.
I've got time now.
Well, it's about Tom
Why do you do that?
Which did you do?
You've changed since then
Don't yell at Mom

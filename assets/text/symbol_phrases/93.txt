Could you please help me?
Would you do something for me?
Do you have a minute?
I'll make you some
Hey, you
Hey, where are you going?
Want to hear something funny?
I've just finished lunch
I'm about to leave
I've just washed the dishes
I'm busy at the moment
It is just five o'clock
I've just been to the bank
I've just finished packing
I'm just about to check in
Just then, the bus stopped
Just then, the telephone rang
Let's get out of here
Don't hesitate
Can I change the channel?
Turn to channel 1
How do I get to Chinatown?
Don't be mean with the tip
I don't have a ticket
I'd like to book three seats
Where can I buy tickets?
Where can I get tickets?
Do you have any tickets left?
The tickets are 20 yen each
Chicken, please

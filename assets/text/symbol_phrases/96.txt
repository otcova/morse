What is that huge building?
Is that machine still usable?
Don't call that student a fool
That gray building?
What's that flower?
How beautiful that flower is!
That song's bound to be a hit
What was that noise?
How did you like that movie?
That movie stinks!
Look at those clouds!
It's going to rain
Where has that memo got to?
Was all of that milk drunk?
I'm staying at that hotel
Let's sit down on that bench
Don't sit on that bench
How high is that building?
Want to go see?
It's next to that building
I'd like that beer, please
Look at that good-looking boy
Whose notebook is that?
It's made of fine cotton
Who is that lady?
May I eat that cake?
Who is that pretty girl?
I'm dying for that camera
I think we're out of your size
Will that idea come off?

Did Tom say he loved me?
You aren't better than me
We're songwriters
What scared Tom?
Tom doesn't ever swear
This isn't our stop
I won't survive this
Good Heavens!
She won't help us
It won't help Tom
Why don't you write to Tom?
Why didn't you write to Tom?
Have you heard back from Tom?
I've already written to him
I haven't written to Tom yet
I've already written to her
I've already written to them
I've already called everyone
What if Tom sees us?
Have you written to everyone?
Have you called everyone?
I've written to everyone
I've called everyone
I've called everyone I know
Does Tom really love me?
Unfortunately, Tom didn't come
We're hairdressers
Was your father an only child?
I'll let Tom tell you himself
Don't cut yourself
You're an imbecile
Is it good or bad?
Why don't we stop Tom?
What did they eat?
I'm a little stiff
I won't apologize to Tom
What's an isosceles triangle?
What's a right triangle?
Is it Monday today?
What games does she like?
I bet I'll see them
It's not worth saying
I've got my fog lights on
I'll sit on the couch
In all likelihood, I'll win
I'm likely to win
I'll bring you up to date
Is Tom much older than you?
Don't lock me out
Boys only, no girls allowed
Girls only, no boys allowed
We were promoted to Division 1
What a storm!
I don't think it'll come today
Tom wants to talk to you, too
Alright, don't be long
I'm interested, too
This fish doesn't taste good
There's no truth to that rumor
That rumor isn't true
Will Tom pay for it all?
I'd like you to rely on me
You're a free man
Tom's testimony was false
Are these Tom's things?
Where's the chapel?
How much will I be paid?
No doubt you'll like this
The door's stuck
I've been single for years
So many stores!
Looks like you're happy
I can see you're happy
I feel like I'm bothering you
That test's too hard
It's a great pleasure
I don't get along with my boss
Whose son is he?
Whose son is this?
It'll depend on the context
I haven't heard it before
You've warned me already
It's written in lowercase
That's not how it's said
That's not how you say it
She's a good student
Tom won't tell anyone
For here or to go?
Dine-in or take-out?
Don't read that book
Don't read that book
Guess who Tom bet on?
She's good at the piano
Here's the bathtub
I'm going with my friends
What's the jacket made of?
You weren't on time
It'll be dreadfully hot
It'll be really hot
It'll be very hot
It'll be quite hot
It wasn't a big store, was it?
It's a very big store
It's the answer that's hard
Who's Tom working with?
We're guests
2013 is the year I was born
Do the same thing I'm doing
You've grown a lot
Doesn't Tom trust Mary?
Would you wear this?
How many apples?
It looks like you're happy
When will Tom be arriving?
You're all idiots
How many apples did Tom eat?
How big is your office?
I couldn't kill anybody
That won't help Tom
I'm not closing them
You'll survive me
Text me?
Why did you deceive Tom?
What I can do?
I'm a train without tracks
Don't give up on me
I promise I'll be good
Are you approaching me?
Is that a JoJo reference?
Why isn't Tom at work?
You eat fruit, don't you?
Will Tom stay or leave?
You aren't my wife
What's in store for us?
Who taught you how to aim?
Look!
Why's Tom grumbling?
What's Tom been accused of?
We don't give discounts
Next month is Tom's birthday
Is it raining again?
Don't take Tom seriously
What's democracy?
I forgot what it's called
Where's Tom moving?
You think so, too, don't you?
I'm looking for a partner
How's Tom's elbow?
Who disagrees?
Tom doesn't like raspberries
I probably won't go today
I'll try to get rid of Tom
What is this?
This is a peach.
He said "yes
I'm going to have to stop Tom
Go see who's here
I'm the youngest here
Tom wasn't hiding
I'm not joking, Tom
You won't fool me
Tom didn't answer my call
Is the computer plugged in?
Is Tom eating a sandwich?
Is anybody else coming?
What scared Tom off?
Tom doesn't like to fish
He's going to be happy
None of this is Tom's fault
You'd better tell us the truth
I'm sure Tom has a pension
Do these gloves fit you?
How long did Tom sleep?
You know that isn't the case
She didn't get married
He's not dangerous
I don't like ironing
Will Tom agree?
You can't stay here forever
She didn't lose any time
This plane is huge!
We're a bit skeptical
I don't know when she'll come
I'll check on that tomorrow
He's often taken it up the ass
Do you meet with Tom often?
They left at what time?
God shave the queen!
Tom hasn't confessed
How is vodka made?
I'm watching a video now
I'm going to cum
I'm fed up watching television
He's the son of my sister
He's my nephew
Where can I study Galician?
Where is the mouse?
How was today?
Can you pass me some paper?
Can't we go faster?
He's not a natural brunette
Run an in route after 10 yards
What does Tom think of me?
I'm putting you in as goalie
What's your LINE ID?
Let's trade LINE IDs
What's your LINE?
He's an age regressor
You were cold, weren't you?
We won't forget your kindness
That one isn't ours
When will Tom be home?
I'll be using a shirt
This isn't a myth
I'm ashamed of my father
I didn't contradict Tom
Tom should've done it
Does Tom come by often?
We'll follow suit
I had a child, but he died
Will Tom attend the meeting?
You wouldn't need to stay long
Do you really like Tom?
It's just us
Tom's hair is red
It's best you stay in bed
Whose keys are those?
Because they hadn't seen it
How many copies do you want?
A teaspoon, please
He's not my dad, he's my uncle
We'll rest afterwards
Can I sleep for a bit?
I'll be out in a bit
There's no more
They're at a party
This much heat isn't normal
That's how I remember Tom
You're putting on some weight
I'm not your professor
Why don't you like it now?
It's cold in the winter
Are you in China?
It's freedom of speech
Your tummy's growling
How bad do you have to go?
How many sodas did you have?
But I didn't draw a hat
We're detectives
Tom's not ticklish
Tom doesn't like being tickled
Tom's allergic to shellfish
Mary's a tomboy
What's your pen pal's name?
Back of the line!
I'm going to buy a camera
How do I register to vote?
Tell Tom where you'll be
Why should I vote?
How can I be informed?
Is this a trustworthy source?
Are they non-partisan?
Why are we so divided?
When's Election Day?
Am I old enough to vote?
Am I too old to vote?
Am I allowed to vote?
Who can I call?
Who should I trust?
Who can I trust?
How will I know who to trust?
How much should I trust them?
Where can I learn more?
Is furigana available?
What's the stroke order?
That's an outdated term
I know it's Tom calling
I'd prefer to do it that way
You didn't do that right
Relax, nobody's perfect
Suddenly, Tom stopped
You aren't my son
Who tied Tom up?
I'll be tied up all afternoon
We're bookworms
I can't see the dog
You're stronger than I am
You're a big jerk
Was that an expensive suit?
The girl's name is Mary
I'll definitely go to Tom
So, what's next?
What's your job description?
Am I the last?
I won't likely change my mind
You're as short as I am
You're as short as me
You're as tall as me
I'm not hurting you, am I?
That's a small tree
That's a very tall tree
You don't seem too satisfied
I'd like to take a nap
Can I have that apple?
Can I have these apples?
Should we ask Tom for help?
I was glad Tom wasn't there
I ordered you a salad, too
I ordered a salad for you, too
What are they?
Would you wear that?
I still don't know a lot
You've saved me again
Tom doesn't dress well
Whose wallet is this?
I'll buy some food
How urgent is it?
I'll go and see how Tom is
Now, you sing
Tom needs to agree, too
I'll leave after Tom gets here
You aren't sure, are you?
Was Tom warned?
Who lives above you?
I'm sure this isn't Tom's
Don't you know Tom well?
Tom followed Mary's example
See if Tom's light is on
Where's my badge?
I won't change my plans
How did Tom manage to escape?
Tom was born in Australia, too
You've put on some weight
There's no more beer
There's no more milk
There's no more butter
There's no more sugar
There's no sugar left
Could you come today?
Tom, leave it alone
Did Tom manage to escape?
Whose cat is this?
When can Tom do that?
Did you drink it all?
My dad doesn't drink anymore
The car is old, but it's good
There's someone in the house
There's somebody in the house
You'd better stay away
It wasn't Tom, but his brother
There's nobody in the house
Are they Canadians?
Tom doesn't listen to the news
I'll put Tom on the train
You're being very selfish
Is that a turtle?
How do you tolerate Tom?
When should I expect you?
When can we expect you?
When will you get here?
You're still just a kid
Who's Tom climbing with?
This doesn't matter
Tom's beef stew is good
You're all lying
How hot is it outside?
Why did Tom need that?
Did you eat it all?
You've helped us a lot
Tell Tom I'll do anything
Come on, live
We're all looking for Tom
You do things I wouldn't do
Tom, is Mary still with you?
How cold is it outside?
Let's tickle Tom
Did Tom seem calm to you?
Come on, breathe!
Don't do that
Don't die
Can I get a napkin?
Do we need it?
Is it true that Tom was there?
You can't beat us
I didn't hear his steps
Don't expect help from Tom
Go away and leave me alone!
Do they believe us?
I'm in the waiting room
Don't eat the sea urchins
Send me Tom's address
This is Tom's choice
I don't miss Tom at all
We're taxi drivers
Is Tom older than me?
Whose key is that?
I'd like a minute with Tom
I'll come here every year
Did Tom do this alone?
We're biology majors
I think it's time to stop
I'm going to invite Tom
Do you like to read?
I haven't closed the store yet
Are you Scottish?
Who will free me?
I'm tired of eating bananas
Is it up to you?
I'm Hungarian, and you?
He's feeling sick
It stinks!
It smells!
It reeks!
What will you do after work?
That's my house over there
That could've been much worse
That could've gone much worse
I'm stirring my coffee
What terrible weather!
Such terrible weather!
What dreadful weather!
Such dreadful weather!
He's a language purist
Good day to you, sir
I'm a little kid at heart
I'll be sure to call later
You did that on purpose!
Why's Tom at home?
I don't share your beliefs
What does he think?
It's a penalty
We're residents of Boston
We're engaging our engines
Will Tom appear tonight?
Tom doesn't obey orders
Who did Tom call that?
Jürgen Klopp's a soccer genius
I'm not a bandwagoner
I did a few sit-ups
Don't be silly!
Hi to those over there ..
We're creators, not consumers
We'll see who wins
Hi, I'm Tom, and this is Mary
I'm glad nobody died
Don't scare Tom away
So, are you coming?
Tom didn't crash
Why's Tom always absent?
Tom said he saw Mary's dag
Can I pick my nose?
I'll ask Tom about it
Actually, Tom isn't married
We're very good listeners
I'll look for it now
How did Tom even get here?
Maybe we shouldn't do this
I like my in-laws
Don't let them leave
Tom doesn't eat celery
We'll always miss Tom
Who needs you?
I don't know how much I weigh
What rank is Tom?
This isn't our station
Where will Tom stay?
They weren't with me
It's ivory
I won't work for free
I don't want to drink this
What did Tom get wrong?
We won't walk there
Are all of you guys homeless?
I haven't thought about it yet
How old is Tom, anyway?
I'm not giving Tom the apple
It's late, so I should go
It's late, so I should leave
Do you know where Tom sits?
What will Tom do about it?
We're a little disappointed
Whose keys are these?
It's best if you stayed in bed
Isn't Tom the one who fell?
What's a chimney?
Don't worry, he'll get to it
I'll get to it in a moment
I don't know where you are
Don't worry
I'll get that finished today
Don't worry
Don't worry
I'll make breakfast today
Why did Tom fail?
It's very cheap to live here
Why do you want a pet turtle?
Losing weight isn't easy
It isn't easy to lose weight
It's not easy to lose weight
Did Tom have a weapon?
Do you mind?
I can't leave my husband
I got Tom's letter yesterday
Are you going anyway?
I'll buy more beer
I'll try to call Tom again
If they go, I'll go, too
Can Tom really do this?
Bend your elbows at 90 degrees
I'm not a dog lover
“Yogurt” is a Turkish word
I hope Tom didn't tell Mary
Why didn't you vote?
I'm Brazilian
Are you as well?
That isn't Tom's voice
What's that key to?
Where's my eraser?
I'll probably refuse
I'll graduate soon
Maybe I'd better tell Tom
Mary's dress is bright red
Why's it so short?
You'd better ask Tom that
I'm going to come with you
Is Mary really pregnant?
Are you wanted?
I'm not going to beg you
Is that Tom's signature?
Are your classes over yet?
Is this supposed to be fun?
That won't be profitable
It didn't do Tom any good
Tom's belt was unbuckled
Is this your boy?
This isn't useless
What kind of insect is this?
Possibly that's a mistake
I got dirty, too
I've met Tom's parents
I'm going to make sure of that
It's Tom's choice
Who's all this for?
What's a flashlight?
Tom must've taken a taxi
We're on duty
I haven't lost my mind yet
We're speechwriters
Can Tom do it for us?
Shouldn't we follow Tom?
Was Tom ever late?
I'm not expecting guests
Tom didn't lock his door
We're a lot taller than Tom
We can't get near it
Tom won't be able to pass
We shouldn't have left early
Today I didn't win anything
I'm expecting a visit from Tom
Do you come from a big family?
Let's surprise Tom
I made up a folk dance.
I made up a folk dance.
Tom won't forgive himself
What if I disagree?
I'll pay for Tom
I cannot believe it!
Mary's of German descent
It's copyrighted
Don't forget to pay the bill
I wasn't heard
It looks sick, Tom
Is she pregnant?
That's good, though
Is this movie good?
How does this help Tom?
Are you really OK, Tom?
We didn't go
Tom must've taken the bus
Have you emailed Tom yet?
Do you have a minute?
Yes, why?
Maybe we won't go
I'll never say that again
What books have you read?
I'm not allowed to see Tom
I think Tom's gonna pass out
I've tortured the prisoners
Have I been clear enough?
Where can I find Tom now?
What's Tom hiding from us?
It's time to leave, Tom
That goes for Tom, too
That wasn't Tom
When can I meet you?
I don't give Tom any candy
I must've looked stupid
We won't be able to save Tom
Tom doesn't listen to anybody
It'll take one or two days
We're romantics
Staying home isn't an option
Don't be so aggressive
I think that that's not mine
I think that that isn't mine
I think that isn't mine
We're lonely men
When will we have lunch?
I can't deceive Tom
I'm always on duty
My father isn't living anymore
I've been feeling stressed
We'll get through this somehow
What's an auction?
What'll you do after work?
I've almost persuaded Tom
What's this?
It's a peach.
I'll ask Tom to come back
I'm afraid it won't help
What's the point in going now?
I'll let you have this pen
Don't go so fast
We'll talk when you get back
I'm sure you'll like this
I'm sure that you'll like this
I'd rather sit in the back row
I'm as good as you
Why did you do that?
Because I felt like it.
I promise I'll be good
I promise that I'll be good
I promise I'll behave myself
Please don't give up on me
Clean up the mess you've made
It's just us
We're the only ones here
I'm not a scaredy-cat
I'm just careful
This kind of heat isn't normal
This won't happen
I'm a kid at heart
I'm going to meet Tom tonight
I'm totally exhausted
COVID-19 cases are on the rise
How badly do you have to go?
I don't like pepper
Do you like noodles?
I'm a student teacher
Is it valid?
Doesn't it bother Tom?
I'm very ticklish; tickle me!
Seriously, you're unbearable
It's not midnight yet
Well, you've found it
I didn't expect to annoy you
I don't think he's arrived
When have you seen it?
Maybe he's in the bathroom?
Come on, get in the car
Tom and Mary aren't well
I love nature!
I have to go, too
I'm sorry, I overslept
What did Tom promise you?
The weather's really hot today
I'm on my way from the ranch
Where have you been to?
She's amazing
She's astonishing
How can he bear all that?
Who wrote that text?
The people don't know it
They've moved the entrance
I'll go for a walk in a while
Why the delay?
I don't want to work at all!
Is he pregnant?
She doesn't play the piano
I won't go to Los Angeles
I won't move to Los Angeles
I'll make sure it's repaired
Why did you try to get away?
It's best that they resign
Hello, how are you today?
Hi, how are you doing today?
Hi, how are you today?
How are you today?
How are you doing today?
Are you feeling well?
They're friends of ours
Welcome, I am Omid
Did Tom drink anything?
What is it, my dear?
Make up your mind already!
I've tried it several times
Can we trust politicians?
Can we believe politicians?
Do governments lie to us?
Some jobs are face-to-face
It's best to stay home
It's best to stay at home
I don't know if he's sick
I don't know if she's sick
I can't take it anymore!
I'm fed up with you!
It's short
I won't go anywhere
There's no food here
Where are you going so early?
Are they too tight?
That one doesn't suit you
That one doesn't fit you well
I'll cook dinner tonight
I don't like it, I love it
No, not loathe, I abhor it
I think we'll eat fish
It's still leaking
It's also cheaper
Why are your bedsheets wet?
Please don't tell Mom!
It's not normal behavior
Who I am?
Hey, don't you know me?
Don't take things for granted
I didn't bite Tom
I'm tired of ironing
Can you hold it a bit longer?
Is Tom always that quiet?
Tom can run a 5-minute mile
Haha, he cries like a girl!
Do you live under a rock?
It's laminated
I love broth!
Have you seen Tom's art yet?
Tom's dad is also named Tom
That can't be all you've got
You're capable of so much more
I'll find out
Do I really have an accent?
Who will take care of them?
This winter hasn't been cold
This isn't clean
You're crazier than I thought
It's simple; they're idiots
Is this all true?
To meditate..
What's the length?
Tom doesn't know much yet
I didn't have time to swim
We have to go, guys
Everybody's fine
Have you kissed yet?
Tom won't tell anybody
I know what I'm doing, Tom
Tom said he wasn't stupid
This is my mother's
What a curious fact!
Will you come again?
I didn't beat Tom
We won't be on time
I got Tom's phone number
How old is that boy?
Who came with Tom?
I think I'm doing better
We'll help Tom do it
Is that the Big Dipper?
I’m not saying you’re wrong
Tom says he's done it
Is this what you gave Tom?
Is it raining there?
Who's Tom sailing with?
Well, did it help?
I've solved all the problems
It’s the crunchiest part
You're a jerk, Tom
Tom hasn't woken up yet
How's Tom's neck?
Who lives with Tom?
They aren't well
What's Tom doing here?
We didn't invite him
To meditate ..
How much soap do we need?
That's a relief to hear
We've seen Tom recently
Now you're part of my life
Do you want some more of this?
Was it a good party?
Is this really true?
I'm such a dork
I'll try to memorize this poem
I’m on the same boat as you
Is this our train?
Why did you call Tom?
It's our turn soon
I couldn't kill anyone
My phone's charging
We're cartoonists
Did anyone see Tom fall?
Tom should've had a key
Have you two kissed yet?
Does Tom know the truth?
Can this sentence stand alone?
Why did the plane crash?
I'll make it easy for you
Did they feed you?
I should've noticed
Wow!
Tom didn't even thank me
Can Tom do this for us?
Why's it bad?
I'm sorry I couldn't help
Isn't Tom from here?
What do you think?
Is that true?
I'd like that, too
Is Tom one of your brothers?
I'm going to Australia next
I don't know if they heard
Whose dogs are these?
Will Tom come here?
Who told you I'd be here?
Kids shouldn't be in here
Children shouldn't be in here
This isn't your money
It's mine
So, you think this is funny?
Show me what's in your bag
Why's Tom wearing a mask?
I'm not crying
Are memes copyrighted?
You can't handle my power
You call that an ultimatum?
Can I borrow your Switch?
In your dreams.
Is this the real you?
How often do you add audio?
You sleep on that?
You call that a bed?
Do you have any spare clothes?
Don't take it out of context
Who bought Tom his violin?
Finally, we're alone
Why would Tom kiss Mary?
Tom still hasn't got it
It's meaningless
You're wasting your own time
I'd ask Tom to do it
That's all we have
I'm glad that I'm a man
Tom's phone is tapped
How did Tom react to this?
I'm a good citizen
Tom wouldn't calm down
How do I tell Tom this?
That mustn't happen
This box isn't strong enough
There's not much left to say
Does Tom still teach?
You're a very talented writer
She's still nattering on
Excuse me!
Why did Tom do that today?
Is Tom a senior or a junior?
Can I borrow your Switch?
You wish!
Why's that so small?
Maybe I'd better tell Tom now
Are you a freemason?
I'm stuck in an elevator
It is gone!
Don't love everything you see!
Don't say everything you know!
Don't do everything you want!
Is one enough?
Look, there's Tom
I'll try to convince him
It's making me gag
Is there or not?
Is this allowed?
See what's on TV
What does Tom like?
I wasn't understood
Is this your doing?
Who let the ants escape?
They're corrupt
I'm ready to try my luck
Did anyone see Tom do that?
What a fool!
I'm getting a bit chubby again
I'm worried Tom won't come
That's not a sentence
I'm reading a novel
What's theology?
I'll go there again tomorrow
Please don't change
Should we invite Tom?
I'm going to do things my way
This can't be resold
Why don't you eat?
Who organised the party?
Who organised this party?
I'm about to start
Didn't Tom know anything?
Well, I'm not going
Will Tom change his mind?
Are they minors?
Tom doesn't drink hot tea
I see you're dressed up
That's not really true, though
Who else knew?
You'll be stronger together
They will tear you to pieces!
You're alive!
Don't spoil our fun now!
Come to my place!
It's a very important thing
I swear I didn't do that
Who took my briefcase?
Don't whisper
Tom doesn't like to swear
Don't let them get close
Does Tom do it a lot?
He'll play soccer tomorrow
Don't ever come here again!
There's no third chance
We're not compatible
We're incompatible
The temperature's very high
We aren't boys
The fog's very dense
What's happened up ahead?
School starts at eight-thirty
They're already annoyed at me
That's what they get
That's what they deserve
It's hard for me to pronounce
Seafood and I don't get along
He'll write a letter
The cube's frozen
I'm sure they'll come
What's the context?
I don't need any of you
The apple cake's ran out
He'll sleep in prison
Let's ask Alí what he thinks
Think about what you're doing
I still don't know it
Do you?
Who told Tom to buy that?
It's made of a special paste
I'll take what's mine
I'll take what belongs to me
You can't sign with a pencil
War - never again!
And he said, "I don't know
Am I my brother's keeper?
I'll buy something to eat
Was Tom invited?
We're weaklings
Tom won't feel guilty
Have you asked Tom to help us?
Who'll you root for?
I wasn't going to tell Tom
Tom simply can't do that
Did he touch your butt?
Can I touch your cock?
They tasted each other's cum
Tom didn't even make an effort
This is Tom's sketch
This isn't my cup
Now you're wrong
Tom hated his job, so he quit
I'm going to have a test today
Aren't you sorry?
What did Tom buy you?
I've lost my mailbox key
Do you mean Tom is lying?
Are you a newcomer?
I'm going to Boston for a week
We're very old men
I've already ironed my dress
Be careful, please
Tom didn't even call
Do you owe Tom a lot?
Are you a good tennis player?
I didn't doubt you
I'm glad I can't go
I'm glad that I can't go
People don't change
Do you feel the way I feel?
Can you feel the air?
It's invigorating!
This is my little brother, Tom
This is my little sister, Mary
This is Tom, my little brother
Tom's cousin came to visit
Tom's nephew is famous
I'm taking psychology courses

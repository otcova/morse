I'm not a patient person
I'm not a morning person
I'm looking for a friend
I'm late again, aren't I?
I'm just waiting for Tom
I'm just so proud of you
I'm just resting my eyes
I'm just not in the mood
I'm just looking for Tom
I'm just here to observe
I'm just having some fun
I'm just getting started
I'm just being realistic
I'm just a little wheezy
I'm in trouble, aren't I?
I'm in no mood for games
I'm in a really bad mood
I'm home for the weekend
I'm here to buy supplies
I'm here looking for Tom
I'm here for the meeting
I'm headed the other way
I'm headed over to Tom's
I'm going to turn Tom in
I'm going to the station
I'm going to the airport
I'm going to talk to Tom
I'm going to take a look
I'm going to sell my car
I'm going to pick Tom up
I'm going to need a lift
I'm going to need a copy
I'm going to lose my job
I'm going to kill myself
I'm going to ignore that
I'm going to have to run
I'm going to go with Tom
I'm going to go tell Tom
I'm going to go sit down
I'm going to go home now
I'm going to go find Tom
I'm going to go clean up
I'm going to get married
I'm going to get dessert
I'm going to get changed
I'm going to forgive you
I'm going to do it again
I'm going to cook dinner
I'm going to be an uncle
I'm going to be a father
I'm going out of my mind
I'm going out for a walk
I'm going back to school
I'm going back to Boston
I'm glad you're not dead
I'm glad Tom wasn't hurt
I'm glad I got to see it
I'm giving you all I can
I'm getting tired of you
I'm getting sick of this
I'm getting good at this
I'm doing what I have to
I'm doing it voluntarily
I'm delighted to see you
I'm completely blind now
I'm coming to your party
I'm better off in Boston
I'm aware of the problem
I'm asking for your help
I'm as scared as you are
I'm always up this early
I'm almost finished here
I'm allergic to your dog
I'm afraid of losing you
I'm afraid it's not true
I'm a very light sleeper
I'm a little tired today
I'll turn it over to Tom
I'll tell you what to do
I'll tell you what it is
I'll tell you on the way
I'll tell you everything
I'll tell Tom you called
I'll tell Tom when to go
I'll talk with you later
I'll take you up on that
I'll take the next train
I'll take over from here
I'll start getting ready
I'll show you everything
I'll share them with you
I'll send you the recipe
I'll see you to your car
I'll see you guys Monday
I'll see you before I go
I'll see what Tom thinks
I'll see Tom later today
I'll see if Tom is awake
I'll put it on your bill
I'll pay for the damages
I'll need some more time
I'll make up my own mind
I'll make Tom understand
I'll make a note of that
I'll let you get to work
I'll have Tom look at it
I'll have to take a look
I'll have to stay behind
I'll go see if Tom is OK
I'll go get dinner ready
I'll go find another one
I'll go bowling with you
I'll go and look for Tom
I'll go and get you some
I'll go and check on Tom
I'll give you until 2:30
I'll get you some coffee
I'll get you another one
I'll get you another dog
I'll get Tom to help you
I'll get Tom home safely
I'll get started on this
I'll get out of your way
I'll find out eventually
I'll find my own way out
I'll drive Tom to school
I'll do whatever you ask
I'll do better this time
I'll discuss it with Tom
I'll deal with Tom later
I'll call you in an hour
I'll call if we need you
I'll be with him, Doctor
I'll be there in an hour
I'll be sure to tell Tom
I'll be seeing you later
I'll be seeing you again
I'll be right behind you
I'll be over in a minute
I'll be leaving tomorrow
I'll be glad to help you
I'll be fine in a second
I'll be down in a minute
I'll be done in a second
I'll be back in a second
I'll be back by midnight
I'll be back after lunch
I'll be able to show you
I'll be able to help you
I'll be a half hour late
I'll ask Tom to join you
I'll ask Tom if you like
I'll agree to your terms
I'd recommend doing that
I'd really appreciate it
I'd rather you showed me
I'd rather go for a walk
I'd never do that to you
I'd like to speak to you
I'd just like to go home
I'd forgotten about that
I'd appreciate some help
I wouldn't take that bet
I would've let Tom do it
I would've done anything
I won't let you take Tom
I won't let you go there
I won't let Tom go there
I won't answer questions
I wish you'd come inside
I wasn't sure you'd come
I wasn't prepared for it
I wasn't looking for Tom
I wasn't laughing at you
I wasn't honest with Tom
I took Tom's temperature
I told you it wasn't Tom
I thought it'd be easier
I don't want you to stay
I can't swim any further
How are Tom and the kids?
Do you know where we are?
Do you have a suggestion?
Could I look at that one?
Can I borrow your pencil?
Are you paying attention?
Are you in love with Tom?
Answer the question, Tom
You've worked very hard
You've taken a big risk
You've outdone yourself
You've got to let me go
You've got five minutes
You've always helped me
You're wrong about this
You're working too hard
You're the problem, Tom
You're right, of course
You're right, as always
You're out of luck, Tom
You're out of line, Tom
You're on your own, Tom
You're not my assistant
You're not helping, Tom
You're not good at this
You're not easy to find
You're my new assistant
You're my kid's teacher
You're losing your hair
You're having a bad day
You're definitely crazy
You're a beautiful girl
You'll be late for work
You'd regret doing that
You wouldn't believe me
You wouldn't believe it
You won't have a chance
You don't know anything
You can't make us leave
Would you pass the peas?
Why doesn't Tom like me?
Why did Tom lie to Mary?
Who told you to do that?
Who told you about that?
Where are the prisoners?
What's your wife's name?
What's Tom's blood type?
What was Tom's reaction?
What time's the meeting?
Were the windows closed?
We're your friends, Tom
We're worried about you
We're working on it now
We're not going, are we?
We're having fun, right?
Tom's not very handsome
Tom's not in any danger
Tom's blinds are closed
Tom's a bit freaked out
Tom wouldn't talk to me
Tom wouldn't hurt a fly
Tom wouldn't be pleased
Tom would've given up
Tom won't stop drinking
Tom wasn't expecting me
Tom wasn't enthusiastic
Tom said he didn't know
Tom kissed Mary's cheek
Tom isn't wearing socks
Tom isn't wearing a tie
Tom isn't in any danger
Tom is in Mary's office
Tom is about Mary's age
Tom didn't want to wait
Tom couldn't believe it
This is silly, isn't it?
They've brainwashed you
They're very, very good
They're not the problem
They're all watching us
They're all watching TV
They're a brass quintet
They'll know what to do
They'll be watching you
They'll be here tonight
They wouldn't follow us
The TV isn't plugged in
That's ironic, isn't it?
That wasn't the problem
That was you, wasn't it?
That was wonderful, Tom
That was Tom, wasn't it?
That was fun, wasn't it?
It's shocking, isn't it?
It's pathetic, isn't it?
It was an accident, Tom
Is that difficult to do?
I've tried that already
I've trained for months
I'm willing to try that
I'm willing to help you
I'm used to being tired
I'm unprepared for this
I'm trying to read here
I'm trying to avoid Tom
I'm trying to apologize
I'm tougher than I look
I'm too scared to think
I'm tired of this place
I'm tired of pretending
I'm taking them with me
I'm taking it seriously
I'm sure you're correct
I'm sure you'll succeed
I'm sure you'll recover
I'm sure you'll do well
I'm sure you'll do fine
I'm sure you'll be fine
I'm sure you understand
I'm sure you meant that
I'm sure Tom will be OK
I'm sure Tom will agree
I'm sure Tom was sleepy
I'm sure Tom means well
I'm sure it wasn't easy
I'm sure I can help you
I'm sure I can find Tom
I'm supposed to do that
I'm such a blabbermouth
I'm still the boss here
I'm still not ready yet
I'm still not buying it
I'm still kind of tired
I'm standing right here
I'm sorry, I can't help
I'm sorry you got fired
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry I was so mean
I'm sorry I lied to you
I'm sorry I doubted you
I'm sorry for your loss
I'm sorry for the delay
I'm so glad you've come
I'm so glad you're here
I'm so glad you like it
I'm sitting next to Tom
I'm simply doing my job
I'm seeing a trend here
I'm saying I'm not sure
I'm running out of time
I'm returning your call
I'm resigning on Monday
I'm quite aware of that
I'm proud of all of you
I'm pretty good at math
I'm pleased you're here
I'm pleased you like it
I'm perfectly all right
I'm on my way to Boston
I'm on my way there now
I'm on my way back home
I'm on a tight schedule
I'm offering you a deal
I'm nowhere near thirty
I'm not your enemy, Tom
I'm not working tonight
I'm not wasting my time
I'm not to be disturbed
I'm not swallowing that
I'm not sure where I am
I'm not sure about that
I'm not suggesting that
I'm not so sure of that
I'm not so good at this
I'm not really that old
I'm not quite ready yet
I'm not quite done here
I'm not paying for this
I'm not in a party mood
I'm not hiding anything
I'm not good with names
I'm not going to get up
I'm not going to eat it
I'm not getting married
I'm not forgetting that
I'm not feeling so good
I'm not completely sure
I'm not coming with you
I'm not coming in today
I'm not coming home yet
I'm not buying anything
I'm not asking for much
I'm not all that hungry
I'm no longer depressed
I'm making some changes
I'm looking out for you
I'm looking out for Tom
I'm looking for answers
I'm just planning ahead
I'm just obeying orders
I'm just not interested
I'm just glad Tom is OK
I'm just glad it's over
I'm just about finished
I'm just a little woozy
I'm just a little tired
I'm in town on business
I'm in a bit of trouble
I'm honored to know you
I'm here with my family
I'm here to support Tom
I'm here to pick up Tom
I'm here to pick Tom up
I'm here if you need me
I'm here because of Tom
I'm having a rough week
I'm having a lot of fun
I'm having a great time
I'm going to the office
I'm going to take a cab
I'm going to sleep here
I'm going to report you
I'm going to need a wig
I'm going to go see Tom
I'm going to go get Tom
I'm going to go do that
I'm going to get my gun
I'm going to follow Tom
I'm going to do my best
I'm going straight home
I'm going out with Mary
I'm glad you're staying
I'm glad you're pleased
I'm glad you were there
I'm glad you were right
I'm glad you understand
I'm glad you stopped by
I'm glad you moved back
I'm glad you dropped by
I'm glad you asked that
I'm glad Tom enjoyed it
I'm glad that's settled
I'm glad I've found you
I'm glad I ran into you
I'm giving you a choice
I'm giving you a chance
I'm getting tired of it
I'm getting out of town
I'm getting out of here
I'm furious at you, Tom
I'm fully aware of that
I'm from the government
I'm feeling lucky today
I'm driving myself home
I'm concerned about you
I'm coming for you, Tom
I'm coming back tonight
I'm coming back for you
I'm being held prisoner
I'm at the hospital now
I'm at the Hilton Hotel
I'm allergic to peanuts
I'm allergic to carrots
I'm afraid you're wrong
I'm afraid you're right
I'm afraid to interrupt
I'll wait right outside
I'll tell Tom you asked
I'll tell Tom the truth
I'll tell Tom right now
I'll take Tom to dinner
I'll take Tom some food
I'll take care of those
I'll take care of these
I'll take a look around
I'll stay and watch Tom
I'll set it up with Tom
I'll see you guys later
I'll see you again soon
I'll see you after work
I'll put it on your tab
I'll put it on the list
I'll only slow you down
I'll never work for you
I'll never work for Tom
I'll need some supplies
I'll need a few minutes
I'll meet you out front
I'll meet Tom in Boston
I'll make a reservation
I'll let everybody know
I'll keep an eye on Tom
I'll join you all later
I'll help any way I can
I'll have to ask around
I'll handle things here
I'll guard the prisoner
I'll go tell the others
I'll go talk to Tom now
I'll go home and get it
I'll go back and get it
I'll go and talk to Tom
I'll go along with that
I'll give you a new one
I'll get you some water
I'll get us some drinks
I'll get us some coffee
I'll get Tom right away
I'll get the hang of it
I'll get dinner started
I'll fix us some coffee
I'll find out who he is
I'll draw a map for you
I'll do it if I have to
I'll do better tomorrow
I'll do all the talking
I'll deal with it later
I'll come see you later
I'll come back tomorrow
I'll catch the next bus
I'll buy the next round
I'll be waiting outside
I'll be sure to do that
I'll be out in a second
I'll be out in a moment
I'll be out in a minute
I'll be leaving shortly
I'll be in the basement
I'll be glad to do that
I'll be counting on you
I'll be better tomorrow
I'll be back in a month
I'll be at the hospital
I'll ask Tom to help me
I'll ask for directions
I'd say that's accurate
I'd really like to know
I'd really like to help
I'd rather take the bus
I'd rather not touch it
I'd rather do it myself
I'd love a slice of pie
I'd like nothing better
I'd known Tom for years
I'd heard you'd changed
I'd have waited for you
I'd have figured it out
I'd follow Tom anywhere
I'd do anything for Tom
I'd be crazy to do that
I wouldn't recommend it
I wouldn't be surprised
I won't need it anymore
I won't let you do that
I wish you'd been there
I wish it wasn't so hot
I wish I'd known sooner
I wasn't planning on it
I wasn't here last year
I wasn't doing anything
I was up all night, too
I was hoping you'd know
I trust Tom's instincts
I told you I'd help you
I thought you said 2:30
I don't think Tom cares
I can't stay home today
I can't do it by myself
Hey, where're you going?
Do you know what we did?
Are you sure that's all?
Are you here to help me?
You've run out of time
You've been very quiet
You've been good to us
You're wrong, you know
You're wrong, as usual
You're wrong about Tom
You're worse than I am
You're welcome to stay
You're very persuasive
You're not bad looking
You're not bad at this
You're good at drawing
You're a good waitress
You're a good listener
You're a good kid, Tom
You're a good boy, Tom
You're a celebrity now
You're a big help, Tom
You're a bad influence
You'll have no problem
You'll catch pneumonia
You would've liked Tom
You weren't that great
You have to be kidding!
Would you stop, please?
Will you give me a job?
Why should I get a dog?
Why don't you watch TV?
Why are you dressed up?
Who wrote this article?
Who are the kidnappers?
Where did you leave it?
Where are Tom and Mary?
Where are the diamonds?
What's your dog's name?
What's behind the door?
What was the diagnosis?
We're watching a movie
We're out of here, Tom
We're on our honeymoon
We're not your enemies
We're not finished yet
We're not all teachers
We're in this together
We're here for the day
We're all very excited
We're all out of booze
We're all having lunch
We're a very good team
We'll be there at 2:30
We'll be here all week
We won't be doing that
We have a problem, Tom
We don't need a ladder
We don't have a garden
Tom's keys are missing
Tom's hands were dirty
Tom's a teacher, right?
Tom yanked Mary's hair
Tom wouldn't lie to me
Tom wouldn't let us in
Tom wouldn't let me go
Tom wouldn't hurt Mary
Tom wouldn't have lied
Tom won't ask for help
Tom wasn't even scared
Tom isn't always wrong
Tom isn't always right
Tom is my sister's boy
Tom doesn't sleep much
Tom didn't know anyone
This is Tom's computer
This is non-negotiable
This is nice, isn't it?
This is mine, isn't it?
They're out of options
They're not my friends
They're not my enemies
They're all against me
They're about to start
They weren't much help
That wasn't the reason
That isn't true, is it?
Life is good, isn't it?
It's strange, isn't it?
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's an emergency, Tom
It was dark, wasn't it?
Is there anything else?
I'm your new assistant
I'm well aware of that
I'm watching my weight
I'm waiting for a call
I'm very happy for Tom
I'm using common sense
I'm trying to stop Tom
I'm trying to save you
I'm trying to save Tom
I'm trying to practice
I'm trying to meditate
I'm trying to help Tom
I'm trying to help now
I'm trying to find Tom
I'm too tired to argue
I'm there all the time
I'm the one who's sick
I'm the one who did it
I'm the boss, aren't I?
I'm taking you with me
I'm taking you dancing
I'm taking Tom with me
I'm taking this to Tom
I'm taking the day off
I'm sure you mean that
I'm sure you knew that
I'm sure you can do it
I'm sure you are wrong
I'm sure Tom was happy
I'm sure Tom was awake
I'm sure Tom loves you
I'm sure Tom knew that
I'm sure they're wrong
I'm sure they're right
I'm sure it's personal
I'm sure it'll be fine
I'm sure I can find it
I'm studying very hard
I'm still training Tom
I'm still on the clock
I'm staying right here
I'm sort of in a hurry
I'm sorry, I really am
I'm sorry I have to go
I'm sorry I even tried
I'm sorry for the mess
I'm sitting right here
I'm sick of being hurt
I'm serious about this
I'm seeing a therapist
I'm really proud of it
I'm ready for tomorrow
I'm parked around back
I'm one of the dancers
I'm offering you a job
I'm offering Tom a job
I'm off to pick up Tom
I'm occupied right now
I'm not upset with you
I'm not talking to you
I'm not taking the job
I'm not taking the bus
I'm not sure who he is
I'm not sure it's real
I'm not sorry I'm late
I'm not ready for this
I'm not quite sure yet
I'm not playing a game
I'm not nervous at all
I'm not messing around
I'm not making this up
I'm not making excuses
I'm not letting you go
I'm not letting Tom in
I'm not letting Tom go
I'm not kidding around
I'm not in any trouble
I'm not hungry anymore
I'm not here every day
I'm not having any fun
I'm not going to Tom's
I'm not going to do it
I'm not going anyplace
I'm not giving this up
I'm not doing it again
I'm not doing anything
I'm not disputing that
I'm not counting on it
I'm not answering that
I'm not angry with you
I'm not all that smart
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm no good at dancing
I'm mad at both of you
I'm lucky to have this
I'm losing my patience
I'm looking for my hat
I'm leaving for Boston
I'm just the messenger
I'm just stating facts
I'm interested in this
I'm in shock right now
I'm in law enforcement
I'm in constant danger
I'm impressed with you
I'm horrible with kids
I'm hoping to find Tom
I'm honored to be here
I'm here with a friend
I'm here to rescue Tom
I'm here to get my dog
I'm here to assist you
I'm here about the job
I'm having a rough day
I'm having a nice time
I'm having a good time
I'm good with children
I'm going to visit Tom
I'm going to Tom's house
I'm going to take this
I'm going to stop them
I'm going to stay here
I'm going to need help
I'm going to my office
I'm going to miss that
I'm going to leave now
I'm going to head home
I'm going to go to bed
I'm going to go change
I'm going to get ready
I'm going to get fired
I'm going to come back
I'm going back to work
I'm going back for Tom
I'm glad you were here
I'm glad you showed up
I'm glad you said that
I'm glad you got a dog
I'm glad Tom came back
I'm glad that you came
I'm glad it's all over
I'm glad it worked out
I'm glad I invited you
I'm getting rid of Tom
I'm getting on the bus
I'm getting good at it
I'm full of good ideas
I'm filling in for Tom
I'm feeling very shaky
I'm excited about this
I'm done with all that
I'm doing this for Tom
I'm coming to save you
I'm coming to help you
I'm being quite honest
I'm being looked after
I'm being held hostage
I'm aware of the risks
I'm aware of the facts
I'm at Tom's apartment
I'm asking you to stay
I'm afraid Tom is dead
I'm afraid of drowning
I'm a little congested
I'll wait here for you
I'll wait for you here
I'll try anything once
I'll tell Tom tomorrow
I'll talk to you later
I'll talk to Tom later
I'll take what you got
I'll take Tom home now
I'll take it from here
I'll take care of this
I'll take a look at it
I'll shoot both of you
I'll send you the link
I'll send you the bill
I'll see you very soon
I'll see you two later
I'll see you soon, Tom
I'll see you on Monday
I'll see you later, OK?
I'll see you in Boston
I'll return in a jiffy
I'll put on some music
I'll prepare something
I'll prepare some food
I'll pick Tom up later
I'll pay for it myself
I'll never tell anyone
I'll never forget this
I'll never forget that
I'll never be like Tom
I'll need my own tools
I'll need a few things
I'll meet Tom tomorrow
I'll make something up
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to Tom
I'll keep you informed
I'll keep that in mind
I'll just wait outside
I'll honor your wishes
I'll hide it somewhere
I'll help you clean up
I'll have to call back
I'll have another beer
I'll handle that later
I'll go when I'm ready
I'll go tell everybody
I'll go if you make me
I'll go get cleaned up
I'll go back to Boston
I'll go along with you
I'll get you some wine
I'll get you back home
I'll get Tom to listen
I'll get Tom a present
I'll get right on that
I'll get a hold of you
I'll find someone else
I'll find out tomorrow
I'll do that right now
I'll do so immediately
I'll do more than that
I'll do as you request
I'll deliver it myself
I'll decide that later
I'll catch up with you
I'll call you tomorrow
I'll call Tom tomorrow
I'll call an ambulance
I'll be your chaperone
I'll be your bodyguard
I'll be up on the roof
I'll be there in a sec
I'll be taking the car
I'll be right upstairs
I'll be right out here
I'll be right in there
I'll be out in a while
I'll be in the library
I'll be in the kitchen
I'll be in my quarters
I'll be fine on my own
I'll be around all day
I'll ask you once more
I'll arrange a meeting
I'll admit I'm worried
I'd say you're jealous
I'd say Tom is jealous
I'd say the same thing
I'd rather be with you
I'd never suggest that
I'd never ever do that
I'd have told you that
I'd forgotten about it
I'd do almost anything
I'd better talk to Tom
I'd better say goodbye
I'd better return this
I'd better go find Tom
I'd better get started
I'd be willing to help
I'd be really grateful
I wouldn't think of it
I wouldn't repeat that
I wouldn't go in there
I wouldn't bet on that
I wouldn't advise that
I won't tamper with it
I won't live like that
I won't fail this time
I won't change my mind
I won't be intimidated
I won't be blackmailed
I wish you wouldn't go
I wish you hadn't come
I went into Tom's room
I wasn't aware of that
I was Tom's apprentice
I was hoping you'd ask
I told you I'd be back
I thought we said 2:30
I hope Tom doesn't die
I assume it's not good
Hold the elevator, Tom
Do you want my opinion?
Do you want in on this?
Do you need more money?
Do you know what to do?
Do you have any doubts?
Do you feel better now?
Are you ready for this?
You've wasted my time
You've lost your mind
You've got to wake up
You've got to go back
You've done your best
You're worse than Tom
You're very kind, Tom
You're out of uniform
You're out of control
You're on my property
You're not very funny
You're not my brother
You're my kind of gal
You're good with kids
You're bleeding again
You're all against me
You're a little early
You're a great kisser
You're a good teacher
You're a good student
You're a good soldier
You're a good partner
You're a brave person
You'll have your turn
You'll have no choice
You'll be on your own
You wouldn't like Tom
You wouldn't enjoy it
You would've liked it
You weren't very nice
You weren't here then
You weren't gone long
Would you like a bath?
Will we be there soon?
Why is the plane late?
Why can't you help me?
Where are the cookies?
What're your thoughts?
What was Tom's answer?
What was the question?
What is the diagnosis?
We're late for school
We're checking it out
We're checking it now
We're a little behind
We'll be watching you
We'll be here all day
We wish you well, Tom
We have a deal, right?
Tom's wrong, you know
Tom's very, very good
Tom's not in his room
Tom's not at all sure
Tom isn't a very good cook
Tom's not a good liar
Tom's good at his job
Tom's dog barks a lot
Tom's bags are packed
Tom, are you in there?
Tom won't talk to you
Tom waited until 2:30
Tom isn't cooperating
Tom isn't a candidate
Tom isn't a bad coach

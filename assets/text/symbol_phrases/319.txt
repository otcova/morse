Did you fly to the baker's?
That's a day I won't forget
That's my favourite number
It's my favourite number
So, tell me about the party
Next slide, please
I'm tired of making ends meet
So, go untie that, you!
The programme's started
I wish I hadn't seen it now
I wish I hadn't seen that now
I'll have three of everything
Today was the big day!
I've left my brolly on a bus
I don't have a valid excuse
Come on, look me in the eye
Let's take a look, then
Actually, it's a fly agaric
Actually, we're not brothers
Actually, he's right
That battalion over there?
It's just cannon fodder
I swear I'll rip off your head
Later, he also learned Polish
She'll like this!
She's well known
Under where?
Don't finish your thought
Try it out!
He's got a nice ass
Tom, don't drink that!
It's a Molotov cocktail!
How were they formed?
Quite a show, huh?
Whip it out!
It's a bottle of water
Great!
He's got some nerve
I'm alone in the city
She just can't get used to it
Tom is at Mary's side
Get out of here, you jerk!
What'd be of us without love?
When's the test?
I don't know
Ask your sister.
I'd love to know to fly
Did you bring more with you?
Don't worry, I'll manage
I don't know him well yet
Please don't insist
He's an amazing person
I'm so sad I'm crying
You're unique and unrepeatable
The code can't be cracked
What's the temperature there?
I don't like people who swear
I do it, too
They're talking to each other
They're very important people
I'm living the good life
I won't be home tomorrow night
I wasn't home last night
Go and screw yourself!
Fuck yourself!
Give it a rest!
Buzz off!
It's a scream!
I haven't got a clue!
No sex please, we're British!
I'm poorly
It's pelting down
It's chucking down
It's coming down in buckets
He's basically a bad person
It's a scorcher!
It's parky
I'm bloody freezing
I'm perishing
It's brass monkey weather
Bloody hell fire!
Fucking hell fire!
Flaming heck!
Bugger!
For fucks sake!
Flaming hell!
I'm drained
He's a chronic latecomer
I'm tired out
I'm fucked
Get a room!
He’s got me in his pocket
How many months is a year old?
I'll do it in the afternoon
I didn't see you yesterday
She's smothering me with love
Hello, Tom!
Cathy's in a funny mood today
I'm penniless
What colour are your pyjamas?
Do you have walking boots?
Have you got walking boots?
Did I get this right?
Does she play the guitar?
What did she ask you for?
Why did you do that, Tom?
Is it worth the effort?
That's got to hurt
There's thunder, but no rain
I'm sure he didn't say that
He surely didn't say that
I'd rather you stayed here
It’s understood either way
Has your room got two windows?
She might've missed the train
I'm moving out next month
Promise you won't forget me
Tired, he went to bed
Are you staying at home?
Here's a clue
She's running riot!
A gift for him, from her
That's pain medicine
Why not have a go?
That's all too crazy!
What else could they be?
The next day, I saw the girl
How are you going to do this?
Can you help me get this done?
Can you reblog this?
Can you retweet this?
I'll try to do that next
Tripe!
Baloney!
Are you pissed off?
It doesn't seem polite to me
Can I rent it to you?
I'm so going to destroy you!
It's legit not funny
Look at how he nutmegged him..
How beautiful is that!
What did you cook?
What have you cooked?
I'd give my life for him
Sorry, my mind isn't all here
I'm an incurable romantic
I'm the executor of her estate
It's a bunch of tripe
He's a big hulk of a man
I'll do it..
He's just picking a fight
You're moving on
You're awfully thin
Can't you even do this?
You're a tempting devil
I'm tired of your lies
Do you like black cock?
How long will the flight last?
I can't communicate in French
Your house isn't far from here
Her house isn't far from here
His firm opened in 2005
I don't like singing in public
If only you'd phoned me!
If only you'd rung me!
Mum, mum!
Tom tripped me!
That yob!
I'll give him what for!
What's up?
Why are you sad?
What's wrong?
Why are you sad?
What's wrong?
What's happened?
Are you coming shopping?
That's lovely!
Where did you get it?
Move along!
Nothing to see here!
Tom hasn't got a television
Tom, I'm going shopping
I used to weigh 11 stone
Do you wear jewellery?
Of course!
Fill your boots!
He doesn't want to be a cowboy
It's a very busy street
Someone robbed me!
It's to the left
It's to the right
How can I call you?
Please, help me!
How does the food taste?
Where can I buy a bus ticket?
Where can I buy bus tickets?
Where can I buy train tickets?
Could you tell me your name?
How much for one piece?
How much do they cost apiece?
Can you give me one of these?
Is it actually true?
Are you a hylozoist?
Do you believe in hylozoism?
She's naked
I'm glad I live in my country
I'm feeling a bit peckish
Give me the bread!
This dog is lying!
Open this damn door!
She's not getting better
What a ripoff!
She's possessed by the devil
We didn't want to go to Greece
Mary didn't like me
I've got nothing to regret
I've left the key in the flat
He's doing well at school
You've bought new loudspeakers
That's incomprehensible
He's afraid of everything
The outboard motor won't start
Is there a garage near here?
It's all just humbug
It's damaged his reputation
What motivated them?
Were you previously in India?
We don't talk about Tom
We didn't talk about Tom
You're going to be executed
I've never tried it before
That's the perfect job for you
I know you're awake
He can't hear out of one ear
What party is in power?
Do you want to negotiate?
Now that'll be interesting
She's on birth control pills
What silly questions!
How unpredictable life is!
Slowly blink back at them!
I can't get sex out of my head
He's been struck by a stroke
Was Tom at work today?
Hey, that's my seat
So why not go out with me?
Do you want to go out with me?
You never used to say that.
He’s a great-looking guy
He's not bad at all
Why did she ask you?
I don't care about his past
Did you know that?
This is a storm in a tea-cup
What a stupid son of a bitch!
I'm sure she doesn't want to
Let's exchange phone numbers
It's not important
He's not petty at all
That shouldn't have to be said
When is half-term?
I'm sure I'm his only woman
It's an unprecedented case
How big is the problem?
I'm always browsing a device
Do you really want Tom to die?
Is toothpaste your favorite?
Don't hate the player
Oh shit, it's already late!
I'm learning Lakota
I'm smitten with him
They're so beautiful
When does bus number 6 leave?
How did you screw this up?
He's always so nice to me
How can I get to platform 4?
Where can I find platform 4?
What happened to your dress?
Excuse me, is that your dog?
Yes, that's my dog, why?
Give me it!
Do you have walking shoes?
Have you got walking shoes?
Is that right?
I'm sorry to hear that
Is that so?
I'm sorry to hear that
What time do you get up?
Eight.
Don't wolf your food down
He's bi and large
She's bi and large
When does the last bus leave?
May I see a menu?
Could I get a menu?
Is Batman gay?
Do you say that here?
I'm ready to pay now
Could I have my bill?
What time does the zoo close?
Can I have my bill?
Can I have my check?
Where's the dressing room?
Do you sell apples here?
Do you sell coffee here?
Do you sell ice cream here?
Where can I find sugar?
Do you sell imported beer?
Are you here with your family?
Where is the nearest hospital?
Will you be checking any bags?
Are you checking any bags?
You're so plain, you know?
Do you have any vegan dishes?
Could I get a map?
After all that, we lost, huh?
Can I see your ticket, please?
How long is this ticket valid?
Hah!
No way in hell I'd fund that!
What are today's specials?
Does that come with fries?
Can I get some extra ketchup?
Do you have a service charge?
Is there a service charge?
What's the service charge?
Are you ready to order yet?
When does the museum open?
When does the art museum open?
How much is admission?
Do you have any free maps?
How many tickets do you need?
How many tickets do you want?
This stuff tastes gross!
I love no one, not even you
When do you open?
Where is the taxi stand?
Where can I get some ice?
I'll never understand it
I'll take your entire stock
She doesn't wear dentures
To the airport, please
Do you take cash?
How lucky can one guy get?
I couldn't find my seat number
He's not at home now
When will the next bus come?
You're so pathetic!
What do you like to be called?
What do you go by?
Where's the fitting room?
How old is our planet?
Tom couldn't kill anybody
He doesn't know how to walk
Maybe I'm a good person
Maybe I'm a friend
You don't want to sleep
You're not tired
Stay well!
Where is the moon?
What is Thomas working on now?
How long did you sleep for?
Is the fruit yellow or green?
What should I tell my mom?
You're breaking my balls
When is the meal being served?
Mary, phone for you.
Let me guess: Tom?
You're worthy of love
There's no one I can count on
I've just arrived from the UK
That's irrelevant.
How far do you trust Tom?
Press the button, please
I haven't got any cash
Can I write a cheque?
I'd like to cash a cheque
I hoped I'd see her there
I hoped I'd meet her there
You've always got an excuse
I wish I wasn't so stupid
Tom speaks excellent French!
No wonder!
His mother is French.
I won't even wait a minute
The train won't wait
That's typical female logic
Was that true?
We can't have two beds
That's a little presumptuous
You shouldn't do that.
I have to do this.
Hi.
Hi.
But, speaking is another thing
Do we need Tom's permission?
Which party is in power?
Which party is in power?
What party is in power?
Do you have a favorite number?
I'll be moving out next month
I'd like to cash a check
Where is the swimming pool?
Where is the pool?
I'd like to forget you
Where were you?
Do you see anyone?
Can you see anybody?
Can we have the menu, please?
You are improving!
I've lost my asthma inhaler
Can everyone hear me okay?
How can I redeem myself?
How can I atone for my guilt?
Tom, it's two in the morning
Just let me sleep.
He's a little uptight
He's a little stiff
Do you want to jog with me?
Can I jog with you?
You're a little distracted
You shouldn't spy on Tom
The oven's on
The logograms were old-style
Sew it up, then!
This cake of yours is moreish!
I try my best.
He's not a talkative person
It would've been nice
He's feeling generous today
They're doing very badly
I'll have three of each
It's gone now
Why were you so angry?
I promise I'll think about it
When's the lunch break?
Hey, this is my seat
Is that true?
Is that actually true?
I'll try doing that next
Let's cancel our picnic
It's too cold today
May I open the curtains?
The breakfast is cold!
Are humans like chickens?
They said it's incurable
This isn't the wrench I want
I'm called Farshad
Welcome to the club, Tom
Get that mongrel away from me!
Her name is Cookie.
It was pandemonium!
You don't understand!
Go ahead, make my day
It's going to be a bumpy night
They call me Mister Tibbs!
Made if, Ma!
Top of the world!
I am big!
She's cagey about her plans
Why did you refuse my offer?
She doesn't want to buy wine
You broke Mom's favorite vase
That fish must've gone bad
I think I'm going to throw up
Don't keep trusting him
She's tired of being a loser
Tom's condition isn't good
Don't talk, Tom
Don't hug me
I'm very angry about that
I think I'm falling for Tom
Tom is a non-believer
I'm one of the teachers here
Mary's eyes are beautiful
Tom doesn't ski
Tom doesn't skate
Tom's boss gave him a raise
Dr. Jackson is a psychologist
Who's Tom's mentor?
I read Tom's article
I read Tom's essay
I read Tom's book
Tom's spelling is bad
Tom isn't a very good speller
If you want to leave, you can
There's a bus there
Where is cocoa cultivated?
I won't beg Tom for anything
I’m worried about the virus
She's experiencing pressure
I'll never make it without you
Please, let’s not argue again
Let's leave it at that
Maybe I'm just too selfish
We're moving to town tomorrow
You've found us
Could I have some of that?
When are you open till today?
When are you open until today?
Have we reached the nadir yet?
Have you got the report yet?
Do you have the report yet?
What time do the shops shut?
When do the shops close?
When do the shops shut?
When does the café close?
When does the cafe close?
What time does the café close?
What time does the cafe close?
When does the market shut?
When does the library close?
What time does the pub close?
What time does the pub shut?
When does the pub shut?
When do the pubs shut here?
When do the pubs close here?
Tom won't drink instant coffee
I thought you were gay.
I'm bi.
I don't believe what I heard
Tomorrow's Tom's wedding day
Shhh!
Tomorrow's Tom's birthday
I know we're going to break up
I know we're through
So, you're back again
Who'll try the case?
Pluto isn't a planet anymore
Hello!
Hello, how are you?
Hello!
Hi, how are you?
Without you, I have no fun
He's a concrete person
Reality isn't as you depict it
It's going to be a long night
Today, I'm very tired
I can't possibly know him
Tom doesn't have any food
Who's going to pay this bill?
Do you have a drink?
You're like a big woman
You're an emotional dalit!
An emotional what?
What's Tom's position?
I said that to Tom's face
Where does Tom hang out?
I'd like to know her name
I'd like to know their names
I don't know any of those men
She's very thrifty
There's a bus over there
You write like a commoner!
I'm not the one who helped Tom
I'm not the one who met Tom
Excuse me, Tom, do you mind?
He's only thirty-one!
Give over, Tom!
He's only thirty-one!
Hurry up!
I can't wait any longer
Is the teacher young?
He's away at the moment
He's out at the moment
I'm like a Vorlon
I know you're a Sinophobe
You're a special person
She can't possibly know him
It's him she loves
He's going to be somebody
It's going to cool down
I'm not ready to have a child
May I borrow your hair dryer?
Leave nothing but footprints.
You give me a kiss?
Can you give me a kiss?
Will you give me a kiss?
Can you kiss me?
Do you have any band-aids?
He's in his underwear
Which way is the canteen?
Is the canteen open yet?
What a gorgeous sunset!
I'm a pupil
I'm a school pupil
I'm at university
I'm on the way to hospital
I'm on my way to hospital
It starts at 6.30
I've got three tickets
Are you out of bed?
We've moved
Can I check in?
We're taking part
That's your pudding
He's learning to drive
I'm shivering with cold
I've had a bath
Do you want apples or peaches?
Tom didn't pass the exam.
He hardly did any studying.
If only you'd be a bit quieter
He almost didn't recognize me
She's deaf
Why did he steal her money?
It was a tone-deaf remark
I'm sorry, I can't do that now
I'm not insulting you
Who'll hear the case?
Tom's voice carries well
This hotel won't do
Who'll try this case?
I can't possibly know her
We don't have much left to do
There's not much left to do
Was it rainy in Boston?
Our company doesn't pay well
Tom can't possibly know Mary
You don't understand!
He's made deplorable gestures
Where'd you put the champagne?
Do you like those mountains?
I think they're wonderful.
You've got some left
Don't waste time!
John didn't want to come back
She's been very lucky
He's gained a lot of weight
It won't do itself
Get off his back!
I'm kindness personified
He can't digest milk
You're really tall
Where might I find it?
Where might I find him?
He's keeping his head up
They changed Tom's mind
Mary's fallen ill
Don't talk so loudly!
Is it a little windy?
No, I forgot it at home
It's already been thirty years
Are you from Ecuador?
It was her fault, too
What is it?
I'd better not tell you.
Today's Yumi's birthday
Oh, you're gay?
Do you know Tom Jackson?
But yes.
We're for justice
We're pro-justice
I need to ask you a favor.
What is it?
I'm enjoying the sunshine
Wow!
You speak my language!
This is man-made
It helps me eat less.
So, what're you trying to say?
That's not a legitimate excuse
I'm afraid to go in there
I expected you at 2:30
I'll phone you at 2:30
I'll call you at 2:30
Tom said he's seen everything
Don't talk so loudly
It's a little windy today
Tom didn't want to come back
I think I could've helped them
Tom isn't busy at the moment
That wasn't very spicy
This isn't very spicy
Tom doesn't usually drink tea
I wish I'd been able to help
We've always treated you well
I'll call you back later today
I've bookmarked that page
I think it's OK to do that
I think it's OK to leave early
If I could do that, I would
If I could help, I would
It's about 2:30, I think
Living here isn't cheap
Can't you just be quiet?
Can't you please be quiet?
I'd like to become a lawyer
Mercy!
He's really pushing it
Are you a top or a bottom?
She couldn't sustain his gaze
Why did you beat him?
She didn’t seem to notice
I'm not a militant atheist
He doesn't want to grow up
Well, my friend, you did it!
What are you looking for here?
What the fuck is fatphobia?
What are you saying to me?
If Tom comes, I will leave
I'm still convinced I'm right
I'm suffering, too
Don't you dare blame me
Now it's my turn
She sat down, sighing
I'm sorry
It's my shout
Don't pull faces
I've had a flu jab
I don't want to go to hospital
How do you know I saw a gnome?
You'll move on
You'll forget me
You'd better take a sick day
Nasty weather, isn't it?
We don't talk about rats
You're not even a friend
Santa Claus doesn't exist
Santa Claus isn't real
I don't believe in Santa
On the contrary!
Group sex!
Orgy!
Stronger!
Harder!
Up!
Snooze!
Who the hell is he?
He's always on the road
Why are you avoiding Tom?
Did you hear something squawk?
It's made of alabaster
Dogs don't like cats
He's staring at the newspaper
Are you really a wizard?
Hey, get a grip!
Guys, stop fighting!
I've come to appreciate her
You really are an idiot!
He was half-drunk
Don't blame me
It wasn't my fault
Don't blame this problem on me
I don't blame Tom for crying
I don't blame you
How are you going to fix this?
Blaming others won't help
Yesterday, Tom made me do that
Is religion just fantasy?
Tom's mother gave Tom a bath
Tom's mother gave him a bath
It's already June..
The boy's nose was bleeding
What do we do once we get in?
Eat the solid part, too
Protect Tom, please
Do you think?
Don't smoke in public places
He's an active boy
He's an active child
Why?
Andrea, what happened?
Why is your foot wrapped up?
I'm fine, I just twisted it
What are you basing this on?
He's ultimately blameless
He's a chickenshit
You don't have to think wrong
I'll shave my armpits for you
I see!
He's as thin as a rail
She's as pretty as a picture
She is figure-conscious
She's got ample frontage
She's a real looker
It's pitch dark
He's at death's door
He's at the point of death
I'm going to spend a penny
He's in a bad way
He won't last the winter out
He's as dead as a doornail
I'm suffering agonies
She's got what it takes
Many thanks!
Thank you very much!
Mr Miller!
Mr Miller!
Yes, what is it, Taylor?
I'm in a hurry.
He said he couldn't afford it.
That bike's full of rust
He said he couldn't afford it.
Are you awake yet?
No, I'm still asleep
Now, get out!
Tom wouldn't have gone there
Well, that's all I know
I've never been to the zoo
I'm anaemic
As I said, no problem
I was sure I'd find you here
What will you do if it's true?
I'll pick you up at three
Shall I stop?
Don't worry
We're now coming
In the end, she didn't come
I'll go and pick him up
Why are you going so slowly?
We don't want Tom here anymore
It's not going to rain today
Why do you talk so quiet?
I can't hear anything
Don't you fear death?
Can you show me the horse?
But it wasn't me
I've several jobs to finish
It's nice to be home again
Were they difficult decisions?
Is it serious, doctor?
It's your turn tonight
You must come quickly!
I've lived in Paris since 1977
May I bring a friend?
It's really a mess forever!
Tom won't live a long life
Tom's life will be short
I'm bored
How many donuts did Tom eat?
You're really pathetic
Oh, you don't believe that!
You're a businessperson
That doesn't always work
He's extremely muscular
We're only casual friends
He’s all I've left
Daddy, welcome back!
Hey, Momoka!
I brought you something.
Thanks, Daddy
That's sweet
It's just the one I wanted
I love you, Daddy.
Don't say that, Yumi
You'll get better
So pull yourself together.
That isn't always successful
I'm sipping good wine
He's coming towards me
I can't hold back a tear
Shouldn't you go away already?
Man, I hate my wife.
Tom's wife?
Please don't bother my son
She's devoted to home life
I didn't feel like doing much
It's a challenge to myself
''Don't talk nonsense, Yumi
You're gonna get better
I'm certain of it
You've gotta be strong.''
I was just curious.
They melt in your mouth!''
You don't have hairy legs
I'll try to do that later
Just stay at home, then.
I can't do that either.
Why not?
Sorry!
I forgot.
Let me through!
I'm a doctor
I set out to be honest, always
Does she speak Spanish?
Does he speak Spanish?
So, what about you?
How's your career going?
Don't die yet
Hmm, okay
I'm asking if you're hungry
It's really big.
Don't do too much
You'll only become dead
Cool!
I wonder what it is.
You look really tired.
I'm not tired.
What time are you free?
Is it me you're talking about?
I didn't feel like swimming
It might've been a mistake
I like to jog, but Tom doesn't
I should've bought a pencil
You should've bought a pencil
Courage, my friend
She's removing her bra
How much is this purse?
This milk is from Ziri's cows
He's a citizen of Azerbaijan
He's of Georgian descent
What's needed?
Could lifeforms be such?
You make me feel alive, wanted
I can't hear you
It's too noisy in here
What'll you do if that's true?
What'll you do if it snows?
Which road will you take?
How do you plan to get there?
I'll tell you about it later
Which flavor do you want?
Which color do you want?
Where are you going to park?
We called it "Beauty Park.
This chair isn't comfortable
A month later, he wanted a kid
Who gave you my number?
Tom.
Why did he give you my number?
He's not stupider than you
Do you ever see Lucy?
What job do you do?
It's relativity
I'm a woman
They don't wanna let me go
I'll bring this
What did they do wrong?
He didn't do anything wrong
How did I do you wrong?
Just don't peek
What is your serial number?
You're a bleached blonde
No bleached hair!
No earrings!
I've missed you so much, honey
You're acting just like Dad
He's very vulnerable right now
I'm not fine
The video isn't available
Enjoy your meal.
Thanks, you too.
When do you come to Brazil?
He looked as if he wasn't busy
Why do we fight so much?
Why?
Ah, yes, it's true
A fiver a doughnut?
You're having a laugh!
I can't tempt you, then?
No, mate, you can't!
It's time we did something
I've been driving since 1996
Read to yourself.
I am reading to myself.
I mean without talking.
Have you got a girlfriend?
I've got a wife.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I have a wife.
It suits me, doesn't it?
If it's bad, change it
I've got to practise my German
The meeting will end at 7
Ah, yeah
That's true
I'm talking to Rocío
Her girlfriend's name is Roxie
His husband's name is Ludwig
One day my prince will come…
Her wife's name is Emilia
So let's dance!
Let's not get rid of it
Let's keep it
It's eleven a.m
I didn't draw it
I'd love to see you dance
I don't resent you
Now what did I do?
When I woke up, Tom was gone
What?
You lied to me?
How could you?
Always right-click NFTs
If Tom comes, I'll leave
Don't you feel hot in here?
Tom hasn't apologized yet
I bought Tom some food, too
Was Tom able to escape?
It's become habit
We regret what we've done
It's a very common expression
Please don't bother Tom
He's studying
I'd like to take a short nap
She's crying for me
It's a dead cinch
Keep your shirt on!
You're going to catch hell

Tom's a glory seeker
Tom's an egotist
The film's starting
Are you hungry?
I'll make you something
Has Tom already finished?
Are there earthquakes on Mars?
I'll tell Tom we're not ready
It could change, of course
What is their goal?
Why didn't you let Tom in?
He's upset the apple cart
She's upset the apple cart
That's something I love to do
I should've known it was Tom
He's known all over town
You'll take your chances
Now let's get down to business
I keep missing Tom's calls
I can't believe what I saw
That's my business!
Why do people need to do this?
I'd hoped to see Tom again
We don't live in Australia now
That's not why we work
You're free to use this car
That's been the plan all along
You'll see that I'm right
I'll tell Tom we're ready
You'll succeed in the end
You're all our guests tonight
You're both pretty and kind
You're as tall as my sister
The ones that love me.
There's a chance Tom was wrong
You're wrong in some respects
They're going to work for her
We're looking for Tom's car
Are those your things?
Open your mouth, please
I don't want to be a nuisance
He's heading to Paris
Why did you do it?
What's wrong?
You should've started by now
You'd better see the doctor
You're always criticizing me
You're not to leave this room
Let's not think about that
You're no longer a child
You're no longer a mere child
You're nothing but a student
This isn't an adventure
It's a suicide mission
Tom hasn't arrived
How's your project going?
Can you stand on your head?
Are you afraid of Tom, too?
Are you also afraid of Tom?
They destroy people's lives
Tom isn't my boyfriend
That shouldn't be a big deal
Maybe that's what we should do
You swore that you'd do it
Tigers don't make good pets
Which tank is leaking?
I'll stay if you want me to
I'll never eat here again
Who should we invite?
That isn't a game for kids
That's not a game for kids
Does everyone have a pencil?
Which faucet is leaking?
You're not hungry
You're just bored
I'm not really into dancing
Don't become another statistic
I'm nearby
Why didn't you invite Tom too?
Tom's car is newer than Mary's
Don't let Tom do this again
Tom's dog ate my sandwich
I'm putting on lipstick
Tom, watch your tone of voice!
It probably won't happen today
Can we have some privacy?
I don't fit in
Don't twist my words!
Oh my God!
Don't twist my words around!
Tom is a weak-willed person
You'll always find me honest
They healed a broken land.”
How many eyes do you have?
How many hands do you have?
There are two.
We didn't want Tom to stay
What was I thinking about?
The concert didn't last long
Did you wash the dishes?
We didn't expect Tom to stay
We don't believe that's true
I'm relearning French
Why are you sitting down?
You're on my radar
I still don't know who to pick
I'll tell Tom we aren't ready
Hopefully, this will help
I'll have to change my plans
You look fantastic.
Thank you.
You look great for... forty?
Actually, I'm fifty-four.
Yanni's wife bled him dry
She wasn't in love with me
Why didn't you close the door?
I'm his wife.
You're his wife?
Of course.
Yanni's business boomed
Could you help me in here?
This man in a monster.
Did you hit Skura?
Yes.
You're on your own.
I'm your brother
You should bail me out.
Never hit a woman.
You'll be sorry for it.
You can't do it on your own
Yanni's death made headlines
Would you excuse me a second?
What's this?
You tell me.
I think it's a body.
Tom's hyperactive
Let's deal with that first
Praise God!
When did you see Yanni last?
Yesterday at the mosque.
I'm sorry for waking you up
You're full of hatred!
We didn't tell Tom to stay
Why's this plan better?
Do you want milk in it?
Do you want bread to it?
It was nice to meet you, sir
She didn't need money
I didn't come here to fight
We need to go.
We who?
Have you seen my blouse?
I can't find it anywhere
Who's this, your bitch?
What are you cooking?
OK.
Please wait outside.
Oh, sorry
Sure.
Who said the N-word?
How about dinner tonight?
I'd love to.
We won't tell Tom about that
Do not steal!
If I were you, I'd help Tom
Please report what's happening
Have you found the murderer?
Who woke Tom up this morning?
We didn't ask Tom to stay
Look, I really need your help
I'll drive in that direction
Of course, we'll blame Tom
I'm going stir-crazy
Did you find the killer?
I'm risking my neck
Did I leave my briefcase here?
He's sharply dressed
No u-turn!
I only know what he's called
Don't monologue!
This doesn't seem right
Thirty minutes.
Only thirty minutes.
Only thirty minutes.
About thirty minutes.
Thirty minutes.
I'm so jealous
Only about thirty minutes.
About thirty minutes.
Only thirty minutes.
How much time do we have left?
Only thirty minutes.
Let's try this one more time
Can't say I didn't warn you
I wonder how long you'll last
Are koalas bears?
Yanni was under Skura's spell
Don't dwell in the past
Don't lose faith
Why don't you invite Tom?
What are you doing for others?
This warm weather won't last
You'll die.
We all will.
It's April here in Algeria
This school was built in 2013
He's long gone
I'm up to my neck in debt
It's finally our turn
So, are you enjoying it here?
No way!
Tom's car is older than Mary's
We didn't invite Tom to stay
She's an anorexic woman
How many people are there now?
So, two hundred it is, right?
We don't have anything left
I'm done trying to help you
Tom isn't well enough to work
How come?
It's closed on Sundays
It's about time to go
Dad, Maria hit me!
That is not possible!
Dad, Tom hit me!
Mom, Tom hit me!
Will Tom tell us the truth?
Who's John Bull?
There should've been a plan
Has Tom agreed to our terms?
A Greek coffee, please
They are, indeed
I’m indeed
What will it take?
What would it take?
Do you forgive me?
Is anyone out there?
Which horse does the boy see?
I don't lose them
That's the question of the day
Would you like to eat with me?
What do you think Tom meant?
We're close to making a deal
Why's Tom's plan better?
My kid's not like your kid
Tomorrow I'm going shopping
Where's my cookie?
I ate it all.
I bought this book for 300 yen
Mom, the kettle is boiling
I'm a business major
Don't drive that close to it
Where's my cake?
I ate it all.
Tom isn't a good neighbor
What did you buy in the shop?
She kissed you, didn't she?
Tom isn't my sister's son
He's my son
It's good to meet you both
Tom isn't getting worried
He's already worried
We'll hold hands
Tom isn't fooling anybody
It's time for us to leave here
We'll meet you guys there
Doing that wouldn't help
I didn't do shit all day
The pain won't last very long
Can you buy your old car back?
Tom isn't making progress
What a weirdo!
Tom isn't a forest ranger
Is today Saturday already?
We weren't allowed to leave
We don't do this enough
That's not possible, is it?
You can't do that, right?
That's not allowed, right?
We'll see about that later
You haven't figured it out?
He doesn't like eating fish
Tom isn't fooling anyone
Cheap, isn't it?
It's cheap, isn't it?
Those are cheap, aren't they?
They're cheap, aren't they?
This is cheap, isn't it?
These are cheap, aren't they?
Is it winter already?
Nobody knows I'm a furry
No one knows I'm a furry
Nobody knows I'm polyamorous
No one knows I'm polyamorous
My French isn't very good
Is it easy to learn French?
Do you want me to invite Tom?
I really don't like him
Now I'm staying
I don't just watch TV
I do other things, too
I just don't want to
I just don't want to do it
Who are you going to invite?
I don't think that's relevant
Of course, I didn't need it
Tom isn't waiting for you
He's waiting for me
Tom isn't alone with Mary
Tom isn't still in prison
I went to Boston.
Where else did you go?
I went to Chicago, too.
We ate spaghetti and pizza.
What else did you eat?
They didn't buy the novel
Tom isn't a very busy man
He's still in bed
Mount what?
Not cool, man
How did you dare to do that?
It wasn't me
It was Joe.
Does he smoke a lot?
Some details aren't yet known
That doesn't happen too often
These shoes won't last long
I can't deal with cases
Do you need a reminder?
I didn't want to live there
Are you sure that's true?
Yes!
Don't buy that one
It doesn't matter
I am a bit out of shape!
I'm not sure it's right
Can you get there in time?
Did they come up with it?
Can I talk with Bill?
It's obviously impossible
I've been paying Tom's bills
I guess Tom won't come today
Tom isn't engaged to Mary
He's a peace seeker
He's peaceful
I'm mincing my words
Tom didn't have a toothbrush
It's all much simpler
Can I pet it?
They're sold out
You can't buy experience
That's part of our game plan
Now, let me get this straight
Tom isn't conceited
They're your children
Here's how you can help
There's a scratch on this lens
Are my eyes red?
Who would know how to do this?
Do I also need to talk to Tom?
We've got a plan
The last eruption was in 2013
I'll ask Tom to wash the car
How was the party last night?
Will you open the door for me?
What is this pathos for?
What is all this pathos for?
Don't be afraid to laugh
Your name isn't on my list
Tom didn't know anyone there
Tom didn't know anybody there
How long do you need my bike?
Oh, I was just about to leave
Tom isn't waiting outside
He's waiting in the lobby
Is caffeine bad for you?
Tom doesn't watch the news
I don't let you go
That's not the point at all
Tom isn't like his father
He's much more like his mother
Tom isn't still at school
Stay here, and don't move
That's not something I'd do
Who did this for you?
Can you help us in here?
This goat isn't hard to milk
Goats aren't very hard to milk
Yanni's goats have large teats
Yanni cleaned his goat's udder
Yanni's goat is hard to milk
Are goats difficult to milk?
Yanni's goat likes to kick
Yanni's goat is hard to milk
Yanni's goat is a kicker
Tom isn't washing his car
He's washing Mary's car
They're coming your way
They're coming your way
Don't test my anger
That's all you deserve
That's all you'll take
That's all you'll do
That's all you'll read
Still, that's not a bad deal
Tom isn't holding a knife
He's holding a gun
Tom isn't in his room
She doesn't like to lose
She's insanely jealous
Who did that to you?
Ya...
Who?
Yan...
Yanni?
Ya...
Ya...
Yanni is Ziri's golfing buddy
Will Marika read my letter?
Tom isn't doing very well
Tom isn't building a wall
He's putting up a fence
Something didn't seem right
Tom isn't a heavy drinker
Tom isn't reading a novel
He's reading a biography
It seems like it's a done deal
Tom isn't angry with Mary
How long did you wait for Tom?
There's Tokyo
Have a nice life!
Of course, it was all my fault
I didn't eat yesterday
I didn't eat dinner yesterday
Guess what happened to me!
I'll take him back to my house
Who gave me the evil eye?
Tom is acting like he's sick
Are you going on foot?
This isn't what we want to do
It's shaped like an octagon
We didn't have time for that
Is Tom really that dangerous?
This isn't really a big deal
This plan isn't new at all
That's what I needed to hear
Hasn't Tom left yet?
Has Tom stopped crying yet?
It's one of Tom's triggers
It didn't seem to work
Tom isn't washing the car
Here's a little gift for you
It's late
That's a personal matter
It's a question of time
That's how it's been since
Your father doesn't trust you
It's a family
What type of person does that?
Why should I keep a diary?
It's not a diary
It's a journal.
What's the difference?
That's not what a diary is
Tom isn't being realistic
These are professionals?
What's your long-term plan
Yanni washed his goat's teats
Yanni's goat kicks a lot
Milking doesn't hurt goats
Yanni's milk tastes goaty
His car is yellow, I think
It’s 8:00 am
Do you want to buy some milk?
I still can't hear you
Tom isn't still one of us
We're all out of grog, Captain
Yanni died in custody in 2004
Why are monkeys so funny?
We didn't do our best
Tom isn't our best player
If you come, I'll bake a cake
Visit me again soon!
Can I keep the money?
That is a well-known song
Has she received my letter?
You can't drive drunk
Until now it's going well
Do you want to eat an egg?
Finally we have found you!
Wait, let me put this down
Tom isn't a very friendly kid
Shall I cut the onions?
Tom isn't in the basement
I'm getting into a rut
That's not part of our plan
My sister's smoking
My brother's smoking
You can't hold a candle to him
I've shed many tears, my lord
I'd like to see it in any case
It's summer
I'd like your help with this
Tom isn't a good wrestler
I'll tell you what!
Are they Hungarian?
No, they're Belgian.
Where can I study Esperanto?
When will she do that?
Tom didn't think he'd survive
We're going to Rome for a week
Tom isn't good at drawing
You shouldn't be too picky
You shouldn't be too careful
You shouldn't look too closely
It's sort of interesting
Is Tom going to play with us?
Tom isn't a dermatologist
Well, that's only part of it
Does it not taste good?
No, it's delicious
Good Idea!
Now stop!
Why have you done that?
Has Tom left the hospital yet?
Yeah?
You should've seen that coming
Tom isn't still the champ
There's no dog in the yard
How many horses do you own?
Have you heard what happened?
Here, I'll lend you my bike
Tom isn't a heavy sleeper
That isn't what we need to do
Tom isn't younger than me
He's of average height
Tom isn't smarter than me
We won't likely hear from Tom
Let's not tell Tom about that
The museum's closed on Mondays
How was Tom's surgery?
Could we have some privacy?
Why's everyone leaving?
Why's everybody leaving?
I'm not trying to be rude
That's all I have
There's nothing left
Do you all have pencils?
Don't you feel tired?
I'll always level with you
I'll keep the car and the dog
Do you all have umbrellas?
Does everybody have pens?
Does everybody have paper?
Is this book good?
I've started already
I can't work now
I'm a busy man now
The food here isn't very good
Many people don't believe that
Move, I can't see the TV
No!
Don't tell me that!
How do I file a complaint?
How can I file a complaint?
I'm listening to Bach now
Why would Tom commit suicide?
Why would Tom kill himself?
Why do we like cute things?
You'll need to wait
Do you?
I swear I'm not drunk
I swear I'm not high
It's my first time coming here
How about you?
Don't buy what you don't need
It's OK
I can't do anything about that
Balance isn't always easy
I'm sorry
We're messing with my sister
Tom isn't still a student
What a beautiful site!
Now you see why I can't leave
Tom isn't a horse trainer
That's a big part of it
Please don't forget my name
I couldn't find the off switch
Tom isn't a music teacher
OK, let's all calm down
She's courted heavily
Tom isn't shorter than me
Tom isn't drinking beer
He's drinking wine
Really?" "...No.
Tom isn't right this time
Come here, man
Tom isn't on duty tonight
Don't twist my words
I've broken my leg
This hat wasn't cheap
I can't ski all that well
I don't like wearing hats
That's true, for sure
Nobody's done it yet
No one's done it yet
You'd better stay quiet
What was the movie about?
Do you want milk in your tea?
Don't be bitter
When were you in the army?
Tom isn't used to waiting
I'm a bit out of shape
I'm a little out of shape
I'm not sure this is right
Is that a dog or a wolf?
That's a nice-looking T-shirt
That isn't allowed, is it?
That's not allowed, is it?
Please don't bother me now
I want criticism!
That's a well-known song
Everything's OK so far
Leave some for me, too
Leave something for me, too
Don't eat all the cake
That isn't possible, is it?
Here's your cup of tea
Granny's cookies are inedible
Tom doesn't know Boston well
Have you ever killed a man?
Don't keep me waiting all day
Tom isn't eating a banana
Is it hard to milk a goat?
These numbers don't match
Have you ever milked a goat?
Can you flip the switch?
Don't point that thing at me
What have you got over there?
I'm sick of eating sausages
I've seen better
Do you want an umbrella?
Unicorns don't exist
Can you turn the music down?
You'll regret that
You've been quiet, what's up?
Who authored this book?
Tom isn't in the other room
It's a miracle you're alive
I'll be home tomorrow evening
Why are pigs so smart?
Tom isn't Mary's only son
You should, of course, say no
I'll teach you how to sew
Could you move it, please?
I'd never want to live here
Tom isn't a soccer player
I think that I've lost my keys
I think I've lost my keys
You don't look very concerned
Who gave these flowers to you?
What time are we having lunch?
Can you get here before 2:30?
Is there still some food left?
I'll take care of it
I'll take care of everything
Tom isn't such a nice guy
It's supposed to be warm today
That's not the deal we made
Tom isn't in the building
Tom isn't a very nice kid
Tom isn't drinking coffee
He's drinking tea
I've had such a busy morning
That isn't what I meant at all
We'll die!
Today's too hot for sunbathing
Whoever told you that's a liar
Have you found any?
The boss said that we're fired
I don't earn more than you
I can't eat
Ugh, I can't eat either
Let's eat everything
I don't feel like it right now
What's a screwdriver for?
Do I still have time left?
I'm happy with these shoes
The sun doesn't shine here
It's hot in the summer
They won't stop calling me
The sales tax isn't included
I'm washing the shirt
It's raining a lot
I'll sign the contract later
They're going to get mad at me
They'll get mad with me
I'm plucking my eyebrows
Mary isn't sick
Ask me if you don't understand
I can't go back to jail
It doesn't rain, it snows
I'll get told off
Next time I'm taking the train
I don't have a sofa at home
Pay the bill when you're done
It's been two years
Long live the Revolution!
Long live Esperanto!
I'll be unable to help you
Tom isn't a very nice boy
Please, I'm asking you
Don't be a hindrance right now
Tom isn't willing to help
What is your second language?
Tom isn't based in Boston
He's based in Chicago
I'll fix it myself
There's a deal to be had
Do you know what an abacus is?
Where did he learn Romanian?
Did you sit in the back?
You've got to deal with it
Can you turn down the music?
Where should I look?
Where should I search?
You know it's not like that
Is he back yet?
Is she back yet?
You're all late
You're not on time
How's everyone?
I'm down
I'm feeling sad
Why don't they go home?
How many eyes do you have?
How many hands do you have?
Two.
Tom lives on a one-way street
Add new sentences!
You shouldn't do this work
It was a set-up
We don't have a lot of food
We don't have a lot to eat
We don't have much to eat
We didn't have much to eat
How much of the stew is left?
How much stew is left?
How close is that island?
Did I do it?
Did I succeed?
What's your second language?
We're gonna do great!
Have you got it?
I could've never guessed that
Care to go for another round?
Care to try?
Did she lose?
Did he lose?
How could you have lost?
Don't go overboard
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
I didn't even stand a chance
I didn't stand a chance
He didn't stand a chance
She didn't stand a chance
Where is that from?
What is that from?
That's a lot better
Have you caught on yet?
They haven't caught on yet
They'll never catch on
It'll never catch on
It'll never become popular
Are you running a fever?
When is she coming?
When is he coming?
Hey, no spoilers!
Don't spoil anything!
No spoilers!
Love is a two-way street
Friendship is a two-way street
In my dream, Tom was you
In my dream, I was you
In my dream, you were me
In my dream, I wasn't me
In my dream, you were Tom
Don't tell me to be like you
You've met Tom, haven't you?
There is power in the union!
Tom denied that he'd done that
I wonder what'll happen next
She's not always hungry
It's a big deal to us
Let's see if this still works
How many eyes hast thou?
'Tis two
How many hands hast thou?
'Tis two.
Tom isn't going to try that
Are these Tom's sunglasses?
Let's do it right
Tom isn't the one who won
Now let's not get carried away
I didn't sit in the front
Tom isn't smoking a cigar
He's smoking a pipe
We'd hoped to buy more time
Let's put this in the boot
I won't work for Tom
Does the machine still work?
Where were you guys?
Would you be interested?
I didn't feel like it
So what exactly happened?
Take the book and read!
Tom isn't willing to wait
I'm telling it like it is
He's turned green with envy
I'm carrying owls to Athens
She doesn't love him anymore
She's rather shy
How long is Tom's hair?
Yes, of course, I remember you
Is he Italian?
Do you prefer wine or whisky?
She's indebted to you
Tom isn't working tonight
That's the end of the song
Do you know what Tom bought?
How about we sit over there?
Don't let them do this to us
She didn't even try to deny it
Tom didn't even try to deny it
I'd like a glass of champagne
Are you curious about it?
What do you do at home?
Don't walk on the flower bed
Why didn't you call me?
Do you like Spanish cuisine?
They've got a lot to do
Don't worry, it'll be okay
What's wrong?
You don't look too happy
He's definitely no gentleman
Can I talk with Tom?
Tom isn't a very smart boy
Have you ever eaten a loquat?
Tom isn't my youngest son
It's old, but I still love it
I'm not a conservative
Tom isn't my only brother
Hopefully, that'll happen
Mary is thirty, too
Mary is thirty-two
Of course, it was your fault
Have you ever shot anyone?
Have you ever killed anyone?
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Have you ever loved anyone?
Have you ever helped anyone?
I'll always tell you the truth
He's scared
Algeria won the war.
Algeria always wins its wars.
Algeria will win.
Algeria always wins.
Tom can't stand vegetarians
Tom can't stand vegetables
That's hard for me to believe
You're nothing but a whore
It's nice to finally meet you
Tom isn't a jazz musician
It's really nice to meet you
I don't wish to buy this shirt
Don't touch that kid
I won't buy this sweater
It's a dangerous time

Is this part of your plan?

What time does school end?
What time is school over?
I'll live mine
He's from Teresina
Hello, good evening
How can I help you?
I can't install that
Is that couple Swiss?
Here's a question for you
Tom isn't a strong swimmer
You're scaring me
What's that mean?
What is that supposed to be?
How are you?
I'm good, thanks for asking.
How are we doing today?
How is it going today?
That didn't last very long
Tom wasn't shouting at Mary
Where do I pay?
I'm a Real Madrid fan
Have you ever been to Rome?
I haven't read your letter yet
I've run out of food
Do you want a hot sandwich?
Why is this song so catchy?
Everything's a drama with you
Ah, that's true," Susan put in
I just wanted to call...
I loved Season 2
Don't tell Tom I was here
You can't cancel on Tom
Tom isn't a physics major
He's a chemistry major
That's the plan at this point
I'd never dare to do that
I wouldn't dare do that
She couldn't have done it
She couldn't have gotten out
This is Johnny Cash, right?
Would you like to go with us?
That's where I used to live
The door wasn't locked
They've made mistakes
Are you scared of dogs?
Tom isn't alone right now
Tom isn't a piano teacher
It wasn't a big deal to me
Yanni didn't believe that
I'm not going to choose him
I didn't pick it
I didn't choose him
Yanni buried Skura's body
Yann'is body was unearthed
Yanni's mom is gone
Yanni's mom is in heaven
Yanni is an orphan.
What do you mean?

Your wife shot you?
My wife...

911
What's your emergency?
I shot my husband.
You're such a loser
I've had it with you
Tom isn't trying very hard
Will I need to do this again?
Tom isn't doing a good job
What does that needle contain?
We need everybody's help
Tom isn't in the lunchroom
Is Israel above the law?
Tom isn't any smarter than you
Right now, that isn't the plan
Poverty shouldn't exist
It won't happen overnight
We didn't find anything to eat
Tom isn't in the back yard
You'll have to wait a while
Where do you want me to stand?

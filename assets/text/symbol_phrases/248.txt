Goodbye, then
Good evening!
I'm Mary, a friend of Tom's

She's a liar
They know that's the truth
Don't use this tap
You can't use this tap
It's out of order
You want to marry Maria!
I have a pink-coloured car
I'm gutted
I am extremely disappointed.
I'm gutted.

I met Tom at the weekend.
What?
Really?
Does he know anything?
Does she know anything?
You are disgusting!
You know it well!
How long does it take to plan?
Should we go and buy that?
Who's this I'm talking to?
It's just an accident!
Why are we so behind on this?
Should we order a takeaway?
Truth is like the sun!
You're entering the lion's den
I don't want to be seen
We can't deny this fact
We can't dispute this fact
No, not at all
Well, it would bother me.
Tom can't stop chattering
As long as I write, I live
Stop while you still can!
You are mankind's last hope
Full stop!
Don't do that yet
Do you still swim?
Couldn't Tom help?
You're very slow
You're too pushy
You're too picky
You're too noisy
You're too bossy
You're a scumbag
Why can't you go?
Who's behind you?
Where's room 303?
When's the party?
My gun's missing
It's almost dawn
Isn't Tom afraid?
Is doing that OK?
I've got the key
I'm getting cold
I'm drinking tea
I know it's over
How late was Tom?
Does Tom do that?
Yes, I did that
Why do you work?
Who's that lady?
Who scolded Tom?
Tom's boat sank
Tom isn't heavy
I'm not excited
You're yawning
You're strange
You're a creep
You're a bully
You'll be next
Who's not here?
Who'll do that?
Was Tom afraid?
My dog's brown
My cup's empty
I've confessed
I'm undefeated
I'm suspicious
I'm really sad
I know I'm fat
Don't eat that
Do you do that?
Are you OK now?
May I do that?
Is Tom afraid?
I'm very weak
I'm an expert
I'm unharmed
We're lucky
I'm outside
I'm injured
I'm anxious
I'm annoyed
Do that, OK?
I'm insane
I'm filthy
I'm amazed
Is he Tom?
Was the teacher young?
Was the notebook blue?
Are the old chairs brown?
Is the new teacher fat?
Is the new student good?
That's a bad translation
What was there under the lamp?
That's a large table
What time are you setting off?
She's a head shorter than I am
What are you like?
This is my teacher's bag
Haven't you done anything yet?
It's good for people's health
In English, of course.
In English, of course.
Beware of her!
Are you angry with me?
Yes, a little bit.
Let’s mine that ship
Shall this be thrown away?
Do you prefer spring or fall?
I've locked the front door
Is the coffee strong enough?
I'm suffocating
Warning, do not panic
So when did you decide that?
Where are you, then?
Get up children!
Thomas, what are you doing?
They don't have anything
I'm already there
Don't bother; they're here
What does that mean?
I haven't the faintest idea
Shouldn't you be at school?
You have no reason to be sad!
Why can't giraffes sing?
What's a typical day for you?
I'm on your heels
I'm on your tail
We haven't bought any bread
Have you registered that here?
He won't answer any more
My girlfriend has 3 nipples
We'll start from the beginning
We'll start from scratch
Yet, stay!
There's no loo roll left!
They're huge!
That's right and proper!
The boy's as fit as a fiddle!
Are you still asleep?
That's how Tom became famous
My great-uncle speaks Frisian
It's really not a good idea
I just want to sleep!
Tom's a mediocre painter
Give me my glasses, please
You'll play football soon
I'll call him before I go
We'll write a letter
Cross me off the list!
There's no loo paper left!
Why did you open the door?
Are you angry with me?
Actually, very much.
How can I make up for it?
What time did they all return?
Tom's not very fat
Such is life!
But?
It'll go well
Why did they name her that?
No, madam, not yet.
We are not afraid!
We're not afraid!
Are you a doctor?
Is this your daughter?
Who could've thought!
She's so grown up!
How many copies do you need?
Can I invite my friend?
Can I come with my friend?
What are you doing?
I'm thinking.
To get rid of self-conceit
Let me try you.
Why are you acting like this?
Don't be afraid!
You're wearing odd socks
It's exactly as you say
See you next week !
Do you already use Amikumu?
It's raining heavily
Insects have six legs.
That's exactly how it is.
Wait a bit!
What should I do?
I couldn't give a monkey's
It's become warmer today
It's got warmer today
Why is my sister stupid?
I'm not stupid!
You're not my sister!
Stop whingeing!
Don't you want a unicorn, Tom?
Oh, go on then, I'll take one.
I'm not trying to be sexy
Do you have much free time?
I'm eating breakfast
I'm having breakfast
Oh, come on!
We're watching the film
We're watching a film
Elvis lives!
I can't any more!
You look tired, Mary.
Why don't you know it?
Did you see the eclipse?
Did you watch the eclipse?
I'm trouting
The stakes couldn't be higher
Do you have more milk?
Did you hear the cat miaowing?
Tom always was a glutton.
Forget everything I told you!
You impress me!
Let's go
The car's waiting outside
Tom is self-absorbed
She insisted, but I said no
He insisted, but I said no
Mary looked into Tom's eyes
You're asking a lot
You're asking a lot of me
Do you have a red crayon?
It's really complicated
How is your love life going?
How is your love life?
Ten more days, then spring!
May we never end up that way!
Didn't we just say we'd do it?
Rest in peace!
I'm languishing for you
Tom has a full-sleeve tattoo
I don't know
Why don't you ask him?
I don't know
Why don't you ask her?
We're just friends, seriously!
I missed you a lot.
I missed you too!
I'm not really surprised
Is that blood on your clothes?
I will activate my robot!
It's not democracy at all
Dawn came after six o'clock
Are you lucky or unlucky?
Why are some people shy?
Tom's computer crashed
Mary just couldn't stop crying
Will I be able to walk again?
Tom couldn't move his legs
It's rude
I'm not able to repair my car
That is self-destruction
Tom's back seized up
Flee before it's too late
Who's there?" called the Wolf
That is to eat thee up.
Ha! how beautiful she is!
Let me see if I can do it.
You have waited a long while.
O! madam!" cried the head cook
We're business partners
You're really bad at it
It's great!
No, you clean it!
I'm not your skivvy!" she said
We're leaving.
But you just got here.
I'm leaving.
But you just got here.
Life wasn't easy
Ah!
O fatal victory!
Ah!
But I fear to kiss it!
Are you in Naples?
Ah!
She's Austrian
She's from Austria
Tatoeba is back!
You're acting really weird
What's wrong?
Do you want to go on a date?
Go where?
Sorry, I can't hear you
See you tomorrow.
How was your ride, Princess?
Decide already!
That doesn't make it right!
I don't want to end up in jail
Surely, you can't be serious?
O Nymphs!
I know it, my dear Daphnis.
Perhaps you had forgotten me.
He's blue
Who said that to them?
Alas!
Alas!
Alas!
Take me off the list!
Who likes Brazilian music?
I do!
What a wonderful concert!
My neighbor's dog is barking
Ah!
These keyboards don't work
Ah!
Farewell Daphnis!
It's your wife on the phone
She says it's urgent
I don't know him either
I've no time to study
Heaven?
What did I say?
How much time do we save?
Gondolas don't have sails
I'm setting the table
Should I set the table?
Who was his professor?
Who was her professor?
She's studying graphic design
Come on, we need to hustle
I'm not claustrophobic
Wow!
Wow!
What's that?
What does it look like?
Tom invested in Mary's company
You're not like everyone else
Tom came to Mary's rescue
Am I free to go?
Told ya so!
What am I sitting on?
What are you twaddling now?
All of you are crazy!
What's your problem with him?
Do you hear this sound, Maria?
Where does it come from?
I'm afraid!
I'm not going to Berlin
I've changed my mind
There's no harm in trying
It's all I can say
What is it, Mary?
What's wrong?
What is it, Tom?
What's wrong?
Is it dinner already?
Don't get mad, okay?
It's fee for the admission
Can I get some help?
Excuse me, may we sit here?
Did you like everything?
How big she is already!
Be patient!
I've already paid
A man's character is his fate
I hope to see you again soon!
I knew you wouldn't come
I didn't think you'd come
That's your boss' job
That's it, I want a divorce
I couldn't wait to see her
I couldn't wait to see him
I wasn't expecting you
That won't placate the mob
I'm about to jet
I'll manage just fine
It's a perk of the job
It's of no use to me
I've got nothing against it
Get out of the way!
I'm doing this to spite you
She's doing her hair
You did this?
All by yourselves?
Which one is old?
Speak low, if you speak love
Are you able to do that?
Is anybody afraid?

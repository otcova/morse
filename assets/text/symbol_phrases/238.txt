How could it be my fault?
How did we get this deal?
Why isn't Tom resigning?
I'm thrilled to be here
How did you get that job?
Why was Tom there alone?
How did you get the idea?
How did Tom get up there?
I don't want to eat that
How do we deal with that?
How do you like my dress?
I didn't ask Tom to sing
How can I?
I'm not sorry
She's a meddlesome old gossip
Run along, child
What is the matter with them?
I didn't like it a bit
How do you make a living?
How far is it to the zoo?
How long can I stay here?
Can I go?
It isn't heavy
It's past eight
It's so pathetic
Isn't that pretty?
Well, what's next?
I've been insulted
Where are the oars?
Can't we be friends?
I'll try to be good
I'll do my very best
I'm ready to confess
Tom won't forgive me
You're so kind to me
Am I talking too much?
How did the others do?
I guess you're hungry
Tom's ankle is broken
I didn't like it a bit
I'll do all the chores
Tom's mind was made up
Doesn't Mary look lovely?
Excuse me a minute, Tom
I can't stay here alone
They're always laughing
We'll never forget this
What spices did you use?
Why didn't anybody come?
I don't speak to Tom now
I hope I didn't hurt Tom
I'd love to be a teacher
Isn't that too expensive?
I can't go to school today
It's tremendously exciting
What flavoring did you use?
What would you advise, Tom?
Why don't you like it here?
I'm really glad you like it
It's a kind of pretty place
Tom's hair isn't red, is it?
I guess I'll have to do that
Is Tom going to school today?
Has Tom eaten anything at all?
Don't you worry about me a bit
Don't fidget
Did you touch it?
We're nearly home
I'll be back next year
I'll get up at sunrise
Tom says you're bright
I didn't mean to meddle
I know I'll be punished
I suppose I'd better go
I'm glad Tom liked them
I'm such an unlucky guy
Don't you know who Tom is?
It's extremely interesting
Tomorrow is Tom's birthday
I think that's all nonsense
I'm so glad it's warm today
I've been crying like a baby
It was Tom's idea to do that
I didn't let Tom in the house
I hope you didn't disturb Tom
I was so tired I couldn't eat
I wish I didn't have to leave
What've you done to your hair?
I think I've sprained my ankle
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go
I'm going to Boston in October
Tom didn't say much about that
You don't know how tired I was
I've been so happy
I've been here for a year
It's kind of you, Fadil
Don't exaggerate, Jamal
How old are you really?
Don't lie to me
Let's see what we can do
Here's some ice
You're all wet
I didn't go to my classes.
How come?
Where did you get to?
Why didn't you invite him in?
Were they really good-looking?
Did you ask him his number?
I love you.
I love you, too.
Would that be difficult?
When does he get back?
She's new here
She didn't like coffee
I'll get outside
I can't hear you well
I'll get outside
What did you tell your friend?
I'll go over and see her
Don't bother yourself
I'll give you the anesthetic
It's not gonna hurt
You can't leave like this
What type of work does Tom do?
What kind of work does Tom do?
We're not going to lose
Tom says he won't stay
I don't mind doing that
I don't want any dinner
I'll never come back here
Can you wash dishes tonight?
I don't want anything to eat
You shouldn't talk about Tom
Did you hear what I said, Tom?
I don't know what you did
How long was your flight?
Tom's desk is next to Mary's
Do you like me?
To be honest, I hate your guts
No offence.
None taken.
I'm learning Aramaic
I never thought you'd mind.
I've never been to a picnic
Do you have a minute to talk?
I know you are.
Stick to the subject!
How shameless you are!
How fearless you are!
Those were good times!
I still don't see it
They'll go on arriving late
Would you, please, hurry up?
Have you thought about it?
Your opinion doesn't count
Did you reach any agreement?
They'll go on not eating fruit
They'll go on lazing around
They'll go on pigheaddedly
I don't speak to her now
It was my fault, Mr. Phillips
Don't you understand, Marilla?
I've been insulted
I still can't dance
I love Diana so, Marilla
And oh, what shall I do?
I don't remember doing it
How long will this go on?
How many cars do you own?
I haven't sung in a while
How often do you do this?
Tom's gun is missing
Tom's parents are missing
Tom doesn't like to sing
How worried should we be?
We're gonna have a baby
Don't be afraid, Jamal
Have some coffee, Jamal
This isn't all, Fadil
I'd say you are in love
It's miles away
What are you thinking about?
Nothing special.
Are you OK?
Let's try now
What happened to that man?
What's all this about, guys?
And the flowers?
They're for you.
You turned off the engine.
I'll wait.
You don't need to wait for me
I'll invite her for dinner
That's not a dream
Cut it out, will you?
I'm soaked to the skin
I'm soaked to the skin.
So am I.
You'll never guess who this is
You've got to guess
What happened to me, guys?
This isn't like him at all
What's this?
Open it.
I can't accept this present
I'll open it for you
I don't wanna talk about that
Can I help you, Sir?
I'm hoping he can help me
I'm looking for Jamal
Thank you.
It was a pleasure.
Jamal?
What is he doing here?
Do you know who her friend is?
I'm Jamal, Sarah's husband
So are you married to Sarah?
Shall we go for some coffee?
I can't leave the office
I'm sorry
I've got work to do
I'm Tom, Mary's husband
I'm Mary, Tom's wife
I'm sorry, Sir.
But no repeats.
I've never had a boyfriend
Most men don't even look at me
It wasn't the right moment
That's what we don't know
This way, Sir
I don't understand.
Is she talking to herself?
Are you spying on us?
You just don't trust me
I wasn't watching you
Where are you going?
I'm warning you
You're hurting me, Jamal
I'm afraid of being betrayed
Is there anything wrong, Sir?
I don't want you to understand
Who asked you anything?
How did that wallet get there?
We have to talk, Jamal
It's quite normal.
Is that so hard to understand?
We're holding back traffic
He doesn't have much time left
Jamal is not a saint.
Yet I trust him.
I can't leave you there
I'm so afraid of him
I didn't care anymore
Who cared about me?
Please come in, Sir
Just leave me, please
I don't have much time to tidy
Why are you here, Jamal?
You're my lovely little baby
What if it was serious?
Tell me about it, Jamal
He's going to his room
Did you have an accident?
Nothing happened.
I'll go and see
In that case, so be it
May I go?
Very well.
Just say Jamal isn't here
I'll call Jamal tomorrow
Don't wait for me
Give me your hand, Jamal
Don't go yet, please
So do I.
Drink this, Jamal
You'll feel better
We don't want it anymore
She doesn't deserve him
What do you expect her to do?
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Please don't thank me
You're the boss
Do you need help, buddy?
We don't need to worry
That's no way to live
We haven't had a talk for ages
It's to be expected
I know something isn't right
I'm bad
I'm mad
I'm new
I'll die
I'll win
I'm a DJ
I'm deaf
I'm fast
I'm good
I'm high
I'm last
I'm neat
I'm numb
I'm slow
I'll come
I'll fail
I'll lose
I'm a CPA
I'm a fan
I'm alive
I'm bossy
I'm naive
I'm picky
I'm pudgy
I'm scary
I'm sharp
I'm silly
I'm small
I'm tense
I'm tipsy
I'm wrong
We don't have any cream
I'm starving.
Jamal, hold on
Don't complain, Jamal
I've come to see Jamal.
Come in.
Why on earth did he do that?
I can't just give up on Jamal
I don't want us to finish
I don't want us to separate
Does Sarah know about Jenny?
Is your boyfriend here?
I thought he'd be here
It's a tricky situation
Make yourself comfortable, man
Jamal didn't say anything
What's wrong with it?
He still isn't back yet
Are you making tea for me?
No, for Jamal.
It'll help.
I wanna have a word with you.
Sure, what is it?
Not one word, understand?
Did you tell Jamal?
Please don't tell Jamal
Maybe I don't have a choice
Do you need any help, buddy?
Have you set the table?
I'll help you, buddy
I'm gonna tell Jamal tomorrow
That's the end of the story
Give it to me, Jamal
Not surprising.
Have you seen Jamal?
Does that car belong to Jamal?
We've all agreed
I'm OK now
I'm a cook
I'm a monk
I'm a poet
I'm a temp
I'm a wimp
I'm bright
I'm clever
I'm crafty
I'm driven
I'm frugal
I'm groggy
I'm not OK
I'm not in
I'm stable
I'm stupid
I'm unhurt
I'm unsure
I'm untidy
I'm winded
I can't ski
I'm a boxer
I'm a guard
I'm a minor
I'm a model
I'm a pilot
I'm a rebel
I'm bipolar
I'm packing
I'm pleased
I'm shaving
I'm up next
I called 911
I dialed 911
I won't stay
I'm a golfer
I'm a priest
I'm like Tom
I'm not neat
I'm not thin
I'm your age
I have a Ph.D
I've left home
I'm not a bigot
I'm not a moron
I'm not a maniac
I'm not clueless
I'm still a minor
I can't work today
I was here at 2:30
It's really very good
You hate me, don't you?
No, I don't.
Well, you love me, don't you?
Why do you ask?
It's so hot
It's so cold in here
It's so hot in here
I'm learning Vietnamese
I'm learning Kazakh
I'm learning Old English
What's your native dialect?
Is that your native accent?
This isn't my real accent
This isn't my native accent
That's just a quirk of his
Tom doesn't sing anymore
How would we get it done?
I'll try and do something
How would you do the job?
I'm even more excited now
I'm gonna watch football
I'm taking some summer classes
I'm not a total idiot
A touchdown is worth 6 points
Tom's tweet was retweeted
Tom squeezed Mary's shoulder
There, there, child, don't cry
Don't be foolish, Anne
You shouldn't say such things
I'll try to be a model pupil
What way do you vote, Matthew?
Tom cleaned Mary's car
Isn't it a wonderful morning?
And what if you disappoint?
Don't change!
He doesn't remember anything
I'm going to do just that
How big a problem is that?
She's a very religious woman
Why are barns red?
Tom hasn't read the letter yet
I don't really know what to do
How big a problem is this?
I'm sorry that I did that
How can I do what's right?
I'm very upset about that
How can people be so dumb?
I hope you won't do that
What on earth did Tom mean?
I don't mind how much you talk
I'm not going to Boston
I wonder if Mary went, too
I wonder if Mary can, too
Will you please call me Tom?
I'll go and have another look
You've been working too much
What's gone wrong now?
I don't think I like Tom much
I wasn't trying to be funny
Tom must've been very unhappy
Tom promised he'd do his best
Do you want more money?
It's not gonna be easy
I've made you a cup of coffee
Here's your coffee
I can't concentrate on my work
They don't know where you were
We'll talk about that
We're here to see you
We're studying together
Where is Jamal now?
Is there a problem, Jamal?
You're here early today
Keep up the good work, buddy
I'm here on a trial period
Hi there, good morning
I wanna see if I'm pregnant
She's the problem
How can you not like this?
I don't think they're safe
How did you get this idea?
She's serious about her work
What is the problem, Jamal?
I don't want to play games
How did you pass the time?
You can come back by 3:30
I'm just resting for a moment
I guess I'm just romantic
How did you spend the day?
Is she a patient here?
You can't just go up there
It's personal.
He's selling flowers
I'm Sarah's husband
And what do you want?
You mean it doesn't matter?
Don't you see that, Jamal?
Did you tell Sarah?
I couldn't find Sarah
She's here for sure
I'm here waiting for her
I'll do that myself
I don't want his flowers
Who says I have any secrets?
I don't wanna see him
Is this Jamal?
Excuse me, Doctor
I'm not selling flowers
They're looking for someone
It's his problem
It's none of my business
He wasn't quite right
Was there a problem?
Something with my father?
Please give me a painkiller.
I can't give you one yet.
Come back later, Sir
He's brought you flowers
We didn't do it on purpose
You'll pay for it
Can we run now?
Just say that I can't see him
What if he insists?
He's on his way back here
Let's tell him what happened
Is that what she said?
He's just tired of waiting
We're gonna be late
Give it to me, Tom
Why isn't Tom coming?
Have some coffee, Tom
Are you married to Tom?
Don't complain so much
Give me your hand, Tom
You're hurting me, Tom
Don't you see that, Tom?
Did you manage to call Tom?
Does that car belong to Tom?
Why isn't Tom coming tonight?
Did you really do that to Tom?
Drink this, Tom
You'll feel better
You know what this is?
You're no a child anymore
These flowers can't stay here
And who else?
Here you go.
Thank you.
Did you check all the CDs?
Are they OK?
Thank you for helping me, pal
It's useless
I don't care
I'll pay
Do we have the money?
I'd like to do things properly
I'll never quit
I've won the race
He's not gonna quit
You want it?
I know what I'm doing
I'm totally in control
I thought he wasn't coming
It's perfect
He wasn't always like that
I just don't have time
Really, I'm going
I'd like to know something
I'm Fadil Sadiq
We've met before.
Here's Fadil
What on earth happened here?
How difficult can that be?
Tom wouldn't do anything
How do I apply for a visa?
Guess who Tom's father is?
How do I open this window?
How did Tom get to Boston?
How do we fix the problem?
How much does Tom owe you?
How do you deal with that?
What if the cake doesn't rise?
Anne, taste it yourself
I suppose it's partly my fault
I'm disgraced forever
I'm so impatient to see her
You'll fall off and be killed.
What's the matter?
Where have you hurt yourself?
My ankle," gasped Anne
Anne's ankle was broken
Merry Christmas, Marilla!
Merry Christmas, Matthew!
Oh, Matthew!
I must be dreaming.
Why, it's green!
I dyed it.
I can never live this down.
How often did Tom do that?
I quite frankly don't know
How do you make beef stew?
Tom and I don't talk much
How do you stay motivated?
I think I'll take that one
How far away is your farm?
How hard can it really be?
How has your life changed?
How is a new pope elected?
How is this going to work?
Tom doesn't like baseball
I'll be in Boston tomorrow
How long have I been here?
Tom doesn't try very hard
I'm hoping it won't happen
How long have you been up?
I'm not as busy as you are
How many games can we win?
I'm not as tall as you are
How many guards are there?
I didn't care what happened
How much did that cost us?
I don't put sugar in my tea
How much food do you need?
I don't really want to sing
How much sleep do you get?
Tom knew he couldn't stay
I don't think I've mellowed
How much time do you want?
I don't think we'll do that
How much will it all cost?
I don't want to sing either
How old are your kids now?
I hope you're not too angry
How realistic is the plan?
I hope you're not too upset
How tolerant should we be?
How would you handle this?
I'll miss her terrible.
Oh, you'll pass all right
Don't worry
I really don't want to sing
How's your blood pressure?
I'm not going to sing today
How badly do you want this?
I'm not sure how I did that
How big a yard do you have?
I'm not sure what we can do
How can I thank you enough?
I've really got to get home
How can anyone be so naive?
Tom isn't a university student
I didn't really want to sing
How can we let this happen?
Tom isn't going to be punished
I didn't want anybody's help
I'll miss Tom a lot
How can you criticize that?
Tom isn't sure how it happened
I didn't want to do anything
How can you sleep at night?
I'm sorry that I did it
Tom isn't sure what to believe
Tom wouldn't let go of me
I don't always sleep so well
How did you break your leg?
Tom isn't the right man for me
I didn't want to hurt her
You have to believe me, Fadil
Are you thirsty, pal?
Are you getting me?
I've had enough time to think
I really don't want a battle
Life isn't like a fairy tale
It came out negative.
I can't say the same about you
Is he coming here?
I'll take care of everything
We don't know where she is
Come on, don't look sad
Where's Fadil?
He's taking a shower.
I've probably got an ulcer
I'm done with this
What if they heard you?
I'm going to marry Fadil now
So why are you here?
Did she let you in?
I'm very tired
I don't want to do this now
Where did you park your truck?
Don't touch my truck
He's just a loser out of money
I can't marry anybody
I don't trust men anymore
I didn't get badly hurt
You don't need him
Let's not do this here
I promise you'll regret this
I've earned it without you
Sit down.
Thank you.
You can count on me, Fadil
Why is Fadil here?
Why did Fadil come here?
It's all over.
But only for the moment.
Take it easy, Fadil
So I'm free?
How's everyone doing here?
Is it ready yet?
Go through.
Where is Fadil's truck?
I'll give you a check
Why did Tom come here?
Your name is...?
Fadil Sadiq.
I'll be waiting inside
I'm sure he's coming
I don't wanna think about him
Don't mention him again
Layla is a certified nurse.
Oh, so you're one of us.
Give me the key.
I'd rather die.
You've got to tell me
I feel fine now, really
Let's go back inside
It's windy
You didn't bring flowers today
You're not wrong about that
What is it what you want?
I want answers.
I'm in a very good mood today
I promise we'll have fun
I'm really busy right now
I didn't mean to bother you
Stay away from me, Fadil
I can't believe it
She doesn't like me
I didn't say anything to Fadil
Who's gonna believe him?
I wasn't going to tell him
Is he feeling any better?
That's all I'm asking for
Are you alone now?
We've just admitted a patient
Is it open?
Fadil isn't in
Come, we'll talk outside
I'm not leaving until we talk
You're making me lose my mind
Do you understand me now?
Every word.
He'll be fine, OK?
We're not getting married
Should I call him?
Stay away from me, Tom
Where's Tom's truck?
Does he work for this company?
He's still here in your office
I'll sort this out
That's why I've asked you over
He's going to be my son-in-law
I'll take it to your office
I'll just take these
I'll be late for my classes
I didn't steal the money
Why did you bring Fadil here?
Don't give any names
No names, OK?
I wasn't even insured
Is anyone here?
Did you talk to Fadil?
What does she think?
Nothing happened, right?
I don't care what they think
Don't touch my porn
What is Fadil waiting for?
Guess where I'm calling from
I'm calling from my new office
Is he still in my office?
Why are you in my office?
I notified Mr. Sadiq
He's on his way
Yesterday doesn't matter
It doesn't matter
He's redecorating the office
Fadıl know Jet Fadıl?
Get out of my office!
What does Tom do for work?
I don't feel that way at all
How did you deal with that?
Tom isn't very strict about it
How are you related to Tom?
I don't know what they think
How did you get that price?
Tom just doesn't want to do it
How does Tom keep his cool?
I hope you'll come back soon
How did you get to do that?
How much is Tom being paid?
I hope you'll visit us again
How do you keep costs down?
How exactly does this work?
How far are we from Boston?
How many chairs do we need?
Tom just wouldn't let go of me
I think I shouldn't eat this
How much caffeine is fatal?
How much cash do you carry?
Huh?
You're flushed
Is Tom coming here?
Is that what Tom said?
Why is Tom always late?
I didn't want to hurt Tom
If I were you, I'd hit Tom
Is Tom still in his office?
I thought Tom wasn't coming
If I were you, I'd kiss Tom
Let's tell Tom what happened
What do you expect Tom to do?
Why on earth did Tom do that?
Is Tom Jackson a patient here?
I thought Tom wouldn't be here
If I were you, I'd talk to Tom
Shall I put my pearl beads on?
I don't want to think of it.
They were simply dazzling.
We've got each other, Anne.
I'm just as ambitious as ever
Nonsense!
Bless my heart!
Tom knows change won't be easy
I wasn't planning to do that
How much honey do you need?
I wish they'd leave us alone
How much is it worth today?
Tom knows he's partly to blame
I wouldn't trust anyone else
How much space do you need?
I wouldn't trust anyone here
How much will college cost?
Tom didn't want Mary leave
I'd rather not eat right now
How old is the lead singer?
I'm getting off the bus here
How would you have done it?
Tom knows what he's up against
I'm going to study all night
I'm going out
Fadil just couldn't resist
Fadil carried a 9mm pistol
Fadil endangered Layla's life
Fadil was a soulless ex-con
Is Fadil a threat to society?
Fadil didn't get very far
Fadil didn't have family there
Fadil's request was granted
Fadil used Layla's credit card
Fadil didn't get far
Fadil financed Layla's escape
Fadil used Layla's phone
Fadil reentered Layla's life
Tom attracted Mary's attention
Tom used Mary's credit card
Tom's request was granted
Tom used Mary's phone
You must've seen Tom
Are you pregnant yet?
Fadil didn't have a big belly
Fadil can't make a mistake
Fadil didn't believe his eyes
Fadil wasn't the only one
At Fadil's command, Layla shot
Fadil got kidnapped, too
Do it, Fadil
Fadil's father was alcoholic
I'm your daddy now
Fadil took Dania's money
Don't give me that gun
I don't want to do this
Fadil doesn't live alone
Fadil wasn't inside the house
It's all your fault, Fadil
I still remember Fadil's eyes
You don't seem to know Fadil
You don't know who Fadil is
Don't defend Fadil
Did you convince Fadil?
Tom doesn't live alone
It's all your fault, Tom
Tom wasn't inside the house
Has Tom been to the hospital?
I think that boy's name is Tom
Tom's father was an alcoholic
What if Fadil sees me?
Dania, go call Fadil
I don't know this Fadil
It doesn't ring a bell
Fadil didn't do anything bad
Fadil wasn't able to work
Fadil kidnapped Dania's dog
Fadil shot Dania's dog
Who are you talking to?
Me?
Fadil drove to Dania's home
Fadil wasn't a very shy boy
Fadil's mother was single
Did Fadil do something wrong?
Fadil stood by his wife, Layla
Fadil didn't see Dania
Fadil went to Dania's home
That was Fadil's first call
Fadil's double life surfaced
Fadil was quite a ladies' man
Fadil wasn't feeling secure
I'm hoping that won't happen
How am I different from you?
I'm pleased with this result
How are you doing in school?
I've probably made a mistake
How big of a problem was it?
I can't do anything by myself
How can I improve my memory?
Tom said he'd look into it
I can't wait till next Monday
How can I make some changes?
Tom likes his eggs hard-boiled
I'll be next
I'll be safe
I'll come by
I'm a banker
I'm a busboy
I'm a cowboy
I'm a dancer
I'm a father
I'm a hermit
I'm a hunter
I'm a junior
I'm a member
I'm a potter
I'm a senior
I'm a singer
I'm a smoker
I'm a surfer
I'm a waiter
I'm a writer
I'm an actor
Tom wasn't able to work today
I'm anorexic
Tom held a gun to Mary's head
I'm autistic
I'm barefoot
I'm diabetic
I'm doubtful
I'm educated
I'm grieving
I'm hesitant
I'm hurt bad
I'm literate
I'm no angel
Tom drove to Mary's home
I'm no dummy
I'm painting
I'm relieved
I'm shopping
I'm still up
I'm studying
I'm sweating
I'm thirteen
I'm tolerant
I'm still awake
I don't want to look like Tom
I say it's OK
Do you think Tom was murdered?
I'll speak to Tom about that
I can't paint as well as Tom
Tom says I'm too aggressive
I'm sure Tom will miss Mary
Tom says that I'm annoying
Tom says that I'm a grouch
I've already thanked Tom
I walked past Tom's house
I hope Tom won't be there
I impressed Tom, I think
Tom thinks I'm romantic
I can't help loving Tom
Tom says I'm obstinate
Tom says I'm obnoxious
Tom says I'm conceited
Tom says I'm strange
Tom says I'm a prude

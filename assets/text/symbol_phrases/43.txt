That's our baseball field
They're always complaining
Did you keep your promise?
Did you keep your promises?
What if they don't come?
It looks like Tom isn't alone
Do my paintings inspire you?
We're poor men
Who would know the answer?
Don't give Tom anything to eat
I'd like to come, but I can't
Does anybody ever visit you?
Does anyone ever visit you?
Let's calm down, guys

At times like this, I miss Tom
Let's meet in the lobby
Why is Tom so stubborn?
Hey girlfriend!
I'll teach you German
Who's your travel agent?
Don't you need anything?
Why didn't Tom let us do that?
Tom's smile turned mischievous
So, what's on our agenda?
Such could be magic.
Are you expecting guests?
Did it last a long time?
Where did Tom leave his key?
It'll be over tomorrow
Tom was a good-natured man
What's that strange smell?
We didn't see it coming
Where are my headphones?
Can you find me Tom's address?
I couldn't
Did you write that note?
Whose turn is it now?
You'll be able to do that
That's also an option
Why don't you want it?
Tom's piano needs to be tuned
He's a garbage human
Everybody knows it wasn't Tom
Tom drank too much, didn't he?
I don't want to ask Tom that
We're winning the match
Tom didn't send any messages
What do you have in your pack?
Where's the orphanage?
He isn't alive anymore
Where do we find ourselves?
You're lagging behind
Why is this so hot?
You won't get any help from me
It's powdered sugar

Make me a child!
Have you seen Tom since then?
Who lit the lamp?
Did you drink anything?

Did anyone meet you?
I haven't seen Tom in an hour
See what they're doing
Why?
We can't let our guard down
I'm afraid that won't help Tom
Did you get a parking ticket?
Tom is the team's top scorer
Why wouldn't they help us?
Tom says I'm his
Tom says I'm his girlfriend
That's a very strange family
It's really nice here
I ran upstairs to Tom's office
I'm sure Tom is angry with me
I ignored Tom's question
There's no way we can do that
Why's that so big?
Tom wasn't alone
Are you glad we did this?
Good job, guys
Good job, everyone
Good job, everybody
Was it really necessary?
What's in the news today?
What's in the news?
What's in the bottom drawer?
Does anyone need my help?
Do you think Tom made it up?

We'll drink to that
I don't know what to give Tom
Did you hear the dog barking?
Did you hear that dog barking?
Did you hear the cock crowing?
Did you hear a donkey braying?
That's where you're wrong!
Tom still doesn't know a lot
Would you please talk quieter?
Has anyone got an idea?
You can't do it one-handed
It can't be done one-handed
Have you taken precautions?
Have you made provisions?
I've started to respect Tom
You're not who you used to be
We're somewhat similar
You haven't once apologised
I'll let you, just this once
That's for me?
Doesn't time fly?
Admit it: you've forgotten!
Admit it: you forgot!
It had to be said!
Give me a clue, at least!
Give me a clue, at least
Say something, then!
Just don't give up
I'd like to order now
It's not yet certain
It's not definite yet
It hasn't yet been decided
Let's cooperate
What's strange about that?
Oi, sleepyhead, wake up!
Oi, daydreamer, wakey wakey!
Don't bother with it
When is Mary leaving?
When is Mary going?
When will Mary leave?
When will Mary be going?
I was tired, so I went to bed
I'd really like to thank you
How do I get to the bus stop?
He's never been abroad
Who's waiting for us?
It's the reason why I'm late
Oi!
You!
Come here!
Hey you!
Come here!
We'll soon find you a seat
Smiling, Tom took his leave
It's pretty cool there
I didn't expect much from Tom
Don't bury it too deep

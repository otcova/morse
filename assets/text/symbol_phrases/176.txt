Let's sit in the front row
Let's sit by the fireplace
How can you just sit there?
Do you mind if we sit down?
Would you mind sitting here?
Would you mind if we sit in?
Will you sit down and relax?
Why aren't you sitting down?
There's nowhere left to sit
Maybe you'd better sit down
Let's sit at the same table
Can I sit down for a minute?
Would you mind if I sat here?
Why are you sitting out here?
Where are we supposed to sit?
We'll just have to sit tight
Someone's sitting in my seat
I don't have anywhere to sit
Can I sit down there, please?
Are you going to sit with me?
You're sitting in Tom's chair
You don't have to sit with me
Why don't we all sit together?
Why are you sitting at a desk?
That's why we're sitting here
I'll be right back
Did I say you could sit there?
Are you going to sit with Tom?
We're not leaving yet
We're sitting targets here
We can't just sit here
I'd love to go there one day
Do you have any kids?
Do you pluck your eyebrows?
I'm not happy with my looks
Tell me you're joking!
My mom told me that I'm fat
I knew you had a boyfriend!
I knew you had a girlfriend!
What will happen to him?
What will happen to Tom?
She's a really nice person
He's really handsome, too
I don't care because I'm happy
It's as sure as death
Help me, Phoenix Wright!
You are my only hope.
Link is living the good life.
Don't worry
I know the prosecutor.
Miles Edgeworth.
I'm dreaming
Damn..
Are you alright?
I'll be fine
I think my heart stopped.)
Go with many blessings!
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Look at his badge.
That's a fact.
I'll return to this later
I'm taking the afternoon off
Your children are so charming!
Does your wig make you deaf?
What men don't see, God sees
It's a cannon shot, is it not?
Answer me quickly, or I'll die
It's me, he said softly
Where is Mary?
What have you done with Mary?
How!
He loves me!
Prepare to die!
Why did I not die then!
I'm not dangerous
Tom isn't dangerous
How dangerous is Tom?
What sort of danger is there?
Are we in any danger?
Is Tom in any danger?
How dangerous are they?
It's a dangerous world
It's dangerous out there
That's a dangerous curve
How could it be dangerous?
I am a crazy communist!
What dangers do we face?
Is Tom actually in danger?
Tom wasn't aware of the danger
Wait, it could be dangerous
How immediate is the danger?
It's much too dangerous here
Isn't that kind of dangerous?
What we're doing is dangerous
Nuh-uh, that's not true
Nuh-uh.
Uh-huh.
Shut up or I'll shut you up!
You won't get away this time!
Were you optimistic?
Let's be optimistic
I wasn't optimistic
Tom isn't optimistic
That's optimistic of you
Tom isn't very optimistic
Tom is optimistic, isn't he?
How can Tom be so optimistic?
You're optimistic, aren't you?
This time I'm very optimistic
That's very optimistic of you
Tom's plan didn't sound stupid
We never should've done it
Mary fast-forwarded the movie
Double-check your answers
Is it unconstitutional?
Is he alive or dead?
He's alive.
Is he alive or dead?
He's dead.
My car is a gas-hog
My car is a gas-guzzler
Let's see what you have there
You're a long way from home
I'm a long way from home
She isn't here now
Whatcha talkin' 'bout?
Aid me.
No.
Help me.
No.
Save me!
No.
Oh!
No dinner in the fridge.
Buy some.
No money.
How is your time off?
Boring.
I'm going to attack Ganon!
Link?
What's wrong with you?
You've got no boobies!
Stop looking at my boobies!
What boobies?
Father!
What did you say?!
I said you're a glutton!
Now you finally get it.
Now you've ruined it
It's obviously ruined
It'll ruin everything
Did I ruin your plans?
You're going to ruin it
Why are you ruining my life?
Now you've ruined it for me
You're ruining my whole plan
Please don't ruin this for me
I'm sorry I ruined your party
You could've ruined everything
Don't tell Tom
I'm glad you didn't tell Tom
What can we drink?
That's what you do, isn't it?
Finally, she arrived!
Finally she's here
You speak German, don't you?
Don't call me Uncle
He's a lone wolf
Why don't they talk to me?
It's his dirty little secret
It's her dirty little secret
I don't see a temple
Did you put it somewhere?
Do you see a book?
We'll be hungry
Tom's a rich kid
I'm sorry I'm late
So, what do you suggest?
There's only one day left
You've got to pay attention
When did Tom leave for Boston?
No, I have a better idea
Tom's making his bed
It was very careless of you!
He's my friend.
Where did I put my keys?
You kissed her, didn't you?
Do you like insects?
Here's the good one
We'll miss you, too
I'd like to go see a movie
I'm not your jester
Now, it's my turn to laugh
I'd like her to stop smoking
Could I do it?
Is this good enough for you?
Oh yes, that's right
I'm a bad boy
No, this isn't a chat
I don't think she will come
I don't think she'll come
I think she won't come
I think that she won't come
I still haven't paid Tom
I don't trust the television
It is a pleasure, my friend
There's a safe in Tom's office
Tell Tom I'll come back
It's evident
I'm taking the week off
You're safe with us
You're safe with me
You're safe in here
You're not safe there
You're not safe here
You're in safe hands now
You'll be safer with me
You'll be safe there
You'll be safe now
You'll be safe here with Tom
You'll be safe at home
You said I'd be safe here
When you're here, I feel safer
We're safe now, aren't we?
We're safe in here, aren't we?
We're safe here for the moment
We're safe for the moment
We're quite safe here
We're not safe here any longer
We're all back safe and sound
We'll be safe there
We'll be safe here
We'd be safe there
Tom thought he'd be safe there
Tom is safe, isn't he?
This place isn't safe anymore
This isn't a safe place
They're still not safe
They'll be safe here
There's safety in numbers
That's a safe bet
Let's talk about safety
It's perfectly safe in there
It's not safe there
It's not safe for me here
It's no longer safe here
It's in a safe place
It's a lot safer now
It'll be safer here
It isn't safe here
Is this place safe?
Is it safe to enter now?
Is it safe to eat this?
Is it safe in there?
Is it safe here?
I'm pretty sure Tom is safe
I'm glad Tom is safe
I'd rather be safe than sorry
I wasn't safe
I thought we'd be safer here
I really think we're safe here
Did Tom get back safely?
Can you guarantee our safety?
At least we'll be safe here
Are you sure that's safe?
Are you sure we're safe here?
Are you sure Tom is safe?
Are you sure it's safe?
Are you sure it's safe here?
Are we safe yet?
Are we safe now?
Are we safe in here?
Are you a feminist?
I'm very happy with the result
I'm happy with the result
The scar isn't really visible
I'm over the moon
I don't like to read Freud
He's a very nice guy
Is there any bank nearby?
Are you shy or are you scared?
I can't take my eyes off him
I can't take my eyes off Tom
I can't stop looking at him
It's a closely guarded secret
It's not on the menu
Why did you just wink at me?
Do they sell Guinness here?
Do you have Guinness?
Do you have Guinness here?
What are the five senses?
I'm able to lie to you
We've got a suspect in custody
It's not disrespect
It's disrespect
I'll show you one last time
It's kind of important.
My father doesn't let me drive
Are you his mother?
So, did he kill you?
No, he didn't, you idiot!
Do I look like a ghost to you?
Why do you want to go today?
She's dead
I didn't say careless
Don't forget your student ID
Can you save Tom?
You can't save me
That's what saved me
We've got to save Tom
We'll save you a place
Do you want to save them?
We'll save a seat for you
Save me a seat, won't you?
What are you saving up for?
You're going to need it later
Why do you hate me so much?
Maybe you can't hear me
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Why do you look so sad?
Do you want to hear the truth?
I spent it.
How do you know about that?
We can't go back there
Are we safe here?
What is your religion?
Christianity?
Judaism?
Buddhism?
The gods mock us?
Let's mock them too
I haven't slept for two days
Feed me, please
I'm so blessed!
Don't confuse me with Hitler
She's way out of my league
Who will follow our footsteps?
You didn't touch him, did you?
You didn't touch her, did you?
Is Mary an Atheist?
I think you're exaggerating
Alright, mom, I get it!
Alright, Tom, I get it!
Why is she hiding?
Who wants to go to the park?
That man is staring at you.
It's hot and stuffy in here
Why don't you help him out?
Why don't you help her out?
One point for Tom!
I'm an idiot.
No, you're not.
Do you want to come?
I'm so glad you came!
Why didn't anyone come?
You scared me!
Did I really do that?
Did I really do that?
You don't remember?
Tom's a very gregarious person
Tom's apartment is a real mess
You don't need my permission
That's much better, thanks
Why didn't you tell anyone?
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
I don't trust the tailor
My heart just melted!
I was born in Israel in 2002
I started so I'll finish
Mr. Cohen taught us math
He is cutting the boy's hair
I'm fine
And how are you?
I'm fine
And how are you doing?
Good morning, how are you?
It's probably going to rain
Where is her book?
I'm teaching them to swim
Have you heard anything?
Tom's got heaps of friends
When does the class finish?
Is that radio yours?
Do they own a computer?
He's not a man to waste time
Not another word!
I'm just an average guy
I'm just an average girl
I want something to happen.
Like what?
I don't know.
I'm so excited for you!
I'll do the dishes
They're too big for me
Who baked this cake?
It's because you're a girl
It's because you're a guy
It's because you're a girl.
That's sexist.
That would be cheating.
Who cares?
I feel like I'm in a dream
We've closed the suitcase
She waited for 10 minutes
Three baguettes, please
I'm impressed with your German
Is the snow melted already?
Are you frank and diplomatic?
How do you pronounce that?
How is that pronounced?
I'm a freelance journalist
That's not the best example
What can be said about it ?
I wouldn't say it this way
Do you have other CDs?
You're thirsty
I'm already thirsty
Is the customer always right?
You didn't look surprised
You don't look too surprised
She will return within 3 hours
How much will it cost me?
You going to Tom's party?
I don't know yet.
Tom's wasting time
Where is Cornwall?
I'm not evil
Tom isn't going to like it
Mary isn't going to like it
How was Tom's party?
You're needed at once
I'll go and see if Tom is OK
I'm here for a meeting
I'm not over thirty years old
I'm accustomed to this
I don't download them
Did you want to kill Tom?
I've got someone with me
I can't sell you that
He's a weirdo
She's a weirdo
Why is everyone crying?
Can you smell it?
Thank you for your business!
I'm sure everyone has heard it
Hello!
Where did you learn Italian?
Tom's signature is illegible
When did you marry your wife?
Oh no, I didn't do my homework
Aren't you guys sleepy?
Tom is back with his ex-wife
He's a platoon sergeant
That's absolutely correct
Would you like a coffee?
Do you know why I'm here?
Guns don't kill men
I think I'll go back to sleep
No, we don't have a map
Ok, very good
So, I think that it is open
So, something more?
That costs 30 euros
That costs how much?
That doesn't please me
The AC doesn't work
The castle, it is open today?
The heater doesn't work
The shower doesn't work
Today, it isn't raining
Tomorrow, it will be hot
Tomorrow, it will be cold
Tomorrow, it will be nice
Tomorrow, it will rain
We don't have a reservation
What can I serve you?
What can one do at night?
What cheese do you want?
What do you desire?
What on earth is that?
What will the weather be like?
Where can I buy coffee?
Where is it that I must sign?
Will that be all?
Would you like a taste?
You don't have to pay
Is the castle open today?
I'm not good with kids
Tom couldn't defend himself
Did you arrive home safely?
Tom still can't read
Did you know this, too?
Do you accept the Visa card?
Good-bye and good luck
It's a complicated matter
I brought my camera, of course
The train leaves at 3:00 p.m
Good Lord, what happened?
Let's sit down here
Do you have fire insurance?
Don't burn yourself
Careful!
Don’t burn yourself
Show me another tie, please
Let's have something to drink
It's a strange matter
Do you understand the guide?
Where should I go?
I know my student's parents
I haven't received my mail yet
It's shorter
I don't have a knife
Waiter, I need a spoon
That's the last time I saw him
What a pity that he fell!
I've been there a dozen times
Hurry up!
So, it's understood
Of course we'll go with you
Facing us, we see City Hall
We're as hungry as wolves
Don't go out
Bring me another fork, please
Some french fries, please
Don't forget your gloves
It's cold
At the crossroads, turn left
Have you ever eaten oysters?
Have you ever eaten oysters?
Never.
Visit the Luxembourg Gardens!
I haven't read it yet
Who is going to play tennis?
He slept until ten o'clock
Speak more slowly, please
Which one are you bringing?
What is the speed limit here?
Is Miss Dupont absent today?
I can't help you now
You walk quickly!
We have lunch at noon, usually
Let's go to the mountains
It's a new word for you
No, I don't like lobster
He didn't see the accident
It's very cloudy
I think it's going to rain
I need another pillow, please
Which part do you choose?
It's our turn to pay the bill
Do we have it in us?
What do you intend to do?
I think that we should leave.
He's afraid of the dog
What are you having?
It's not a serious sin
Who's going to drive?
Look at the dawn on the sea!
I am sorry, but he didn't call
I repeat, do not arrive late!
A room with bath, please
He didn't understand me
Waiter, I need a napkin
It's a serious illness
Which size do you wear?
I want a cup of coffee, please
I've never heard such a thing
Is your passport ready?
Are you from the future?
I haven't finished my work
Can you come with us?
What does this note mean?
It's all the same to him
It's a beautiful fabric
Which is your suitcase?
The market is over-saturated
He's unlikely to want to go
Tom needs a belt-lengthener
I'm from Paris, France
How much luck do I need?
They live in Helsinki, Finland
Greetings from Brazil!
Fucking heat wave!
I just haven't had the chance
I haven't told Tom anything
I don't want to go to the bank
It's a new law
It's a new day
Are you new, too?
Who's the new guy?
Is that a new tie?
Is that a new car?
How's the new job?
Who's the new girl?
Where's the new kid?
That's a new record
Is that a new shirt?
Is that a new dress?
Where's the new girl?
It's still new to me
Is that a new jacket?
Is that your new book?
Is that a new perfume?
Let's make a new start
Where's your new friend?
It's all very new to me
Are you the new teacher?
Tom's wearing a new coat
Do you like my new shoes?
What's the new guy's name?
I've got a brand new bike
Have you met the new boss?
Are you the new secretary?
Are you the new assistant?
We're under new management
Is that a new bathing suit?
That's hardly a new concept
I've turned over a new leaf
Tom didn't like the new plan
It looks like it's brand new
How do you like your new car?
Let's come up with a new plan
I'd like to try something new
They've hired some new workers
There's no new information yet
Do you want to come along?
Do you have heartburn?
It wasn't ours
Tom's crazy about sweets
It's time to say okay
Die at the club!
How is the smell?
Am I the only one?
Tom's life began falling apart
It's all the same!
It makes no difference!
I'm not greedy
Does Mary love me?
It's as clear as mud
You're going to end up dead
I am sorry, sir
We're closing early
About 20 people were injured
How disgusting!
And your parents?
When are they arriving?
It's for her mobile phone
It's going to be stormy
It's in the name of Smith
It's on every Friday at 6
It's on every evening at 8
It's on now on TF1
May I borrow a ruler?
What page?
Hey, your fly is down
They won't find him
I am young, too
Tom's a friend of his
Mary, I'm amazed
Hi, my friend!
He said what?!
He nearly killed both of them!
We're waiting for you to leave
I'm still a little afraid
It's a novel by Zola
I had to pay the bill!
It's the last time!
Gilles looks a sorry sight!
What did he do to himself?
Did you see what Robert did?
They're lively dogs
Someone's ringing the doorbell
It's no longer available
I just relaxed on the sofa!
You're silly, sometimes!
You mean George Bush?
You decide!
It's your future!
Why not ask Thierry?
Why is that road blocked?
Why is she sulking?
Why doesn't he tell them?
Why doesn't he say it to her?
Who says it isn't fixed?
Where did you put your key?
Where are we going tomorrow?
When can we sit to eat?
What's wrong?
What's important is the result
What's become of her?
What're they up to?
What's become of them?
What more could one ask for?
What is her shoe size?
What is his shoe size?
What has become of you?
What fine houses!
What does she think of it?
What did you do to yourself?
What did you do to your hair?
What did she do to her hair?
What did he say again?
What can I do for them?
What are you doing today?
I'm doing nothing much.
I'm fed up of it !
We'll settle on that
We have forgotten to sign up!
We didn't have to help you!
Show a little gratitude!
Those computers?
They're money down the drain
So, be positive!
They're not following me
They're interested in swimming
They're going to have a look
They'll wait for us to arrive
Do you want some?
They should cost about €100
They pay them €500 every week
They don't sell phone credit
They don't have raincoats?
They didn't pay attention
They did a tour of the world!
There's nothing much to buy
There's not much to visit
The phone belongs to you?
That's why I went
That's unlucky!
That smells bad!
Tell them about your holidays!
Did you get your receipt?
She's starting to annoy me
She's going to take a look
She's an only child
She'll put on less next time
She didn't tell me the truth
It's good that she did
She can't find her keys
She can say that again!
Oh, that explains everything!
Nothing much!
No, I'm waiting for my wife
My sister?
My father?
He's very active
Must I sign here?
May that be a lesson to you!
May she take that chair?
Lucie isn't here
Jean?
It's the least of my concerns
It's quite strong
It's cheap
It's been six months!
It's a pity she couldn't come
It's a complicated subject
It's 10 a.m
It won't be done
Is there a supermarket nearby?
Is that the electrician?
Is it going well?
Is it far from your place?
Is it close to the capital?
It's too late!
Think of the neighbours!
In general, we drive too fast
If you need him, call him
If I could see her, I would
I've just arrived
I've finished revising
I'm sending you a big file
I'm not fat
I'm just a little overweight
I'm in Paris for a few days
I'm going to enter my PIN
I'm convinced you'll love it
I'd like to rent a car, please
I'd like some sugar, please
He's going to pass his exams
I have news!
I have 20 euros left
I don't like beer too much
I don't know
You'll have to ask
I don't agree with him at all
I can't find the right words
Hélène has just contacted me
How much does she need?
He's had enough
Hey… did you hear the news?
He's stupid sometimes!
He's sitting beside his sister
He's promising us nothing
He's not a fool, you know!
He's going to sit here
He's going to resign
It's obvious
He'll wait for us to call him
He should revise his lessons!
He's looking for a job
He goes there at 6 p.m
He doesn't like eggs
He didn't intervene?
But why?
He didn't have time to read
He can't do everything himself
Have you seen Paul today?
Have they made progress?
Go and get the boss!
Give him back the ball!
Follow me!
Let's go into the other room
Don't worry at all
Don't touch the paintings!
Don't touch the computer
Don't forget to call Luc
Don't drink anything
Does she like chocolate?
Do you write that with a "J"?
Do you take me for an idiot?!
Do you often take photos?
Do you know why I'm sulking?
Because you're never here!
Do they sell phone credit?
Do they like wine?
Do they have their suitcases?
Do they have their suitcase?
Did they go to the mountains?
Did she look in her bag?
Did she like it?
Did he get a receipt?
Damn!
I can't find my wallet
Could you do me a favour?
Could you do him a favour?
Come back and see me!
Can you loan him some money?
Can you loan her some money?
By now, the poison has spread
Bring them back!
Avoid them completely!
Aurélie has several faults
As long ago as that?!
Are we starting soon?
Any time I see blood, I faint!
Did you cut your hair?
Why do you cry?
And your parents?
When do they arrive?
It's freezing in here!
What else do they need?
That's not our business
Why have I never been told it?
How did you meet Tom?
Would you like to take this?
Then I'm not the only one
How did you get to know Tom?
You know what else?
You'll ask Tom, won't you?
Can we speak German?
Can we speak French?
Can we speak French instead?
Could we speak French?
Could we speak French instead?
She will stay for 5 days
That's exactly what I meant
Olympic boxing champion.
Olympic running champion.
You're too particular
I'm in no particular hurry
Tom doesn't like Mary
Please don't mention it
Did Tom mention me?
Did Tom ever mention Mary?
Did I not mention that?
Did I mention that?
Did I forget to mention that?
Does she like orange?
Tom didn't understand a thing
Can they see the picture?
Excuse me, this is my seat
Say something in French.
What a waste of money!
It's a waste of money
We're all wasting time
We're just wasting time
Look, we're wasting time
It's a big waste of time
Can we stop wasting time?
We just wasted 30 minutes
It's such a waste of time
It's just a waste of time
Please don't waste my time
Why are we wasting our time?
The food didn't go to waste
Why are we wasting time here?
That's a waste of my talents
Come on, you're wasting time
You're just wasting your time
What a colossal waste of time!
There isn't a second to waste
That's an utter waste of time
This is a low-calorie muffin
Tom doesn't want justice
Tom doesn't want justice
Tom didn't want justice
He's a mean drunk
I'm the witch of the sand.
The sand witch?
Mary is John's sister
The bell rings at 8:00
It's up to you
You re-entered
I don't like his hat
I don't like her hat
Have you seen my wife?
Have you seen Mary?
Everything's hunky-dory
Do you want to see a trick?
Quiet!
May I sleep on the couch?
I know exactly what I'm doing
It's very cold this winter!
Never forget who you are!
No thanks, I'm pregnant
5,000 yuan is a lot of money
Look, honey
You can't do that!
Are there any more free spots?
This isn't completely wrong
Look!
The car is on fire!
Don't worry
I'll be fine
Can I go to bed now?
They don't want you here
I don't want them on the team
I don't want them here
You're only just in time
I'm frightfully chilly
You win!
Say something in French.
Say something like what?
Anything's fine.
There, I said something.
What, you're so boring!
Tom's a typical Englishman
Who hasn't?
Come on..
Do you like red wine?
I didn't want to throw it out
I can't eat all of this
So how's it going in Egypt?
We're doing nothing
Did I win something?
There's nothing left
Did we hit something?
Let's build something
Is it worth something?
There's nothing to see
There's nothing to say
It's nothing like that
I've got nothing to do
I found something, too
Was it something I said?
There's nothing to lose
There's nothing to fear
There's nothing in here
That's something I like
It's nothing we can use
Does Tom want something?
Did you touch something?
You'll find nothing here
Would you like something?
We've done nothing wrong
We aren't doing anything
Tom, can I say something?
There's something I want
There's something I need
There's nothing out here
There's nothing in there
There's nothing going on
It's better than nothing
I don't owe Tom anything
You've done nothing wrong
We've got nothing to lose
We've got nothing to hide
Tom's got nothing to lose
Tom's got nothing to hide
Tom didn't admit anything
There's something burning
There's nothing to report
There's nothing out there
There's nothing down here
Please say something, Tom
Let's go do something fun
It's not something I'd do
It won't cost us anything

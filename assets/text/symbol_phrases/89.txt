We're quitting our jobs
Can you go on a date with me?
Is he a feminist?
He's not a feminist
She's not a feminist
Is she a feminist?
You're going to swallow it
That isn't changing
We'll do our best to help Tom
We're looking for our cat
We aren't deaf
Tom didn't eat his fries
We haven't changed our plans
Doug, dab again and pay
I'm going to rest now
Let's play badminton
Tom didn't seem to know me
We weren't wearing our boots
Why did you say that to Mary?
That isn't the problem here
Overruled!
We've got our reasons
Tom was in high school in 2013
See you tomorrow.
Night, Tom.
I'm very fond of him
Tom's pass found John
Let's not lose any more time
Don't forget to shut the door
Want to come?
Where has he got to?
Where's he got to?
Where has he gone?
Where's he gone?
It's a very expensive country
Where has it got to?
Where's it got to?
Where has it gone?
Where's it gone?
We're having tea
We're having our tea
We're having our evening meal
He's already over seventy
That's what my hope is
Tom is in Mary's room now
Would you like some of this?
They're traffic lights
That's a set of traffic lights
Which films have you seen?
They're quite funny
They're quite entertaining
He'll go with you
What books do you like?
Which books do you like?
This item's a bargain
This summer is really hot!
It's Tom who you want to see
It's Tom whom you want to see
Tom's the one you want to see
Tom couldn't see us
I'm really tired
Of course I can, Mary
You just sit down and rest.
Will you ring him?
Will you ring him?
Will you ring him?
That isn't what I'm paid to do
She lives 500 metres from here
Can you help me push the car?
We'll get our chance
It's ten to ten
Tom could've been kinder
Tom could've been nicer
Tom could've gotten injured
I bet that I'll see Tom there
Did Tom say I wasn't coming?
That isn't an easy feat
That went right through me!
Where's the bathroom?
How can I forget about you?
Tom didn't care what happened
I'm busy right now
Can it wait for a bit?
What should I do?
That isn't how it works
Tom's plan was to wait and see
Mm, same here.
Tom's story didn't add up
I didn't know how to tell you
Isn't your throat dry Tom?
Do you want some?
No, today's my first time.
But it was tasty?
Yeah, was really nice.
That isn't all we had to do
Or...?
I wasn't that thirsty
Tom didn't do too badly
Tom didn't go back home
That isn't the important part
I hope we've proved our point
We've changed our plans
Was Tom's story true?
How did you do on the quiz?
I can't talk with you
I'm fed up with women
Tom didn't have a phone
You'll ruin the country
We didn't sell Tom our car
That isn't really my problem
Tom didn't go to jail
What are your biggest dreams?
We haven't paid our rent yet
Does Tom rely on us?
Why am I writing this?
That's not the solution
We sold our house in 2013
That isn't a bad question
That isn't much fun
How do you like it?
Who says I do?
That isn't on the list
Is it a city or a country?
I'm fed up with your children
We'll order something
We admired Tom's bravery
We admired Tom's courage
You don't have to wait for Tom
He won't come
That isn't a good thing
I'm dying to see Tom
We're going to try our best
That's not accurate, is it?
Be careful, sir
It's slippery here
What is a Google?
How long will you hide there?
I can't handle it all
We couldn't believe our ears
Tom hasn't made any progress
What division are you from?
That isn't really enough
I don't fuss over money
Ali's grandfather made wreaths
Ali's grandfather made signs
Ali's grandfather made canes
I have to see Tom.
Why?
Do you want to buy me off?
That isn't what I heard
I don't want to sell it
This kind of item won't sell
A product like this won't sell
That isn't quite big enough
That's not Tom's trombone
We'll do that our own way
You know I'm in the right
You know that I'm in the right
We'll go on our own
I'm losing my will to live
What is Tom's native language?
It's French.
Tom is from Australia.
Tom didn't expect to get fired
Why is Tom still waiting?
What's Tom still waiting for?
I don't have a native language
It's not my job to babysit you
Who will I be today?
If you're there, show yourself
I'm scared of the future
I'm not very good with words
It's so stuffy in here
Can someone open a window?
Don't listen to Tom
He's trying to trick you
It's so stuffy in here
Could someone open a window?
Did Tom trick me?
That isn't what you want to do
Why's Tom's French so good?
We're doing our homework
Tom said he hadn't seen Mary
She won't spill it
Do you often meet him?
That isn't part of the plan
Couldn't you drive faster?
That's not my intent
That's not our agreement
That's not Tom's passport
I should've obeyed
Tom told me he'd just eaten
We aren't dumb
That isn't appropriate here
What amphibians do people eat?
What mammals do people eat?
What reptiles do people eat?
What insects do people eat?
What birds do people eat?
Tom's heading this way
Mary's heading this way
Where's the railway station?
Do you have a mobile?
Have you got a mobile?
She's in the toilet
She's in the loo
He's in the toilet
He's in the loo
It's really hot this summer!
What films have you seen?
Algeria isn't a Western nation
How developed is Algeria?
How equal is Algeria?
How wealthy is Algeria?
How uneven is Algeria?
This doesn't apply to Algeria
How many Algerians own yachts?
Think about what you're doing!
What's Algeria's labor force?
Why is Morocco still poor?
Is Algeria winning?
Do you remember Algeria?
Is Chavez's dream in danger?
I'll see you in Algeria
We're proud to be Algerian
Can Algeria contain inflation?
It's not useful
Bouteflika took office in 1999
Boumediene passed away in 1978
I'm afraid to do it
Is Algeria prepared for this?
I'm sorry for snapping at you
I shouldn't have yelled
Let's suppose it's natural
Honestly, I'd rather be wrong
I'm so glad you exist
Did you go there?
I don't know how it'll end
I'd really like you to go
I'll draw water from the well
There's a draft
There's a draft
We should've arrived earlier
There's not any running water
That isn't Neptune
Have you seen Tom around?
I've been looking for him
What's Mali's ethnic makeup?
Can Morocco escape poverty?
Can Morocco overcome poverty?
Tebboune was elected in 2019
Who do you want me to bet for?
They don't miss me
Don't forget that I'm a person
Suddenly, the crying stopped
The girl wasn't there
She was gone!
Can you open this?
Who do you want me to go with?
I only caught one word.
We don't have so much time
I'll go to school at seven
Don't tell Mom
Enough with the insults!
I can't nor want to go there
Let them eat cake!
Why did we stop?
I'm tired of games
I'm not interested
Well yes, but actually no
I'm singing now
Can cats have vegan cheese?
Can cats have vegan yogurt?
Life or death?
Tom's got daddy issues
Mary's got daddy issues
I won't see her tomorrow
Do you feel it?
You aren't as fast as you said
That squirrel stole my acorn!
Let's sing a song together
Don't call me gay!
Have you ever been harassed?
You're going to Brazil
I don't know why I'm in pain
For you, I'll gladly do it
You can't smoke in my room
Sooner or later, it'll pass
Money doesn't grow on trees.
I've seen all my movies
What's wrong?
Why are they missing?
Money doesn't grow on trees.
If I were you, I'd leave
If I were you, I'd quit
Did you feel that earthquake?
That isn't my only problem
That isn't your only problem
You're a veteran, aren't you?
It's a long way from here
Where should I go next?
It's all your fault, Tom.
What?
You're a robot, aren't you?
Is Algeria really developing?
What's Algeria's total area?
Is Algeria's public debt high?
You aren't very intimidating
It's Tom, isn't it?
Actually, no; it's John.
He doesn't deserve it
Why sentences, you may ask?
Awesome, right?
Where is the student's book?
What is this woman's name?
We're not good at math
He's painting the wall white
It's not a pretty sight
Tonight, I feel like going out
Cookie!
Get out of there!
I did that last night, Tom.
It's been way too hot
Do you like going by tram?
Go home, Tatoeba
You're drunk
Has Tom slept?
I'd quit if I were you
Where is your older brother?
We didn't sell our car to Tom
Who?
What?
Where?
When?
Why?
However, he's not happy
Tom's silence surprised me
Algeria's future looks bright
Any volunteers?
Dig in, everyone
I'm helping Yanni with Berber
How protectionist is Algeria?
Yanni is just a baby.
Do insects feel pain?
Do insects have brains?
How do insects breathe?
Does this insect bite?
Does this insect sting?
Is this insect dangerous?
Can you eat insects?
I can't find the rosemary
Do insects experience pain?
Do squids experience pain?
Algeria is an ex-French colony
It's my wife's birthday
Algeria's debt has increased
Do investors trust Algeria?
Algeria's agriculture declined
Algeria's roads are well built
Algeria's GDP has increased
Algeria's population soared
Algeria's GDP has decreased
Tom couldn't eat
What's Algeria's population?
Algeria's economy slowed down
Algeria's economy stagnated
Why risk investing in Iraq?
Very progressive of you!
I didn't say it on purpose
I don't want to watch that
Tom can't do a pull-up
I'm feeling nostalgic
He won't spill it
He's not a kid anymore
She doesn't like olives
That's what everyone said
I'll need your itinerary
Where could I hide?
I looked at Tom's boot
Forget it, Tom
It's Tatoeba
Yeah, let's move on!
It wasn't me; it was God
Tom, did you feed Cookie?
I don't like waiting on tables
I think it's a fox, not a dog
That isn't what I meant to do
Tom's parents are in Australia
This isn't your book
It's mine
At the bottom.
He probably hasn't either
We don't like originality
Tom didn't want to go overseas
Tom didn't have his laptop
Why did Tom cross the road?
He wasn't wearing a seatbelt
It's miserable how he lives
Yanni found Rima's phone
Can I come in?
OK, but hurry.
Yanni didn't get very far
I'm still not sleepy
We're more than friends
We're brothers
They're reading the newspaper
It's your fault I'm crippled
I'm not a descendant of slaves
Don't throw it away
They're covered in gold
I'm learning to make databases
I'm going to buy myself a car
We'll do our very best
I don't think Tom has seen us
That isn't nearly good enough
There's Tom's bag
I'm hunting you
That isn't very elegant
Tom didn't show it to me
That isn't fair, is it?
Shut up, fascist
Shut up, fascist!
That isn't your job
I just wonder what Tom's up to
Tell Tom I'm here to see him
Tom didn't hear Mary crying
That's not Tom's bicycle
Tom isn't going to do that
At least, I hope not
That isn't my wife
We're very proud of our father
That isn't how it is
I've never met a human before
That isn't worth our time
That isn't entirely surprising
We'll do that on our own
That isn't a choice
I can't open my mailbox
Who were the Scythians?
Which of us is right?
She's helping me a lot
You're so mysterious today
She's thirty one years old
He's thirty one years old
This car isn't worth anything
We've enjoyed our stay
Where are you going?
To get a stapler.
What's wrong with this one?
It's out of staples.
Where is Monaco?
Where's Monaco?
I didn't find that funny
Is this vaccine effective?
The clothes aren't dry
Tell Tom I can't see him today
We're working on our website
I don't want to say the answer
He's pretending to be asleep
They don't know her
What is graphene?
I've been here since five
Do you still deny your guilt?
What do we need today?
The lock's broken
We didn't have our boots on
Tom doesn't recycle
That isn't easy, you know
Why's he so thin?
Why is he so thin?
Why's she so thin?
Why is she so thin?
Tom's car was totalled
We won't say anything
It's not entirely legal
It's worth it!
Tom doesn't play fair
Can I take a picture with you?
I haven't seen Tom for a year
Your neighbor's rich
Tom didn't choose me
We didn't have evidence
Well, I just hope you're right
Tom didn't hear Mary leave
Will Tom come?
No, I don't think so.
Tom didn't leave a will
We're selling our boat
Have you seen Tom's new hat?
It'll soon be lunchtime
Will Tom help us?
No, I don't think so.
Do you like punk rock?
That isn't our only problem
Tom is very, very rich
Okay, that was kind of creepy
Give me your lunch, nerd!
It's time to say goodnight
Can I turn on my playlist?
Can I put on my playlist?
Tom didn't feel sorry for Mary
Tom didn't know Mary was sad
Who taught Tom French?
Tom's French is very bad
Women aren't allowed in here
We might've missed the bus
We couldn't find our way out
Tom was still a kid in 2013
We're bored out of our minds
We could've missed the bus
I'll respond to that later
You're unbelievable!
Are you colorblind?
You're mistaken!
I'm a minimalist
She's suffocating!
Stop immediately!
He's AFK
I'm a homebody
Can I step out?
Execute him!
We're visiting our friends
Don't spam!
I'm bankrupt
Life's meaningless
Hoist the anchor!
Pull up the anchor!
I'm infected
We've promised to do our best
Do you have a buyer?
Has it been appraised?
There you were!
Is this the original version?
Is this a cover?
Tom didn't offer to help me
Tom's way out of your league
Is that a legal move?
Are you trying to upset me?
Why won't you apologize?
No, I didn't
I hate blue.
Do you want to trade?
That isn't annoying to me
We won't sell our land
I haven't tried yet
He's dying of hunger
He's eating beans
That's not French
I sure hope that you're right
At least that's what I hope
That's not Tom's idea
Hey, Mary!
Then go back and eat there.
That isn't true either
We're very proud of our team
Tom didn't bring that up
Our dog is called "Poppy
That's not a pencil
I'dn't've done it without you
That's not the actual plan
We're here with our families
Nothing's happening right
Goodbye, world
What is Alice doing?
That isn't a coincidence
That isn't saying a lot
We're trying our best here
That isn't required
That's not Tom's suitcase
We're on our way out
Tom didn't eat anything either
We've renovated our house
That isn't Tom's idea
Tom hasn't seen this
Tom didn't like Mary either
That's not a lie
Liza's yard was cleaned by us
We have cleaned up Liza's yard
We'll do our homework
That isn't what I saw
I think that it'll clear up
Here's a gun
That isn't my question
That's my hope as well
We've paid our dues
That isn't so many
It'll soon clear up
That isn't really a solution
Tom's room's a mess
That isn't soon enough
That's not Tom's only secret
Tom came to help me, not you
I looked at Tom's boots
You don't have to wait for Tom
He's not coming
That isn't too much, is it?
That isn't the real problem
We can't tell you our plans
That isn't the case anymore
I didn't see anything at first
Tom's shoes were muddy
You shouldn't go that fast
How fast are you?
Do you have any ice?
It's frozen solid
What's in it for Tom?
Where did you see it last?
They're working on the problem
I can't get through to anyone
That's a tautology
Tom's video got taken down
Tom's childhood was rough
Why did you do it, Tom?
I didn't do anything!
Your tea's getting cold
Are the cameras rolling?
Tom got away scot-free
Tom doesn't know where to sit
We're proud of our school
Tom is only on chapter 3
The car's a rental
It's a rental car
How do you open this?
How do you turn this thing on?
What kind of plug is this?
The instructions weren't clear
It's a terrible disease
I'll make it next time
I'll be there
Tom didn't see that happen
Gentlemen, why are you silent?
Is he saying such heresy?
It was just a warm-up
Tom has a partner, John
Tom went to Boston, too
Tom didn't steal Mary's stuff
That isn't much consolation
We didn't see Tom anywhere
Is that what she means?
We've done our duty
I don't know whether I like it
We couldn't find the bomb
That isn't all Tom had to do
We can't get our car started
We'll work with Tom
That isn't where I'm going
We didn't get our wish
We're investing in our future
Do you like Tom or John?
Tom didn't say goodbye
I really hope that I'm wrong
May I turn the lights off?
May I turn the light off?
That's an irksome thing
It's a misnomer
Parry, then strike
In fact, I don't like America
That isn't why I'm late
You don't have to wait for Tom
He isn't coming
It'll soon be time for lunch
Here's a gun
That isn't nice
Who does Tom rely on the most?
That isn't the way it is
We aren't good at math
It's really hot this summer
What's wrong?
Let's buy Tom this one
Tom didn't know where to sit
Do you like blueberries?
We didn't lose our tempers
We've just sold our car
The U.S. was a mistake
That isn't what we did
Yes, I'm insane
That isn't my style
Tom didn't appreciate that
We've lost our tickets
What's Yanni doing in Algeria?
He lives there.
Yanni's life is in Algeria
That isn't going to stop me
I'm not going to get fired
At least, I hope I'm not
That's not worth it
That's not Tom's main reason
He's buried in Kabylia
She's buried in Kabylia
I wasn't that hungry
Actually, I don't like America
We've lost all our money
That isn't Tom's idea
It's mine
Close the door and sit down!
I don't work as much as you do
Waiter, service, please!
My family isn't home right now
He's lost his dentures
Have a good week, darling
I'm not training you
That's not acceptable to Tom
You'd better hope no one comes
Tom didn't pay his phone bill
Let's see what Tom thinks
That isn't what it means
Tom hasn't seen this yet
Why don't we make Tom do that?
That isn't a tough decision
We'll meet him in the library
I haven't checked yet
That isn't what I want
We've had our ups and downs
There's a hole in the basket
What was he like?
Do you have hydrogen peroxide?
Don't give anyone our address
Where do you buy books?
That isn't quite it
Who are you?
Sorry, I don't remember you
Do you know history well?
We're on our way over
We're talking about time.
Tom didn't talk to me at all
That isn't how I see it
Actually, I don't like Tom
I'm not interested
The clothes aren't dry yet
That isn't what worries me
Are you trying to buy me off?
Are you trying to bribe me?
That isn't much of a plan
I'm not obsessed with money
Where do you feel you belong?
Wait here, please
We'll do our part
That isn't what I mean
That isn't the best example
Tom didn't see Mary
I'd never say no
Why are you always happy?
It'll take me all day
That's not what I want to see
That isn't what I was doing
That isn't my computer
We're already Algerian
That isn't uncommon
Do you know what couscous is?
We eat couscous.
What is couscous?
It's an Algerian couscous.
What did you eat in Algeria?
Couscous.
Do I look Algerian?
Can you cook couscous?
Sure!
Tom didn't expect Mary to cry
It's a new pair of boots
Is this their stuff?
Is it his stuff?
It's almost the same!
It's nearly the same!
It's a wolf
That's all our money
Is that all we have?
That's pretty absurd
This is unacceptable!
Get out of the way, Yanni
It's an absorbent fabric
It's an alcoholic beverage
It's a cheap monitor
It's a dangerous country
It's her third child
It's his third child
Is that a whale?
Is he afraid of them?
We didn't wait for our turn
We've changed our minds
The green umbrella is Tom's
Don't lie
That isn't my cup of tea
I'll attend to that
That isn't good for business
I'd love to go there one day
Are the doors unlocked?
Are the windows open?
Is it flammable?
Is it intact?
Are the fires still burning?
That isn't in my price range
That isn't what I said at all
We got our money's worth
We're at our wit's end
We've just lost our jobs
Tom didn't win the lottery
She's an adult
You're a great employee
You're a hard worker
Clean up after you're done
That isn't what we're about
That isn't in the file
That's a really big fish
That's a really big one
Let's make Tom do that
I sure hope so.
He's got some nerve!
I think I'm an addict
I've never killed anyone
It's not a common sight
I think the website's down
That isn't the truth
It's yours now
Cookie is a long-haired cat
Cookie is a short-haired cat
Cookie is a St. Bernard
Uranus isn't very pretty
What's your mortgage payment?
I can't afford that right now
I'm trying to pay off my loans
That isn't a big problem
That doesn't sound healthy
How much can you bench?
Do you need these papers?
I'm going to throw it out
What have you planted?
We'll be on our own
Luckily Tom didn't see me
I'll see if Tom is in
We're getting close to Boston
Do you want to do the honors?
She's thinking of going away
We're all in the same position
There's a draught
There's a draught blowing
She's mended the broken table
He's mended the broken table
Water is wet!
That's got to be a mistake
Don't worry
It'll work out
Let's go for a walk
The rain's stopped
Let's go for a walk
Who do I have to thank?
Who have I got to thank?
Fun, isn't it?
Fun?
Water is wet, but is fire dry？
Yes, Mum.
Let's swim out to the buoy
I'm in my mom's car
Is it safe to swim here?
He's dropped a real clanger
Don't swim after dark
Don't swim by yourself
Do people swim in this bay?
Don't swim in this pond
After lunch, let's go swimming
Are penguins good swimmers?
That's a lot of translations
What would Uranus smell like?
Once again, with gusto!
Are you scared of anyone?
I'm not going to get fired
At least, I hope not
Tom didn't want to date anyone
The dam was completed in 2013
That's not a tough decision
Was he always like this?
It's our anniversary tomorrow
I think she's married
Who was calling me?
What can we do for you today?
It's obvious she's not my type
I guess I'm just unmotivated
Everyone, let's stay calm
What do I have to do now, Dad?
Berg is a center-back
He was caught red-handed
She said what, exactly?
Do you own all these books?
I'm not deaf!
You don't need to shout!
Who created Google?
Can I tell you a story?
Let's go, already
It's getting late
Certain birds don't fly
Some birds can't fly
You know it's your duty
That's strange
May I see Tom?
And water really is wet.
I don't have anything to add
I can't get together tonight
Are these complimentary?
She's a vegetarian
What's normality?
That's a big elephant
Yanni explored Rima's house
Yanni didn't die
Tom didn't do a good job
Tom's socks are brown
That's Tom's business
You're being very annoying
Tom didn't look good
Tom didn't trust Mary at all
Has anyone hit on you before?
Let's retrace our steps
Are you coming over on Monday?
Tom must've seen us coming
They're not supervillains
We'll be in Boston soon
You didn't miss me, did you?
Game time is set for 2:30 p.m
What set off the smoke alarm?
That's my new assistant
They don't satisfy me at all
Say that you're between jobs
Cora's baby died last night.
Oh no, what happened?
SIDS.
No, she's a snowbird.
It's just like the old days
How'd your project go?
That's what we must build on
It's a steel building
Tom didn't seem to mind it
Tom didn't say it like that
Tom's socks are gray
I wasn't able to see Tom
I love Russia.
Who wouldn't love Russia?
“Who invited Tom?”
“Not me.”
“Did I ask?”
Did Tom visit Australia?
Tom didn't like Mary's dress
We're all expected to be there
I'm not human
I'm not a human
Don't joke like that
I don't like the sun
Boys don't cry
Don't shout over me
The stars don't lie
I'm not worthy
Please don't raise your voice

Sorry, my mind was elsewhere
Tom preferred to shop in-store
I'm an amoeba
She won't let you leave
I don't want to swim
Has the rain stopped?
Has the rain stopped?
It'll work next time
Please, take some!
Mary, come quick!
Exactly!
On a clear day, we can see Mt
Tom couldn't see anything
Tom couldn't say anything else
Why are you dragging this out?
I don't drive often
We don't trust the government
You are fucked, my friend
Man, you're a fucking dupe
I don't fully agree with you
I'm currently living in Boston
Tom is a well-informed person
May I change the channel?
I hope so.
I'm just a hindrance
I'm dyslexic
Are you dyslexic?
I'm not dumb!
I'm dyslexic
Why can't I own Canadians?
Are you nervous?
A little bit.
I'm sure this can wait
I'll knock your brains out!
I hate school!
I hate school!
I'm not going
As I walked, I read a book
Is that a bird?
We don't want you here!
Tom wasn't very energetic
Is there peace in politics?
Where is a toilet?
I'm not in a good mood either
You have no idea!
You're number one!
Where did you find this knife?
Does everyone get the plan?
Is it going to snow soon?
What language is this?
I'm not wearing any pants
Don't worry too much
It's okay
Do you ride the train to work?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher
That won't work, trust me
There's no one like you
There's nobody like you
Do you believe the legends?
He won't hurt you
She won't hurt you
Is he the one?
Nice try, sit down
It’s frosty outside
Don't forget to return my pen!
I'm cutting up an onion
And what if I say "no"?
She's no heroine
Where should I sit?
Anywhere is OK.
May I call around 2:30?
May I call at around 2:30?
Don't forget to return my pen
I'm not a penguin
We left at 6 o'clock
I can't stand to live alone
He isn't himself anymore
I can't speak French or German
It's their dog
I didn't know you were so rich
That's very dangerous
Do you speak Polish?
Is there a TV in the room?
We've discussed many topics
There's clearly a problem
Tom isn't himself anymore
We left at 2:30
Which one is easier?
Speak louder!
Hurry up!
I won't be home next Sunday
Can you guess how old I am?
I'm going to study harder
What else did he say?
You're hurt
The girl's father is a doctor
I am Tom's grandfather
What has happened to you?
I won't need any help
I'll call back a bit later
Tom is my uncle, not my father
I'll be back late
Tell Tom that I'm ready
Give me some more milk!
Let's make some more
I think Tom's cheating
He's a seasoned investigator
I don't like socializing
I don't like to socialize
I admit that I'm tired

What wrench?
The bicycle wrench.
Are you from the US?
May I use your typewriter?
Does Tom have experience?
Does Tom have any experience?
Do you feel OK today?
Today my mother died.
My son doesn't obey me
Could you send me a photo?
Could you send me a picture?
Where is the tree?
I don't have a guitar
You're annoying me!
What does he do for a living?
He didn't lock the door
Tom's car has been stolen
Of course he's innocent
Appearance isn't all
So, how's the card used?
Do you see a mountain of gold?
I don't think they're coming
Surely you must go?
He's next to her
I don't think you should
How do you say "lung"?
I can't forget it
She isn't pregnant
Everyone hates know-it-alls
You aren't Japanese
I understand!
I don't know much about Japan
Will you go to Tom's wedding?
Why are you laughing?
Sorry, I zoned out
What's the matter?
I can't find my keys.
Which ones?
My bicycle ones.
The pigs aren't in the pen
You shouldn't do that!
It's nearly half past two
I can't concentrate
You're way too drunk
He'll come with me
Will you come?
He didn't write anything
What floor?
What floor is it?
Who wrote this story?
Priests don't have wives
Become more flexible!
Ah, I think I'm gonna cry
Yeah, why?
What's 'modemism'?
Really?
Really!
Take a look!
What did you think of Tom?
He's got a nice voice.
Just a nice voice?
Really!
What is luck?
She didn't feel good
Where did you massacre them?
This wasn't Tom's idea
Oh, say your name!
When does spring begin?
Do you want to speak to Tom?
It's thanks to you
So long, pop!
You're not going to eat
He slept at his aunt's
He wasn't jumping on the bed
You're supposed to be asleep!
How is Rob?
Greetings from Cornwall!
Mars is "the Red Planet
I'm from a different planet
Not at all, I do love you!
Prove it!
He won't starve to death
I follow my mom's example
It is Jack's diamond
Could we go somewhere quiet?
Good cat!
Good dog!
That hasn't convinced me
How can I help her?
Can you speak Low German?
He won't be back tomorrow
Everyone's crying
I need a little help!
What time is the meeting?
I'm going to a meeting

Is mom going to the store?
I'm doing very well
I'm really good
Are you good?
Have you done the laundry?
Have you washed the dishes?
Don't worry, you'll like it
You're a slug with hair
You've gained weight
Tom isn't like the other boys
Would you prefer tea?
Was Tom here when we got here?
This pulao tastes great!
Do you have vegetarian pulao?
Wow!
I've been unruly in my dreams
Nothing’s wrong
You can't disguise sad eyes
What is your dream job?
Tell me your name, honey!
I'm not special
I'm just a limited edition
It's on the ground floor
Should I break up with her?
That is a circus!
I really don't need any help
Let's welcome our guests
My English is perfect!
How did you achieve that?
Are you cooking tonight?
Well, such things happen
Are you sure this is safe?
I don't like adventures
Don't, Tom!
It's awful
Do you like roller coasters?
I'm late
All right, I'll be right there
You're so fake!
Who ate all the cookies?
Wait, Tom
It's too dangerous!
Don't mess with us Russians!
Don't worry about us girls
We'll find something to do
There's no such thing as luck
That doesn't sound too hard
That doesn't look too hard
Great!
Don't let it go to your head
Did you eat yet?
They're eating sandwiches
Did you go to the shop?
Don't forget to bring a camera
Tom is a self-taught musician
You're a good driver
You're supposed to be asleep
When will we start to eat?

Here's a car
Are we starting?
Be careful, there's a car!
Who likes them?
Can we go back home?
This is Tom's turtle
You can't trust that guy
Who loves me?
Is the project working out?
How's the project going?
No reason, no reason
I don't want a present
Tom didn't write anything
What's the time in Boston now?
I might've been wrong
Would you like a beer?
Who is Miss Universe 2015?
I've finalized my work
I'm shocked to my core
Tom wouldn't admit his mistake
Here's the wine list
I don't have time to see you
Mary: "Sorry?
We didn't complain at all
I'm learning how to drive
I'll be here until next week
Tom didn't tell me to do that
Tom didn't tell me the truth
Tom didn't tell me his secret

Tom didn't like the idea
I think he's a bit depressing
Esperanto is a cool language!
Is it going to rain today?

In what way?
How's your sister?
How's your boyfriend?
That's trash
Can we recycle this?
Do animals have souls?
Guys, I'm really mad at you
He's a little crazy
What should we do about it?
I'm dripping sweat.
Are you sure his name is Tom?
Is his name really Tom?
Doctor, can I drink beer?
When will my work be finished?
I think your skirt's too short
You've changed a lot
Could you wait a moment?
That's interesting
That's interesting
That's interesting
Why would you ask that?
That's interesting
Why would you do that?

We're dead if they find us
We can't leave him like this
We can't leave her like this
We can't leave Tom like this

Is the cosmos infinite?
It's too big to fit in the car
Do you remember who I am?
How far is Boston from here?
Do you regret marrying me?
What is your native language?
I would've said something
I wouldn't count anything out
I wouldn't expect too much
I wouldn't have done it
I wouldn't hold my breath
I wouldn't rule anything out
I wouldn't rule it out
Who's going to believe that?
Don't touch my flowers
Hands off my flowers!
It's okay, Tom
It's over

Don't follow her example
At first, I was disappointed
I'm a bit anxious
That's so 2015
Why are you so hot?
Tom is my ex's ex
She's my ex's ex
Don't follow Tom's example
You'd better tell the truth
I don't know his last name
I don't know her last name
I can handle this, Tom

Today I'm staying at home
Did you set the clock?
Shut up, dumbass!
We can't take it any more!
There's a label on the jar

Are you okay?
You look very tired.
No, mom, I'm fine.
Tom, what's the matter?
Look, a snake!
Look, a squirrel!

Do you want to hear my story?
Why don't you tell us a story?
I don't want to hear a story
I want to hear a story!
Do you want me to be frank?
Do you know any ghost stories?
Ignore him, Tom
He's just jealous
Alice is Mary's dearest friend
I won't take this any longer

Wherever you go, I will go too
Are you able to play organ?
He aimed, but missed
I'm from Saudi Arabia
Fuckin' slow-ass computer
Fuck this!
I ain't doin' shit anymore
Holy crap, you're pissed off!
Why don't you just piss off?
Did you not know that?
You'd better eat!
You'd better eat something
They're so rude!
Alrighty kids!
Okay!
Does everyone understand?
I'm living the dream
Did you bring them?
Why did you bring them?
I'm sure that it'll be fun!
Um... can we join your group?
No!
Absolutely not!
If not now, when?
Bro, what's your family name?
Don't get angry at me!
Don't worry about what he said
Alaska is a U.S. state
Do you have deep sea phobia?
It's too late to apologize
It's very strange
Goodbye, Ian
Is Tom an illiteracy?
Whose is this car?
If our mother only knew!
My child, what hast thou done?
Let's get some food
She's combing her hair
Who's been keeping count?
What does this report cover?
We're counting on you, Tom
We shouldn't take it lightly
We shouldn't lose our cool
We never should've done that
We certainly should've won
Tom should've won the race
Tom should've stayed home
Tom should be fired, too
Tom isn't my boyfriend
He's my brother
Tom didn't crack any jokes
Tom crashed Mary's party
Tom can't be counted out
This shouldn't surprise anyone
This should've never happened
This should be a no-brainer
That shouldn't happen at all
That should've never happened
Shouldn't we offer to help?
Our kid can't even crawl yet
Maybe you shouldn't tempt fate
Let's sit at the counter
It shouldn't matter either way
I've always been creative
I should've thought of that
I don't think that counts
How should I handle it?
Food shouldn't look like this
Don't count Tom out yet
Can Tom be counted upon?
We didn't get dressed
He didn't even say good-bye
Tom didn't even say good-bye
What time do you eat supper?
It didn't cross my mind
Tom can't cross the border
What's your phone number?
It's 1234-5678.

When do you have to go to bed?
When does his plane take off?
What do I like to do?
Protect the environment!
I'm the one in charge
I don't understand
Could you please repeat that?
You've deceived me before
We haven't decided yet
Was there any damage?
Tom's willing to help us
There's room for debate
That's still up for debate
That's a very tough deal
That's a pretty terrible deal
That's a pretty big deal
Tell me why you're crying
Let's dance together
It's really no big deal
It's a pretty good deal
It's a pretty big deal
Is it a big deal?
I've cut out junk food
I've cried a lot
I've been crying all morning
I'm undecided at this point
I'm still undefeated
I won't be defeated
I still haven't decided yet
I don't like it when you cry
Don't cut that wire
Don't cry over spilt milk
Could you hear Tom crying?
Can you dance to this song?
Can I be your friend?
You can't move as fast as Mary
Can you pay cash?
I'm a bank employee
Hmm!!
This is good!
Tom is crying.
I know.
German, perhaps
With the crow?
That doesn't really matter
Tom doesn't deserve punishment
We're getting what we deserve
It's Tom who deserves credit
Do they deserve our sympathy?
We didn't deserve to win
I'm sure you deserved it
Does Tom deserve to die?
We don't deserve this
I've bought a gift for Tom
I'm sure that it'll be fun
We're still doing well
Where are the books?
I'm delighted about that
Was the message delivered?
Tom denied taking Mary's money
You can't depend upon that
I'm really depressed
It's hard to even describe
Is this wine good?
Antibiotics can't kill viruses
What size are you looking for?
What's your waist size?
How can we spread Esperanto?
The whole body hurts me!
Who would spread such ideas?
Tom and Mary went dog-sledding
Do you mind if I have a look?
Do you mind if we have a look?
I don't see your name here
You're getting good at this
Do you think they followed us?
When is Mom coming home?
When is Tom coming home?
When is Daddy coming home?
This hotel has free Wi-Fi
Is mail delivered on Sunday?
Tom is a well-rounded person
I know what I'm doing
I'll pick you up at seven
I don't want to die here!
What is driving her?
What is driving them?
Thanks, but I'm not interested
It's Christmas Eve tomorrow
We're not scaredy-cats
Did you hear the alarm signal?
I've know him forever
I've known her forever
Where are you going, boy?
Good night and sweet dreams!
He's running wild
Apparently, I have a fever
He's studying English
He's learning English
I don't touch them
It's cold
Are you okay?
Are you stressed?
In Haiti, he is an ambassador
How was the test?
I thought it wasn't too hard.
Shall I cut the onion?
Why don't we trade LINEs?
How was the test?
How was the test?
Do not drink so much!
It's no problem, really
Why on earth are you so kind?
Your story can't be true
This dictionary isn't useful
We forgot to buy cake!
What do you call this plate?
I'm living a lie
When will it start?
I've learned that the hard way
Sometimes love isn't enough

Has Abraham already sung?
What is this dish called?
Don't disappoint yourself!
I earn 100 euros a day
May I shake your hand?
May I bring my friends?
Can you make a copy for me?
Did you read everything?
Me!
You're really condescending
It's a design flaw
I really liked Tom's design
Who designed these uniforms?
I'll go if it's fun
Who are you calling stupid?!
Tom didn't provide any details
Tom didn't get into details
Don't skip over any details
I'm not going into details
Are there any more details?
Tom didn't go into detail
I don't have any details
I'm Armenian
Does Tom already know?
It's a pleasure
Mom, I am hungry
Mum, I am hungry
Is breakfast included?
Don't miss the opportunity
But he is still alive?
Actually, he is not the driver
I don't regret arriving late
I'm not working today
Maybe you don't, but I do
Maybe you do, but I don't
I've known Tom forever
Didn't you hear the alarm?
That's really impressive
Y'all must stay
Do you need to buy anything?
He's also just a politician
You must be joking!
I can't find my passport!
I'm British
I'm a swot
Are you afraid of insects?
Are you afraid of bugs?
Are we afraid of dying?
You simply don't understand me
I've never seen her that angry
Are you tired, sweetie?
Are you tired, darling?
Is that weapon loaded?
I said the opposite!
Let us cook dinner together!
Why all this?
Welcome home, my love!
Do you love the sea?
Where did all the people go?
The zombies are in the subway!
I swear I just saw Sasquatch!
Do you play croquet?
Are the aliens invading?
Did you see the UFO?

Do you like robotics?
Are you a polyglot?
They aren't bartenders
He isn't a fisherman
Sandy won't become a doctor
What a headache!
Did she really say that?
She really said that?
To begin with, this is a lie
Do you like porn websites?
Don't you love this place?
Marika's smile was amazing
He was a good-looking guy
She didn't receive the flowers
But which one?
He couldn't resist that
He wasn't in the mood
He really was a ladies' man
He wasn't that kind of person
It's absolutely despicable

Where's Tom?
Beats me.
Why does he hate you so much?
Why does she hate you so much?
Did you break it?
I'll show you how

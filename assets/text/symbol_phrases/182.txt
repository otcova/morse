Look at how big it is!
Oh my God!
You should stop.
I don't want to stop.
Are you going out together?
Are we going out together?
Can't you understand French?
Could you turn off the TV?
I can't be late
I can't do this now
I can't do this without you
I can't go back now
I can't go there
I can't let my father down
I can't let you take the blame
I can't order you to do this
I can't possibly accept this
I'm asking you to reconsider
I'm not a marathon runner
I'm sorry, I can't do it
I've got great news for you
Let's draw straws
We can't go out tonight
You can't go in there
Where can I find the milk?
Do you need a king?
She won't do the dishes
What are you yelling about?
What was the fight about?
What's under your bed?
What do you have in the box?
What exactly is your concern?
What did you think I'd do?
What exactly did you do?
What exactly do you do?
What are you asking me for?
What are you searching for?
What did you wish for?

What's your next move?
What's our next move?
What game are you playing now?
What am I going to do now?
What's the matter now?

Where should I park?
Who are you afraid of?
When did you get a motorcycle?
Who else is on that list?
Why is Tom being so generous?
Is the cafeteria open yet?
Is the bar open yet?
Could you turn down the TV?
Are you here with someone?
I've run out of patience
Is that a bottle opener?
Do you have any objection?
Do you know much about music?
Were you miserable?
Do you trust my judgment?
How can you still be hungry?
What do you hope to find here?
What did you hope to gain?
What do you hope to gain?
What is it you hope to find?
What do you hope to find?
Should I ask someone else?
Are you a good dancer?
Do you miss Boston?
Do you know much about art?
Who should I believe now?
I don't want to believe anyone
Those haven't been cleaned yet
It looks like you're wrong
Do you think that's wise?
That's what I can't understand
Do you think that's true?
I wouldn't think of doing that
My car wouldn't start
That didn't really make sense
I sure hope you're right
That's very reassuring
Maybe you shouldn't quit
It's not perfect
You'll have to excuse me
Is that what you'd like?
Maybe you shouldn't leave
We've been asked to leave
I couldn't help it
It's incredible, isn't it?
That's good news, isn't it?
Actually, I'm not homeless
We shouldn't even be here
We've been asked to help
Show me what you've got
Show us what you've got
That joke wasn't funny
Look what we've found
Am I being foolish?
Do you think that's fair?
I believe we've seen enough
Look at what you've done
Look what we've done
Look what you've done
Show me what you've done
What is it you're doing?
It doesn't matter what we do
I haven't changed
Actually, I'm kind of busy
I've decided to stay in Boston
You're not totally blameless
Aren't you guys done yet?
Do you guys want to walk?
Did you guys make up?
Would you guys shut up?
Did you guys see that?
Are you guys ready?
Are you guys dating now?
How did you guys meet?
Could you guys help me?
How did you guys find me?
Why did you guys leave?
How did you guys get in?
Are you guys hungry?
Where are you guys headed?
Who invited you guys?
Who do you guys work for?
How are you guys doing?
What did you guys do?
What do you guys do?
Are you guys crazy?
Are you guys close?
Where've you guys been?
Are you guys armed?
Do you guys see anything?
Do you know who's in charge?
Why are we still sitting here?
Who else could've done it?
Where were you guys today?
What's wrong with Boston?
What do you guys want to do?
That's where you're wrong
Promise me you'll do that
Why didn't you ask me?
Maybe we're both mistaken
I wouldn't trust them
I knew I'd be unhappy here
Are you saying that's true?
Are you guys still dating?
What are you guys going to do?
What are you guys planning?
Where did you guys grow up?
Were you expecting someone?
It really wasn't that hard
It's really true, isn't it?
Why is everybody here?
That's what everybody says
Are you sure that's enough?
Are you sure you're not busy?
It's good that you're here
That's what you're good at
I'm glad you're glad
What do you think you'd do?
Let me see what you've got
Look at what you've become
The rules aren't important
It's rather good, isn't it?
Could we please go home now?
Do you know who that guy is?
Are you guys having any fun?
Are you really only thirteen?
What've you guys been up to?
Have you guys seen the news?
Aren't you guys coming?
Are you guys still together?
What were you hoping to see?
What were you hoping to buy?
I haven't forgiven you
Do you know what's going on?
How do you know what's real?
What is it you're afraid of?
Why do you think I'm upset?
Call me if there's a change
That's what I would've done
Look what you've done to me
This isn't fun anymore
Make sure Tom doesn't see you
The concert hasn't started yet
We haven't found it yet
These people can't be trusted
Why are you helping Tom?
When did you guys decide this?
Are you guys sure about this?
Why do you need these?
That's my suitcase
Is that all you've got to say?
Do you think that's possible?
What's that you're working on?
Are you sure you're really OK?
Is that what you're afraid of?
That's all that's necessary
This place hasn't changed much
Have you guys lost your minds?
I haven't changed my mind
Why didn't you get married?
What're you guys doing later?
What is it you'd like to know?
This part isn't so bad, is it?
How do you think they'd do it?
Do you think you're up to it?
It'll cost $300 to fix it
Who does that guy think he is?
I guess that's impossible
Now that's not a bad idea
Are you sure you're not hurt?
What is it you're looking for?
What're you guys looking for?
That's what I should've done
Do you know what you've done?
We both know what you're doing
Keep doing what you're doing
What've you guys been doing?
It's the right thing to do
Call me if there's any change
Do you think there's a chance?
My whole family's from Boston
What are you guys looking at?
Have you fixed the thermostat?
That's a great story
That's the only logical choice
I haven't got it yet
I'd like a little more time
My wife didn't die
My husband didn't die
I'll watch television
Are you hungry?
I'm always hungry.
Will we be safe here?
Why did you do that?
I don't know.
They're not roommates
They're lovers
They're not just roommates
They're also lovers
They're not just roommates
They're lovers
Come on, it's my birthday!
No, thank you
I don't want any more cake
Why are you taking pictures?
You look like a tourist.
But I am a tourist!
I've had a good day so far
Tom's party was boring
Do you remember anything else?
You didn't mean it, did you?
He just doesn't get it
I've had it with him
I can't believe it
I'm so sorry for your loss
How disgusting!
Where's my elephant?
Tom's past caught up with him
You are bad!
Cockroach!
You owe me big-time
Don't worry
Is this a joke?
Of course it's a joke!
Does this thing actually work?
Love is God's nature in action

It's just a flesh wound
What's it really worth?
The situation's getting worse
It's not getting worse
That's the way it works
That's not how it works

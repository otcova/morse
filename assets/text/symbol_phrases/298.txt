I’m fine
And you?
I'm great!
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm 31 years old
Could you write that down?
Is she single?
Do you have this in small?
Do you have this in large?
Do you have this in medium?
Do I need a seat reservation?
Could I see the menu, please?
That was delicious!
Let’s have another!
What is the entrance fee?
What is that building?
What is fun to do around here?
Greetings, sire
Do you dig it?
Don't be afraid
It'll only hurt for a second
What's the entrance fee?
Were you bit by a piranha?
A piranha is not a pet, Tom
She's trying
You do too much K, Tom
In Brazil, voting is mandatory
Are you single?
Yes.
Can you speak Russian?
What does he think of me now?
That's why I hired him
I think he's a science teacher
Don't sound so surprised
He can't even play the violin
Now I've got two
I know Tom isn't a vegetarian
That's why I hired him
Tom doesn't hate Mary
I think he's a science teacher
Tom doesn't hate Mary
I think that he's the catcher
He can't even play the violin
Why don't you just show it?
He's just a junior
I just didn't know how bad
I think he's the catcher
I know Tom isn't the pitcher
I think that he's the catcher
That's why I hired him
He's just a junior
I just didn't know how bad
It's OK if you're late
I know Tom isn't the pitcher
I think he's the catcher
I wonder if Mary can, too
That's why I hired him
I wonder if Mary went, too
He's a teacher
It's OK if you're late
I don't want this
He's much younger than Mary is
I don't want this
He's a teacher
He's much younger than Mary
That's all we know
You can do that, Tom
You can do it, Tom
Tom doesn't pay us
Tom doesn't pay us
I know that you're upset
Hi, my name is Tom
What is yours?
Hi, my name's Tom
What's yours?
You know that I don't eat meat
You know that I didn't mean it
You know that I didn't do that
You can come, too, if you want
We're not ready to go home yet
We know that you're not stupid
We know that you're interested
We know that you can't do that
We know that you aren't stupid
We know that Tom won't do that
We know that Tom can't do that
We both know that that's a lie
We aren't ready to go home yet
We all know Tom didn't do that
Tom told me Mary wasn't hungry
Tom thought that you'd do that
Tom said that we're in trouble
Tom said he'd give Mary a book
Tom said he doesn't feel tired
Tom knew Mary wasn't a teacher
Tom isn't very good at bowling
Tom doesn't know you were here
Tom doesn't know Mary likes me
Tom doesn't know Mary is upset
Tom doesn't know Mary hates me
Tom didn't know Mary loved him
Tom didn't know Mary had a dog
Tom didn't eat as much as Mary
Tom couldn't get off his socks
Tom couldn't get his socks off
Tom can't draw as well as Mary
Tom can come, too, if he wants
This pair of shoes cost me $30
Promise me you won't freak out
Nobody will know that I'm here
No one will know that I'm here
Mary knew she was good-looking
I'm sure that Tom will be back
I won't throw rocks at anybody
I thought you wouldn't show up
I know you're richer than I am
I know you're eager to do that
I know you don't often do that
I know you can't do that today
I know that you're on vacation
I know that you're not serious
I know that you'll love Boston
I know that you'll get the job
I know that you don't trust us
I know that you don't know Tom
I know that you can't stop Tom
I know that you aren't serious
I know that they're both happy
I know that Tom isn't a surfer
I know that Tom isn't a senior
I know that Tom isn't a member
I know that Tom isn't a genius
I know that Tom isn't a coward
I know that Tom isn't a barber
I know that Tom does that, too
I know that I've said too much
I know that I'm in trouble now
I know that I'm a good fighter
I know that I don't deserve it
I know Tom wouldn't enjoy that
I know Tom won't do that today
I know Tom won't do that again
I know Tom won't be doing that
I know Tom should've done that
I know Tom isn't very creative
I know Tom isn't happy, either
I know Tom isn't afraid of you

I know Tom can't do that today
I knew that Tom wasn't kidding
I knew that Tom wasn't a bully
I knew Tom wasn't a lieutenant
I knew Tom wasn't a bad person
I knew Tom wasn't a bad golfer
I doubt we'll be able prove it
I doubt I'll finish this today
I don't think that I hurt Mary
I don't think Tom noticed that
I didn't throw rocks at anyone
I didn't know that you kept it
I didn't know that I'd be late
I didn't know that I'd be back
I didn't know Tom wasn't happy
I didn't know Tom had children
I didn't know Tom could see me
I can guarantee that'll happen
I can do things that Tom can't
I bought this umbrella for $30
Everyone knows that we're rich
Don't forget Tom is my brother
You know that I won't do that
Why did Tom give that to Mary?
We know that you're very rich
We know that you're the thief
We know that you're one of us
We both know it's no big deal
We all know that you're smart
We all know Tom can't do that
Tom, I know that you're there
Tom thinks that I'm his enemy
Tom said he wouldn't hit Mary
Tom isn't able to ride a bike
Tom is better-looking than me
Tom doesn't know that I exist
Tom does what he's told to do
Tom didn't watch TV yesterday
Tom couldn't save Mary's life
Tom can see things Mary can't
Tom can eat things Mary can't
Tom can buy things Mary can't
There's no proof Tom did that
People tell me that I'm nosey
Nobody knew Tom was an ex-con
No one knew Tom was an ex-con
Mary knows she's good-looking
Mary isn't as pretty as Alice
I've been told that I'm a pig
I won't throw rocks at anyone
I wish I hadn't said anything
I think we're about done here
I really think that'll happen
I need to know that you're OK
I know you aren't comfortable
I know that you've helped Tom
I know that you're very brave
I know that you're quite busy
I know that you're not stupid
I know that you're not scared
I know that you're interested
I know that you're in trouble
I know that you're frustrated
I know that you're back there
I know that you'll enjoy this
I know that you don't love me
I know that you can't do that
I know that you aren't scared
I know that they're both busy
I know that Tom won't give up
I know that Tom isn't a rebel
I know that Tom isn't a rabbi
I know that Tom isn't a bully
I know that I've let you down
I know that I've been lied to
I know that I'm being watched
I know that I'm being selfish
I know that I'm alone on this
I know that I didn't cause it
I know Tom would've done that
I know Tom won't like it here
I know Tom won't do that here
I know Tom might've done that
I know Tom isn't afraid of me
I know Tom isn't a normal guy
I know Tom isn't a hockey fan
I know Tom isn't a good coach
I know Tom isn't a fast eater
I know Tom isn't a bad singer
I know Tom isn't a bad person
I know Tom isn't a bad driver
I know Tom is doing that, too
I know Tom could've done that
I knew Tom wasn't really sick
I knew Tom wasn't really busy
I knew Tom wasn't a bartender
I hope Tom wasn't lying to us
I don't think this is the end
I do know that it's not right
I do know that it isn't right
I didn't see or hear anything
I didn't know that you'd come
I didn't know that you cooked
I didn't know that I was hurt
I didn't know Tom was in town
I didn't know Tom was a vegan
I didn't know Tom owned a gun
I could tell Tom wasn't happy
I can't come in to work today
I bought this camera for $300
I believe that that'll happen
Everyone knows that I'm broke
Everybody knows you're a liar
Don't you think that I'm cute?
Doing nothing isn't an option
Does anybody know you're here?
Does Tom know Mary can't swim?
Do you think that I'm strange?
Do they know that you're here?
Didn't you know Tom had a son?
Did you think I was too noisy?
Did you know Tom was Canadian?
Did you know Tom quit his job?
You know that I didn't do it
Why did you give that to Tom?
Why did Tom give that to you?
Who else knows that I'm here?
What do you recommend we eat?
We know that you're in there
We aren't as young as Tom is
We all know nobody's perfect
We all know no one's perfect
Tom won't know that I'm here
Tom won't admit he was wrong
Tom will, of course, be late
Tom says Mary isn't his type
Tom promised he'd come again
Tom lived to be ninety-seven
Tom knows that he's handsome
Tom knew he was good-looking
Tom is afraid that'll happen
Tom didn't eat as much as me
Tom claims he's seen a ghost
Tom can't draw as well as me
Tom can do things Mary can't
Tom bought a camera for $300
That'll be hard for me to do
People tell me that I'm nosy
Nobody knows we're my cousin
Nobody knows that we're here
No one knows we're my cousin
No one knows that we're here
Let's hope that you're cured
I've been told that I'm rude
I'm sure that Tom knows that
I'm looking for the restroom
I'm afraid that might happen
I realized Tom wasn't joking
I know you're a good teacher
I know you'd hate doing that
I know you aren't doing that
I know that you've helped us
I know that you've got a gun
I know that you're still mad
I know that you're skeptical
I know that you're not lying
I know that you're not happy
I know that you're listening
I know that you're irritated
I know that you're here, Tom
I know that you're busy, too
I know that you're busy, Tom
I know that you aren't lying
I know that you aren't happy
I know that Tom isn't a fool
I know that I'm not dreaming
I know that I'm going to die
I know that I'm a bad dancer
I know that I'll feel better
I know now Tom wasn't joking
I know Tom won't wait for me
I know Tom won't lie to Mary
I know Tom will do that, too
I know Tom wasn't very lucky
I know Tom said he'd do that
I know Tom must've done that
I know Tom isn't a good boss
I know Tom isn't a cat lover
I know Tom isn't a bartender
I know Tom is a teacher, too
I know Tom is a student, too
I know Tom is a stand-up guy
I know Tom doesn't often win
I know Tom doesn't like that
I know Tom doesn't like cats
I know Tom doesn't like Mary
I knew that that wasn't true
I knew Tom wasn't against it
I knew Tom wasn't a bachelor
I hope you're getting better
I hope I don't botch the job
I didn't know Tom could swim
I also know Tom isn't stupid
How did you know I'd do that?
How did you know I liked Tom?
Everyone knows you're a liar
Everybody knows you're lying
You know that Tom can't win
You know that I'm different
You know that I don't dance
You know I'd never hurt you
What do you recommend we do?
We know your name isn't Tom
We know that you're in pain
We know that you're in here
We aren't as rich as Tom is
We aren't as busy as Tom is
Tom, of course, didn't come
Tom's mother is very strict
Tom said he didn't hit Mary
Tom knows he's good-looking
Tom eats when he's stressed
Tom doesn't know I'm hungry
Tom doesn't know I hate him
Tom didn't deny he did that
Tom couldn't find his phone
Tom bought himself one, too
Tom admitted he'd done that
Mary knows she's attractive
I've got to leave on Monday
I'm sure that Tom will call
I'm really angry about that
I'm not sure that'll happen
I'm happy you could do that
I'll be thirty this October
I'll ask Tom to buy us that
I think that that'll happen
I realize Tom wasn't joking
I only know Tom isn't happy
I know you're afraid of Tom
I know that you're talented
I know that you're innocent
I know that you're in there

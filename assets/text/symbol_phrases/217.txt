Tom could've been offended
Tom could've been mistaken
Tom couldn't have done that
Tom can't blame this on us
Things could've been worse
That's why we need changes
That's what Tom would want
That's out of your control
That's our biggest concern
That's all they care about
That's a very real concern
That's a huge cost savings
That'll happen to you, too
That just wouldn't be fair
Speaking French isn't easy
It's unclear when Tom died
It's hard to change people
It's going to be corrected
It's certainly challenging
It cost 30 million dollars
I've since changed my mind
I'm glad you contacted Tom
I'm enjoying the challenge
I'll buy an iPhone instead
I wouldn't say it that way
I never would've done that
I miss my mother's cooking
I just couldn't believe it
I haven't attempted it yet
I don't think that's legal
I don't consider this safe
I don't believe I know Tom
I didn't really believe it
I couldn't get warm enough
I couldn't catch my breath
I couldn't be more pleased
I couldn't be more excited
How could things get worse?
How could that ever happen?
How could anyone forget it?
French isn't hard to learn
Don't pay attention to Tom
Don't make an enemy of Tom
Don't let your dog bite me
Don't let Tom talk to Mary
Don't let Tom say anything
Don't let Tom hurt himself
Do you often hear from Tom?
Do you ever give Tom money?
Did you tell Tom the truth?
Can you explain it briefly?
Are you ready to celebrate?
Are you a Canadian citizen?
You should've taken notes
Would you say that's true?
Would you bet against Tom?
Would that have been hard?
Why would Tom be offended?
Who would risk doing that?
Where will you be tonight?
What would the others say?
What song was Tom singing?
What crime did Tom commit?
We're up to the challenge
We're a very close family
We'll be back before dark
Tom's house is really big
Tom won't be disappointed
Tom wasn't born in Boston
Tom says he'll correct it
Tom said he couldn't wait
Tom isn't allowed in here
Tom is from Boston, right?
Tom hasn't bought one yet
Tom has a car, doesn't he?
Tom doesn't seem too sure
Tom doesn't seem so smart
Tom doesn't look so tough
Tom doesn't look so happy
Tom doesn't like swimming
Tom doesn't like gambling
Tom doesn't have to study
Tom doesn't have to speak
Tom doesn't have to leave
Tom doesn't have to hurry
Tom doesn't have the time
Tom doesn't have any kids
Tom doesn't care, does he?
Tom didn't sound too sure
Tom didn't seem very sure
Tom didn't seem surprised
Tom didn't seem convinced
Tom didn't see what I saw
Tom didn't look very good
Tom didn't look very busy
Tom didn't look surprised
Tom didn't keep my secret
Tom didn't help me at all
Tom didn't have any proof
Tom didn't eat much lunch
Tom didn't catch the ball
Tom could've talked to me
Tom could've stayed quiet
Tom could've hurt himself
Tom could've come with me
Tom could've been the one
Tom can't make me do that
Tom can't do that anymore
Tom can't dance very well
They could've done better
There's a lot to consider
The back door's wide open
That's what we usually do
That's what Tom would say
That's the change we need
That's all I can remember
That would've worked, too
That doesn't belong to me
Of course, you're correct
Let's continue to do this
Let's continue doing this
It's wonderful to be back
It's unclear how Tom died
It's time we changed that
It's just a little bruise
It's easy to get confused
It really isn't a concern
Is Tom partially to blame?
I've never heard Tom sing
I'm not going to complain
I'm going to correct this
I'm concerned for my kids
I'll take the whole blame
I'll be completely honest
I think this isn't enough
I still didn't believe it
I really don't believe so
I just don't believe that
I heard it hasn't changed
I don't want Tom to worry
I don't think I'd do that
I don't often drive a van
I don't even care anymore
I don't care who they are
I do believe you're wrong
I discovered Tom's secret
I didn't consult with Tom
I couldn't help but watch
I believe that's possible
How often do you call Tom?
How could anyone hate Tom?
Even Tom couldn't do that
Don't tell Tom the answer
Don't let Tom get near me
Don't let Tom fall asleep
Don't let Tom do it alone
Don't drink the tap water
Don't be afraid of change
Could you let the dog out?
Could it have been murder?
Could Tom have been saved?
Can I leave Tom a message?
Are you really in control?
You've got to avoid that
You're partially correct
You could've taken notes
Would you please help us?
Would anyone like a beer?
Won't Tom ever come back?
Why wouldn't it work now?
Why would people do this?
Why would Tom be worried?
Why should Tom even care?
Why is it so complicated?
Why hasn't Tom called me?
Why are they complaining?
Who could've foreseen it?
Who could that have been?
Who cares what Tom wears?
When did they build that?
What's Tom's wife's name?
What else could you want?
What could Tom have done?
We're going back to work
We're checking into that
We just don't believe it
We just couldn't do that
We can't do that anymore
We can't be sure of that
Tom's house is very nice
Tom wouldn't stop crying
Tom wouldn't let me quit
Tom won't be here today
Tom won't be coming back
Tom told me he'd do that
Tom told me he'd be late
Tom should've trusted me
Tom isn't under contract
Tom isn't serious, is he?
Tom isn't really my type
Tom isn't ready for this
Tom is a member, I think
Tom hasn't had lunch yet
Tom hasn't been paid yet
Tom has a one-track mind
Tom doesn't wear a watch
Tom doesn't sound scared
Tom doesn't seem so busy
Tom doesn't need to wait
Tom doesn't need to come
Tom doesn't look so busy
Tom doesn't have to talk
Tom doesn't have to stay
Tom doesn't have to hide
Tom doesn't have to help
Tom doesn't have to come
Tom doesn't even know me
Tom didn't seem too sure
Tom didn't seem relieved
Tom didn't say much more
Tom didn't make it clear
Tom didn't have to leave
Tom didn't have to hurry
Tom didn't have the time
Tom didn't get to choose
Tom didn't eat very much
Tom didn't do it, did he?
Tom didn't call the cops
Tom didn't break the law
Tom couldn't explain why
Tom could've walked away
Tom could've been faster
Tom claims he's innocent
Tom can't have this back
They're completely wrong
That's totally incorrect
No one would've listened
It's worth a closer look
It's time to change that
It's not going to change
It'll be a fun challenge
It'll be a big challenge
I've never cared for Tom
I've decided to call Tom
I'm not overly concerned
I'm not concerned at all
I'm not Tom's girlfriend
I'm also learning French
I'll buy the first round
I'd like to clarify that
I wish I could've helped
I think that's a concern
I knew that we'd be late
I followed Tom's example
I don't think I know Tom
I don't believe in karma
I didn't complain at all
I couldn't do that again
I couldn't be more proud
I could've been mistaken
How would that be better?
How will you change this?
How have you been coping?
How could they forget us?
How could anyone do that?
How bad could things get?
Have you called a doctor?
French isn't easy for me
Everyone knows I'm broke
Don't tell Tom the truth
Don't let Tom use my car
Don't let Tom touch this
Don't bother to call Tom
Do you have any concerns?
Do you eat a lot of fish?
Did you consult with Tom?
Can art change the world?
Are you ready to compete?
Are you done complaining?
All that changed in 2013
Would that be all right?
Why would you leave now?
Why is Tom holding back?
Why didn't you buy that?
Who would want this job?
Who says change is good?
Who cares where Tom was?
Were you born in Boston?
We're not convinced yet
We'll be back next year
We could've done better
Tom's help isn't needed
Tom would've won easily
Tom would've loved this
Tom would've loved that
Tom would've helped you
Tom would've been great
Tom won't be interested
Tom isn't as tall as me
Tom has no self-control
Tom doesn't work for me
Tom doesn't have to pay
Tom doesn't frighten me
Tom didn't want to sing
Tom didn't seem so busy
Tom didn't seem certain
Tom didn't miss the bus
Tom didn't miss a thing
Tom didn't have to stay
Tom didn't have to hide
Tom didn't have to come
Tom didn't deserve that
Tom couldn't explain it
Tom could've invited me
Tom can't make me leave
Tom can drive, can't he?
Tom called 911 for help
This can't last forever
They're speaking French
The game begins at 2:30
That's how it all began
That's how I was raised
That's clearly not true
That just wouldn't work
That doesn't concern us
Let's try something new
It's something Tom made
It's a change for the worse
It won't change a thing
I'm just happy I'm back
I'm glad Tom got caught
I'll try to contact Tom
I'd like to change that
I would've enjoyed that
I just couldn't do that
I don't care what it is
I don't believe in that
I couldn't sleep at all
I couldn't deal with it
How would you change it?
How much will this cost?
How much will that cost?
How have things changed?
How could you forget it?
How could we improve it?
How could they be wrong?
Have you seen Tom dance?
Don't tell Tom about it
Don't open that box yet
Don't let Tom take this
Don't let Tom stay here
Don't let Tom read this
Don't let Tom call Mary
Don't call Tom an idiot
Don't believe any of it
Don't be so hard on Tom
Does this belong to Tom?
Does Tom want to see it?
Do you want to continue?
Do you still read books?
Do you have any concern?
Did Tom change anything?
Can you get Tom to help?
Why would they do this?
Why should anyone care?
Who cares what Tom did?
When will Tom get home?
What would the cost be?
What else could happen?
What caused the floods?
We're bound to get wet
We'll get back to that
Tom, what would you do?
Tom's answer was wrong
Tom's answer was right
Tom's French isn't bad
Tom isn't making sense
Tom is afraid, I think
Tom hasn't started yet
Tom has a kid, I think
Tom doesn't talk a lot
Tom doesn't need money
Tom doesn't impress me
Tom doesn't have to go
Tom didn't have to pay
Tom didn't have to lie
Tom didn't have a plan
Tom didn't frighten me
Tom could've warned me
Tom could've been hurt
Tom can't ride a horse
Tom can't go right now
Tom can't come in here
That's what I would do
That umbrella is Tom's
Is this a real concern?
Is anybody watching us?
I've locked myself out
I'm not taking the bet
I'm not a happy camper
I'm a little concerned
I'll phone Tom tonight
I'll change it for you
I'd like something new
I don't cook every day
I couldn't get it done
I could've done better
How long would it take?
How hard could that be?
How do you change that?
How could I have known?
How close is too close?
How can we change that?
French isn't difficult
Don't let Tom watch TV
Don't let Tom sit here
Don't let Tom hit Mary
Does Tom have children?
Do you still trust Tom?
Do you see much of Tom?
Do you often come here?
Did you visit the camp?
Did you ever catch Tom?
Did you attend Harvard?
Could Tom have done it?
Why would that happen?
Why is change so hard?
Why is Tom blaming us?
What more could we do?
What have you brought?
We could've done more
Tom wouldn't complain
Tom would've loved it
Tom won't go, will he?
Tom won't be arrested
Tom isn't replaceable
Tom isn't even trying
Tom isn't dressed yet
Tom has a plan, right?
Tom doesn't play golf
Tom doesn't need this
Tom doesn't need that
Tom doesn't miss much
Tom doesn't have time
Tom doesn't even care
Tom didn't impress me
Tom didn't have to go
Tom could've run away
Tom can't go home yet
Tom can't go home now
Tom can't afford this
That isn't my concern
May I speak in French?
It's causing problems
I'm coming right over
I'll come back Monday
I'll be back tomorrow
I'd rather go camping
I won't tolerate this
I don't really buy it
I don't care who wins
I could've stopped it
How do you buy silver?
How do we change this?
Hey, give Tom a break
Don't press your luck
Don't make fun of Tom
Don't lose confidence
Don't let the dog out
Don't let Tom hit you
Don't let Tom do that
Do you meet Tom often?
Did you call a doctor?
Would it be worth it?
Would $300 be enough?
Why don't you buy it?
Who am I to complain?
When can I come over?
What else would I do?
We couldn't find Tom
We can't get a break
Tom wouldn't do this
Tom won't understand
Tom wasn't consulted
Tom should come, too
Tom isn't fooling me
Tom isn't being fair
Tom is double-parked
Tom has a job, right?
Tom doesn't scare me
Tom didn't invite me
Tom could've told me
Tom could've said no
Tom could've drowned
Tom could've changed
Tom can't retire yet
Tom can't resign now
Tom can't just leave
Tom can't go with us
Let's go to the park
It's only just begun
I'm happy to be back
I'd rather be skiing
I'd buy one of those
I wouldn't mind that
I couldn't leave Tom
How soon is too soon?
How long is too long?
How fast is too fast?
How deep is too deep?
How could we not win?
How could Tom say no?
Has the sun come out?
Don't let Tom escape
Don't disappoint Tom
Don't call Tom names
Do you see Tom often?
Are you angry at Tom?
Why are you waiting?
Where is Tom's wife?
Where can I buy one?
Tom won't need this
Tom won't need that
Tom isn't a student
Tom doesn't need us
Tom doesn't need me
Tom doesn't need it
Tom didn't scare me
Tom didn't even try
Tom didn't break it
Tom can't leave yet
Tom can't just quit
Tom can't have this
Tom can't have that
Tom can't drive yet
Tom can't defeat me
Is it a good change?
I'll keep it secret
How has Tom changed?
Don't listen to Tom
Didn't you tell Tom?
Who would buy this?
Tom's door is open
Tom won't be fired
Tom won't be alone
Tom isn't watching
Tom isn't finished
Tom isn't busy now
Tom didn't have it
Tom didn't fool us
Tom didn't find it
Tom can't use this
Tom can't use that
Tom can't trick me
Tom can't quit now
Is your room clean?
Is this book Tom's?
Is Tom a good cook?
I'll try to change
I'll clean that up
How can we do this?
Don't let Tom swim
Don't let Tom down
Don't call Tom now
Did you lie to Tom?
Did you invite Tom?
Who did Tom marry?
Tom won't survive
Tom won't succeed
This is Tom's pen
I couldn't fix it
How would I do it?
How can I do that?
Don't wake Tom up
Don't rely on Tom
Don't deceive Tom
Tom can't say no
Tom can't go yet
Don't insult Tom
How tall is Tom?
Don't shoot Tom
Don't hurt Tom
Tom won't win
Tom can't go
Is Tom tall?
When will you take a bath?
Why are you so thin?
A few more, and it's done
I love this man!
Do you eat that?
What lovely legs!
It's downright ludicrous
Which ones?
Which one?
I'm going to change clothes
Have I convinced you?
Can I join?
Can I continue?
Should I comb your hair?
Who the hell is Tom?
I don't recall that name
May I know your name again?
I don't use Facebook anymore
What's making that noise?
Why would Tom want to help me?
Are there any risks?
I've got something of yours
Living isn't easy
I'm blind, not deaf
How can I help?
I haven't the slightest.
You know, it was miserable
Besides that, it was fine.
Tom isn't in the hospital
I'd rather stay home and knit
I miss Tom's cooking
That's why you're still single
Tom's mouth dropped open
I thought you'd love it
You won't be ready
'Ppreciate it!
Will you stop teasing me?
Well, now you know
Are you bored right now?
I can't do all of this
That wasn't very romantic
Mine doesn't either.
He's a dishonest salesperson
I'm going, too
I'm Natsuko
Let's listen to her story
You can't read too many books
I didn't talk about him
One can't earn too much money
I'm not going to go there
It's coming right at me!
It's coming right at us!
Oh my God!
It's coming right at us!
Watch out!
He's coming right at you!
I don't like Christmas anymore
Tom's children are sick
That's a secret
I can't tell you
Say the truth !
It's just that I don't like it
No, not that one!
No, not this one!
No, not that one yonder!
If you said so!
Do you know how to do it?
Is that really true!
Is that for real!
Holy heavens!
How do you put up with it?
Living here isn't easy
I'm getting fed up with SJWs
When all else fails, use fire
Is their language difficult?
What's the matter with you?
Are you nuts?
How did her son die?
That wasn't exactly romantic
Uhuh, you do not believe it?
There's a cat on the desk
You should've come sooner
We've run out of milk
Why is my code not working?
No, I don't know him
I don't want to get up!
I don't want to go to class!
I'm proud of my daughter
I don't want to go to school!
I don't want to go to work!
Do you like it?
I don't feel good now
I don't think that's right
Please, let me explain
She doesn't like fish
What is Tom's shoe size?
Do you speak French?
No.
Close that door!
Don't do it reluctantly
Did you give him my message?
Let's play a game!
They won't be able to stop you
When did you retire?
I came; I saw; I conquered
They'll understand us
Not a bad picture!
Do you like Asians?
Do you like Europeans?
Do you like Africans?
Do you like North Americans?
Tom, get out of this body!
I'll stay home tomorrow
Don't run so fast!
Do you like South Americans?
Do you like Latinos?
I won't try to kill that thing
Have you seen my feather?
Is this your obsession?
I don't like queuing
Tom doesn't like to fly
Tom didn't even read it
Tom works on Sundays, too
Tom won't forget this
Is Tom dating someone?
What else did you throw away?
I've already eaten my lunch
I don't want to go to class
We're back from Australia
Let's sing some old songs
Can you touch the ceiling?
I don't want to get up
What else did you say?
You're out of danger
Tom said he's been here before
Why did Tom lie about his age?
Tom isn't a bus driver, is he?
Tom got back home before 2:30
Tom can't afford to buy a car
I didn't believe Tom at first
Tom made it, but Mary didn't
Tom is afraid he'll get lost
Tom got home at exactly 2:30
Tom didn't notice the change
Tom couldn't start the motor
Is Tom really that clueless?
Did you give Tom my message?
Tom can't play the guitar
Someone stole Tom's money
Tom didn't give it to me
Tom won't pass the test
She's Thai
He's Thai
She's Japanese
She's Chinese
He's Chinese
She's Argentinian
He's Argentinian
She's Ukrainian
He's Ukrainian
Work fast, eat slow
Why are we laughing?
Please!!
I need a pub!
Give!
Giiive!!!
I'm dying of laughter!
I'm from France, and you?
You have legs, you go
Good morning, baby!
Did you sleep well?
How big is the company?
I'll wait here for you then.
I don't even know how old I am
There's no way
What color is the dirt?
What direction is east?
I'm afraid there is no time
She's a bride
Tom's parents left him
She's hooked on Farmville
He's my son
That's a really wonderful plan
Look, I said no!
Hand it over!
It's a good book
Little pig, let me come in.
Come in.
You know I'm the wolf.
Yes, I do
It's nothing I can't handle
Did you catch the train?
What's for dinner tonight?
What's your maiden name?
Where's the dining room?
Do you think it'll fit?
Is Sicily very close to Malta?
I didn't get the invitation
I didn't get the book
It's sheer madness
Poor little boy!
It's gone to shit!
He's a Bohemian
Don't knock Tom
He's doing his best
Don't get near that dog
Ah, someone made me a sandwich
I'm from Spain
Look!
There's a cat in the kitchen!
Have you brought the book?
I don't feel like getting up
Have you seen my pen?
Need one make so much noise?
I have chosen you!
Of course not!
Of course yes!
Even Tom wasn't convinced
How is that spelled?
Is there a bank nearby?
Why don't you go to Boston?
How is this pronounced?
How is this word pronounced?
Is money important to you?
This really isn't an island
What is your favourite bird?
That's our planet
Come dance!
Come eat!
A year has 12 months
Didn't you see any birds?
Did you see any birds?
If Tom goes, I won't
If Tom goes, I won't go
He is twenty-four years old
You want to get beaten up?
Do you smell something funny?
What does Tom have on?
When did Tom get back?
Tom didn't come after all
Tom didn't accept my apologies
Justice demands retribution!
My hand is too full!
I don't like being judged
What is the year of your car?
Who is in the car?
Marija.
There's something in your hair
Sorry, I said too much
I'll wait at the bus stop
Boys are all morons, eh..
I'm sorry I was born
It's obviously a lie
Sorry, I complained a lot
Let's talk again some time
There's sad news
What is happiness to you?
Can I borrow the hair dryer?
Do you think there are aliens?
Are you okay?
Perhaps you have a fever?
Don't cry
I'll start crying too
You're tired, aren't you?
Don't be a crybaby!
Why don't you go to bed?
You're tired, aren't you?
Why don't you get to bed?
Did you ever find it?
Would you like milk and sugar?
A former wife is an ex-wife
Power?
Money?
When did the meeting adjourn?
Instead, I could help you out
How come that happened to us?
Hey!
We've just had dinner
Why are you not with me?
She didn't drink the milk
Do you know Turkish?
Why don't you go to a bank?
What are we having today?
What do we have today?
What day are we on?
You'll be there, won't you?
Tom is red-green colour blind
Don't use another language!
Are you drunk or something?
I didn't go to the zoo
I'm gonna do it for the money.
No.
I'd like to be as rich as him
Have you ever been in Italy?
God, I hate my job
Have you ever seen Tom angry?
Have you ever seen Tom mad?
It's all irrelevant anyway
Did I get you right?
You were saying?
Oh, that
What, again?
Tom doesn't eat raw fish
Tom doesn't have to know
Tom doesn't like bananas
Tom doesn't have a hat on
Tom doesn't have any pets
Tom won't be here tonight
Tom doesn't have any proof
Tom didn't go home yesterday
Tom doesn't live very far away
I'm really grateful to you
I don't know who did it
Don't let them win
Let me know when you're done
I didn't warn you
Stop pouting!
Stop sulking!
I'll send it to you tomorrow
Anyone fancy a cuppa?
Who was this done by?
By whom was this done?
They're typical youngsters
I've got to go to the bank
I'm so disappointed in him
Okay, I got it
Damn, it's hot!
We're intimate friends
You can't be young
They haven't given up at all
What stop is this?
Where's the metro?
Where's the subway?
Why should this happen?
Maybe I'll leave tomorrow
Sorry, I'm late
When does the game start?
I'm reading your book
He's always punctual
She has 1001 wishes
I'm not made of money
I'm going to call my daughter
I'm sick of eating fast food
I'm fed up with fast food
Sorry to bother you!
I'm in prison
I wouldn't do it otherwise
That's how I like it
That's how we want it written
I'll come at five o'clock
It's snowing outside, cover up
Cover up, we're going to leave
This is my sister, Aynur
You can't do this!
Which food do you like best?
First the emigrants, then you
I'd like to be as rich as Tom
Tom won't come to our party
Tom is a third-year student
Can I stop over in Boston?
This is my sister, Mary
This is my brother, Tom
How did you like Boston?
Tom is a salesman, too
Does Tom know French?
Are you winning?
Is your French improving?
I don't trust talkative people
She's due soon
This isn't your hat, is it?
Tom, this is my brother, John
What does he do?
March 14 is Pi Day
Don't worry
Tom broke something again?
What's he doing over there?
He's twenty-four years old
I hate celery!
Tom can't come in
A fly fell in the soup!

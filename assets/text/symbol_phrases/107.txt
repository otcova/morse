How are you?
I know that you're a teacher
Where is the city hall?
Can I dance here?
I'm retired
Hey, look on the bright side!
She's wearing sunglasses
Leave it!
I think it won't rain tomorrow
I'm going outside to play
Are you coming with?
God can do anything!
He's my older brother
He's my younger brother
What will you make?
What do you make?
And which class are you in?
I am also in A.
It seems that he's happy
Around here, everyone skis
I'm crazy about football
We don't have class today
How was your flight?
Attention!
Go screw yourself!
He's from the U.S
Please, let me go through!
No, not really.
'Story'?" the woman asked
What do you mean?
He's depressed
My telephone number is 789
My room number is 5
Speak slowly, please
I'm sorry to spoil your plans
My phone number is 789
It's a doll
What do you wish for?
That's none of your business
I don't want to be used
I've already said no
Don't teach fish to swim
I mean... my life," Dima said
What is love?
Screw you!
Buy Belarusian!
Dogs aren't people
First of all, remember that
Buy!
Buy!
How should I go about it?
Larry Ewing doesn't answer me
That's life
There's no escape for her
That's a book
There's a book here
It's your book
I'll give you a book
How long will you be in Japan?
Are you Japanese?
A bottle of rosé, please
One roll of color film, please
I'm to blame, not you
I don't speak Catalan
It won't take so long
Do you plan to stay long?
It won't take that long
Oh!
Really?
Today is April 1!
Let's play some pranks!
What is Assembla?
You're up to something
You shouldn't go out
You shouldn't be angry
I'd rather stay than go
I'd like to attend the party
I also want to know!
Hurry!
There's no time to lose
Is my answer correct?
The film began at 2
Could you pass the salt?
What was the hotel called?
I can't remember
Whose guitar is this?
Window or aisle?
What are you up to?
They're all the same size
No, I didn't write it
No, I didn't go
Goodbye!
May I go to the toilet?
May I go to the bathroom?
May I go to the restroom?
Where should we go?
Where shall we go?
I'm glad to see you!
I'm fed up with all their lies
You're asking for too much
Do you like Schweppes?
Let's take a ten-minute break
We're converging, you and I
What's up, dawg?
Stones don't swim
It's okay to go
You'd better go
Wherever you go, I will follow
Are you going or not?
I'll be there right away
I'll be there at once
The museum is open from 9 a.m
How many is nine minus six?
It's nearly six o'clock
Surely," Dima grinned
You must be joking!
It'll soon be six o'clock
It's almost six
It's nearly three o'clock
It'll soon be three o'clock
It looks like it's rained
A meter is 100 centimeters
What is this letter?
Is Mr Sato good at literature?
Do you like French literature?
You're quite smart
I can't love anyone but you
Guess who I met today!
Workers of all lands, unite!
Have you ever seen a koala?
You're not a doctor
No," the shopkeeper replied
I'm quite serious
You saw the price tag.
Come on, let's go!
She's my best friend
What children!
It's within walking distance
I don't love her anymore
She's a quiet person
Could you take me to a movie?
I don't feel like working
They vandalized my BMW!
It's a good question
But that's ridiculous!
He's a high school student
Relax, it's just a scarecrow
Do you speak German?
She's in the restroom
Here's my confirmation card
We'll take a two-week holiday
You can pay more if you like.
So that's how it is!
Yea, that's all it is
Our refrigerator isn't working
I'm an alcoholic
I'm a drug addict
I'm homosexual
I'm a genius
And you?
Hello, I am Sepideh
I don't like cold coffee
That's my pussy
She's Alain's wife
She's a professor
Good morning, Haruki
Good morning, Haruki
You really sleep a lot!
There's no mistake
Please don't be so noisy
Don't put books on the table
He's my best friend
It's as if he were my brother
He's my best friend
We're like brothers
No more, no less.
I'm a French citizen
This is hot, not cold
It happened on the 1st of May
May I?
I'll cook tonight
Mummy, where's my hanky?
You're no match for him
Tom is a math-geek
Do you really mean that?
It's still in limbo
He's not stupid
There's no poison in this fish
It's raining non-stop
I'm not a sentence
It's time to separate
It wasn't expensive
Why are you going to Japan?
Yes, tomorrow is my day off
What?
Do you like to dance?
I think he'll never return
Now you're an adult
I've been very lucky today
He's smarter than them
He's fluent in Japanese
You're a new student?
He's good by nature
He's a smart boy
What a big dog!
He's blond
What's your blood type?
He's not first but second
It's high time to get going!
Why does he look so black?
He's an Englishman
Are you studying chemistry?
I'm grateful for your help
Can I get something to eat?
That's a trivial error
Can I park my car here?
He has read "The Manifest
Really good!
I washed my t-shirt
Goodbye for ever!
When are you free?
Let's turn off the telly
That's 486-2435, area code 213
Did you speak with your wife?
It's not far from here
We're married
If I could, I would
He didn't get the joke
Don't tell anyone this
It's not a classroom
It's not a class
Have you heard that?
Don't pick your nose!
Did you make this yourself?
What do I have to do?
You're grown up now
He's definitely not coming
Do you study every day?
I'm sick of it!
I'm fed up with it!
If you hurt her, I'll kill you
I've never been abroad before
Give me more milk!
What came first?
The egg or the hen?
There's also a park there
Why wait for Christmas?
We're going dancing tonight
What is your problem?
She's divorced
Where are we going tonight?
I like your plan a lot!
I don't know if I'll have time
Muiriel's twenty
If she comes, I'll go too
If he comes, I'll go too
No, it's not me
It's you!
I've forgotten your number
He doesn't sing well
Let it go!
Don't feel so bad
I'm tired of dancing
How much did you pay for him?
You're lightly dressed
They still haven't woken up
So you're a man after all
Where did you see this woman?
That won't have an effect
He's such a lazy bum!
I can't remember now
Slowly, please
Don't touch the glass
It's always been like that
What a wonderful family!
What!
It's no big deal
Can you imagine?
It's pretty windy today, no?
He's a university student
Can you give me a ride?
Maybe you'll come back to me?
He's brighter than they are
You're the only one for me now
What will you do?
Milk doesn't mix with water
China's developing too quickly
We need a medical team here!
Go and call the guests!
What?!
That's no excuse!
Money doesn't buy happiness
How's your mother?
I'm tired!
I can't take any more!
I don't think it's odd at all
You know Grievous Bodily Harm?
Put this on my tab, please
Who's this man?
That's not a man
It's a robot I thought up!
Act faster!
Frankly, I don't like that man
I met you; that is enough
Don't forget death
Life is hard, death is cheap
It's fine just the two of us
We don't need anyone else
You're all cowards
Aa, Aaaaa~~ It's about to leak
I love Fist of the North Star!
Thanks a lot!
I think I'm gonna shit myself
I knew I could rely on you!
He's sitting at the table
He came about four o'clock
I'm bursting for a pee
You're all chickenshits
Do you have a cellphone?
There's going to be a downpour
Crap!
We're out of vermicelli!
Pancake!
We're out of vermicelli!
They both weren't ready
Who likes insects?
He's a rather rare individual
She's a rather rare individual
You like her, don't you?
You like him, don't you?
Does she play piano?
It's great to have you back
Why did I do that?
That's bullshit!
Who are the Uyghurs?
I don't know.
Orange juice, please
Isn't a problem at all, is it?
The weather is so nice!
My monkey ran away!
I'd like an orange juice
Their life's really not so bad
This is a life-sized statue
Together or separately?
That'll be three euros
Malware?
I don't give a fig about my CV
What's the catch?
Do you care to hazard a guess?
No beer before four!
Let's go to Paul's Diner
I don't know how to say it
I forgot my PIN number!
She mistook me for Mr. Tamori
I mistook him for Mr. Brown
Romans, go home!
My father's hobby is fishing
Walakum-us-Salam, Al-Sayib!
What are you up to these days?
That's not what I mean
Do you have a boyfriend?
Here's the change
What on earth is it?
He should come right away!
Wang Lao Ji isn't beer
It's tea
Wait, who is this?
It's cool this morning, innit?
It's his, innit?
English is difficult, innit?
Beautiful day, innit?
Where will you be?
She didn't tell me her secret
Let's get out of here
You shouldn't have gone there
Crap!
I fell for his trap!
Do you like your new job?
Man doesn't eat man
He's my first love
She's my first love
Forgive me, my love
Has the mailman already come?
Mr. Wilson is angry at Dennis
I'll bring the glasses
She's got more books
It's Dima!
How do you explain that?
Shall we start?
This word isn't used like that
My dreams just get larger!
I won't smoke from today on
I'm lonely without you
I don't trust businessmen
No thank you, I'm pregnant
Whose bicycle is that?
No, but thanks for offering.
Haven't I met you before?
Don't make fun of people
We don't have sugar
I don't know any Dima
We don't have any sugar
Thanks for the good advice!
Where is the railway station?
Where is the station?
Where's the boss?
You're my princess
I have to find a part-time job
It's no wonder you ask
Huh?
Dima didn't understand
But isn't this Al-Sayib?
Don't give in to peer pressure
Is it my turn?
I usually get up at 8
What are you?
The idea isn't bad
Yes, that's me," said Al-Sayib
Never take a blind man's arm
That's hardly believable
What a pain!
Measure thrice, cut once
I'm disturbing you
I see," Dima sighed
Sorry for the confusion, then
Forwards!
I don't like sand
I don't like bad children
It wasn't your fault
It's out of the question!
Not for all the tea in China!
I've lost my pin number!
I can't remember
I don't remember
I'll go to the hospital today
I'll go to Kyoto
I'll go to the park
Is everything all set now?
No way!
It's fun to knead dough
What are you hinting at?
Why did you lie?
Honey, come to bed.
No, not yet
He's a bit lively
He's a bit energetic
Don't say, do
No...
Let me try the other 960s.
A dream..
Man, that's hard!
The book was published in 1689
He's learning Chinese
Once, I got lost inside a tree
I've seen that movie before
How did it happen?
Don't drink so much beer
How about another beer?
How about a beer?
All my cakes are delicious!
I'm not disturbing you, am I?
I have 13 cats
I'm majoring in economics
I'm flying to Hanoi tomorrow
Beer is prohibited before 4:00
What is the cost of a beer?
How much is a beer?
I heard that you're not coming
He's antisocial
Don't beat about the bush
Have you gone completely mad?
Don't be too strict
They're just kids
The room key, please
Are you in a good mood?
I think I'll buy this tie
I'm on campus at the moment
I'm looking through his report
He's my friend
We're learning Chinese
We're studying Chinese
He's studying Chinese
What are you preparing?
She's in the bathroom
I didn't hear anything
Tom likes tomatoes?
Am I mistaken?
Where's the closest pharmacy?
What's the name of this bird?
What is this bird called?
This won't help you
Measure seven times, cut once
I'd like to go to France
That's all I know
I'm not kidding
I couldn't believe it!
We don't have the same values
We don't share the same values
Shit, I blew a fuse!
His birthday is May 5th
I'll take a vacation this week
If mind is clean, fate is good
I don't love you anymore
Who's this dapper young man?
I've never seen such a big dog
She's inquisitive by nature
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Have you already chosen?
Have you already voted?
Do you have one-day tours?
Do you speak Hebrew?
What's your first name?
What is your first name?
I can't reach the skylight
You're really something
That's exactly what it means!
Has your father arrived yet?
Look!
The train has arrived!
I have time, so I'll do it
I don't mind if I do!
Give time, time
What's all that racket?
Did you ask after her?
What did she say?
Don't mind if I do!
It's the truth
Keep working hard!
Everybody row in concert!
Sorry I startled you!
Don't come in here, please!
Walakum-us-Salam, Al-Sayib!
What are you up to these days?
It's easy
To arms!
She's well stacked
I'm undecided as of yet
That doesn't cut the mustard
I'm famished!
Do you want a drink?
It's all or nothing
Yes or no?
I won't go in
Aren't they Englishmen?
Dima?!
Dima?!
Is that really you?!
He's going to get fired
He's a fast walker
So, what else is new?
He couldn't corral his anger
I'm back
You lucky devil!
You changed the size?
In the end, we got to the lake
This music's annoying everyone
Did you hear the noise?
I don't have time to be sick
When did you first meet him?
How big you've gotten!
Yikes!
They'll go shopping
Could it be...?
It's as good as finished
Keep your eyes peeled!
How did you arrive? - By foot
Did your wish come true?
Is Mr. Johnson in?
Your "proof" is sophistic
Blow me down!
Why do physicists converge?
Don't let the dog in
She's very happy-go-lucky
He's a master of provocation
You just don't
Just where are you, Dima?!
I'm a policeman
I'm a student
Keep up the good work!
I'll explain it to you
Stop frowning your forehead!
Please introduce yourself, sir
What's your profession?
No!
I don't find that funny!
I don't find that funny
You're a right little rascal!
You can't park on the pavement
The headlights don't work
Do you like white chocolate?
I'm a college student
I'm a university student
You've got two books?
You have two books?
Can I bum a cigarette off you?
He's also a salesman
He's a salesman too
It's beginning to take form!
Masha didn't know her parents
This hat's too small for you
I can't quite place his accent
Do tigers purr?
This won't work!
I don't want to risk my life
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Republic!
You know what he said?
How many friends do you have?
How are things at work?
Do you have plans for tonight?
Why do you look so worn out?
How are things?
What are you doing right now?
We're meeting on Sunday
She doesn't have many friends
I'm going to the doctor
You like to sing?
This doesn't work!
I wasn't dancing!
She's wearing a hat
Step 1
Are you going, too?
Will you go, too?
Upon seeing that, he stood up
Seeing that, he stood up
Do you have a question?
Do you have any cheaper rooms?
What?" asked Al-Sayib
You're really too kind
Haven't you said too much?
Do you buy that explanation?
Good shot, kid
It's on me
No worries!
International TV?
'Aha', they will say
Call the doctor!
Tatoeba: Got a PM?
You're probably in trouble..
Have mercy!
I see that you're a patriot
It doesn't work
Today I'm lacking inspiration
What a huge dog!
Al-Sayib exclaimed
How the heck did you do that?!
You need to study more!
I'm a citizen of Earth
Don't jinx me
Klava pulled everybody's leg
They're very optimistic
Please, give me water!
Are you still alive, Sysko?
I'm already ready
He's not my cousin
I'll prepare some for you
I'm a tennis player
Tony is a well-behaved boy
It's nothing but flattery
Wait, don't shoot!
I'd like to eat a book
That's not within my remit
You don't understand
He'll kill you
In one night," Dima added
She hasn't heard the news yet
That's why I came late
It's a question of taste
We need Nāhuatl speakers!
Wait, don't shoot yourself!
Dostoyevsky is dead.
I object!
Dostoyevsky's immortal!
And just who are you, exactly?
What's done is done
Cats don't wear collars
We can't keep a sheep at home
What should we do with it?
Let's go home!
You'll sleep in the guestroom?
Come on, already!
Won't you sit on my knee?
High five!
It's really coming down!
Let's rent bicycles over there
I'll gladly pay you anytime
Could I get your autograph?
Just where were you?
And what will you be?
What wonderful presents!
Boy am I happy!
Love if you want to be loved!
The ship's going to sink!
Even worse!
Al-Sayib exclaimed
She loved me, as I loved her
Don't forget us!
I don't want that anymore
How far away is the airport?
Here's the thing
I'll have to call you back
I won't go back there
Thanks, that's everything
Every morning, I go shopping
Do you want to dance with me?
I'll go by car
Tom, don't die
Don't be ridiculous!
She shouldn't get carried away
It's complicated as hell
Now what is it?!
What do you mean?
Enough jawboning!
It's nothing special
Stop fooling around!
What a nightmare!
Let's get back to business
He'll leave for Tokyo tomorrow
It was a put-up job
She's disgusted with the job
I don't like to make a mistake
I haven't the foggiest idea
Do you have time on Tuesday?
When do you get up?
At 8 in the morning.
I've been to Kyoto twice
Please, show me these photos
He'll wait for you
I'm a man
I'm waiting for someone
Which one are you, Dima?
Care for a smoke?
I've had my fill of the tea
Don't rip me off!
Don't screw me over!
All piggybackers are pigs!
Once a noob, always a noob
You're such a night owl!
Hit the bricks!
What's up with that?!
For love.
Here's looking at you, kid
That idea isn't bad
I'll be here for a while
Sleeping in a dumpster, huh?
Al-Sayib asked
That's strange
Eat fast food, die fast
I don't know how to go there
Don't take it to heart
I'm already full, thank you
You don't like me
I love you, my angel
I'd like a glass of tequila
Arrgghh!
What is apathy?
He's got lots of sex appeal
So who were the 25?
Al-Sayib asked
Friends of yours?
Where can I buy books?
Where can I buy a CD?
Then, yes.
To be honest," said Dima
Noobs," Al-Sayib stated
Noobs?
This is real life!
So why'd you call?
To hire a good lawyer?
Al-Sayib asked
No," Dima replied
I'm dirty, remember?
Oh, boy...
Al-Sayib sighed
Well, how much do you need?
I need 99 kopeks.
Dima...
Al-Sayib said
But it's true!
Can't you wire me some money?
Dima...
Al-Sayib sighed
Dima," Al-Sayib said sternly
Goodbye!
He just doesn't measure up
How are you doing?
I haven't seen you in ages!
You're a dobber!
You're a grass!
Are you going to a movie?
Do you eat in the classroom?
Don't cave into their demands
I don't like raw cut edges
Do you know it?
Well, he's a right scallywag
We've lost 3 to 0
She's a very good teacher
She didn't think so
No, I didn't go out
No, I didn't help
Peace be with you!
He isn't here now
Hello, my dear
Is there life before death?
I definitely told you that!
Anyway, I did my best
If I knew that, I'd tell you
I'm satisfied
It's my younger brother's
It's perfectly white
It's all white
She's a good person
I don't like eggs
He's a kind person
She's a kind person
My mother isn't at home
He's an author
It's snowing today
It'll snow today
It's 2:00 p.m
That's a tower
He's now studying
He's studying
He's studying now
He's the oldest son
I'll be back in a jiffy
I'll be back right away
That's an understatement!
What's your hobby?
Do you want to rest?
What time is supper?
Do you like baseball?
Does it taste okay?
How many passengers are there?
What time do we leave?
Are you looking for something?
Is it really bad?
He'll go, too, won't he?
The skies won't be clear
The weather won't be fine
It won't clear up
The color won't fade
Don't go near the fire
Shut the fuck up!
Where is my dad?
Where were you yesterday?
Go figure!
They'll rob you blind
It's just like a human
Is that your car?
How fast is that train going?
You look dead, bud
What's your name?
She is a true witch!
Think before you act!
You ain't gonna cut it
They stole my wine bottle!
You sure are a hooligan!
Don't forget to write me
Why did this happen?
Let's walk to the bookstore
She gets 5% of my gains
That's nonsense
How can I get to the stadium?
Get in the car, babe
We're driving to Madagascar
Don't miss it
To the Hilton Hotel please!
It's only your imagination
Pardon me, please
Oh!
It's getting late
I'm ashamed of myself
Let's come back
What's missing?
I sure hope you'll come again
I can't fall asleep
We missed you!
I don't see it
Let's take a short pause
I'm pooped
She's got two cats
She's so stubborn
Lighten up!
I can't agree more
Don't get me started
I don't want an apology
What's the catch?
Wanna tag along?
Oh, how we laughed!
A point in their favor!
How do you say...?
What!
I LOVE him!
What!
I LOVE her!
What would you do if I died?!
What would I do if you died?!
It's a bit strange to me
Is this thing edible?
Don't forget your money
Is THIS edible?
Could you actually eat this?
Oh my god, a newbie owned me!
I've forgotten my pin number
Here is the father's hat
To me, it is important
For me, it's important
Dead dogs don't bite
Does it happen to no teacher?
I did, and it won't.
Rise and shine, Johnny!
Rise and shine, Johnny
Come on, you can tell me
Time is of the essence, Paul
I am your only hope, captain
Do you want me to go with you?
I don't work on Mondays
At seven I'll be back
Nobody at home?
She is bad-mannered
This is life in the fast lane!
Don't lose heart!
She could be right, mind you
I'm about to come already
You've got a poor memory!
I work for McDonald's
Don't abandon me!
Where are you working?
Allah is the greatest!
The Lord be most exalted!
Is that your carriage?
Do you believe ghosts exist?
Cat?", the old man wondered
I'm with you
Go to hell!
Go boil your head!
Go fuck yourself!
Do you have a light?
Do you understand what I mean?
It's worth a shot
Is her father a doctor?
Is your father a doctor?
I can't talk
I'll keep my fingers crossed
I always say yes!
Let's dance all night long!
I'm not in good shape
It doesn't matter anymore
It hadn't crossed my mind
It's hot in here
I'm in the bath
I'm following their every move
Go on, snigger
Can I speak with Judy?
What's this smell?
He doesn't mean to be mean
It's just his nature
What do you want to do today?
Checkmate!
Hello Mimi!
How are you?
Make sure it's worth watching
Are you well?
Don't add annotations
You don't need to call me
Change the flag, please
She's never fallen in love
Should we change the flag?
He's just kidding you
What's your poison?
Oh, give me a gin and tonic.
That's easier said than done.
That's why I study them
G'day
He's not as strong as before
He who says big, does a little
He's as strong as a horse
He's as timid as a rabbit
He's very timid
Yes, she'll probably come home
Could you serve us expressly?
There's no more room in hell
Run for your life!
What is this called?
What is this thing called?
What is this item called?
He will come on June 24th
I'll never leave you
Don't release that dog
Don't let that dog go
I don't know where my watch is
Eureka!

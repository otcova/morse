I'm sorry I can't help you now
I'm busy
Why is everyone so excited?
You're working too fast
You'll make mistakes
It's a bargain!
No, they will!
How often do you eat out?
I'm from Diyarbakir
I'm from Syria
I don't like office politics
You owe me money.
No, I don't.
Are you eating properly?
Someone's been here
Can you fill out this form?
Tom is poor, but he's happy
Keep an eye on the baking!
Is Tom going to be arrested?
I'm glad you came
Oh, that's crazy
Hey, you're early
Here, let me help
Would you like me to help?
I'm going hunting
Is Tom badly hurt?
That's not what I said at all
No, I'm not stupid
Preheat the oven to 400ºF
Let's all give Tom a hand
Crying won't solve anything
Is that illegal?
Enjoy!
It's not dessert time yet
It's obvious.
It's obvious.
Really?
You're joking.
I'm not.
She's totally in love with him
I'm glad I did it
Maybe you'd better leave
Do you mind if I leave?
I'm listening to this song
Who was this book written by?
What is the scale of this map?
Could you come to collect me?
Have you ever kissed a girl?
They'll look after me
May I ask another question?
Could I ask one more question?
Would it be OK if I sat here?
Oh, so that's what that is!
But Mom!
Don't 'mom' me.
This hasn't been easy for me
You won't be able to forget me
That car could've hit me
You don't look happy to see me
Hey, listen to me
You could've just talked to me
You don't have to wait with me
I don't know when he'll come
I don't know what we'll do
How's it feel now?
How's it look now?
Here, use my pen
Mary?
I'll try to fix it later
Is that all you think about?
I'm a rookie
Tom's eyes are shut
Oh, that's silly
Is the message clear?
It's not my job to do that
Maybe you'd better not do that
Hey, I heard that
Why quit now?
Why did they fire you?
Why can't we work together?
Why can't I drive?
Why can't I do it?
Who wants me dead?
Who stole my keys?
Who needs a drink?
Who cooks for you?
Wow, look at this
OK, let's do this
Here, try a bite of this
Should I call 911?
Do you want to tag along?
Should I call 112?
Should I call the police?
Now, can we try this again?
Now, please leave me alone
Now, let's play some baseball
Now, that's better
Now, this won't hurt a bit
Now, take a deep breath
Now, listen to me carefully
Now, let's not get discouraged
Now, what am I supposed to do?
Now, I have some work to do
Now, get me a drink
Now, open your eyes
Now, where did you come from?
Now, let's get going
Now, I need your help
Now, come over here
Now, why are you here?
Now, you'd better go home
Now, this may hurt
Now, that's an idea
Now, let me handle it
Now, shut up and listen
Now, let's have a look
Now, please excuse me
Now, would you excuse me?
Now, will you help me?
Now, wait just a minute
Now, wait a minute
Now, let's go outside
Now, who has a question?
Now, answer my question
Now, that's ridiculous
Now, I'm going to my room
Now, wait just a second
Now, hold on just a second
Now, hang on a second
Now, wait a second
Now, what do you want to see?
Now, how did that get there?
Now, take a look at this
Now, where did you get this?
Now, help me with this
Now, it's your turn
Now, that's not so unusual
Now, what can I do for you?
Now, how can I help you?
Now, it's my turn to help you
Now, how can we help you?
That's my gym bag
Where's my appointment book?
That's why I came
It's a nice change
It's a good choice
How was class?
Where should I put my coat?
That's what I did
How was dinner?
I'm going to go and lie down
Are you both drunk?
I'm afraid of dying
Come on, it's easy
OK, that's enough
It's a bad example
He's my stepbrother
They'll accept the gifts
I was born on January 22, 1933
Now, join the game
I'm having lots of fun
It's kind of late
Wow, that's great
Take a break, guys
Sorry, I can't help
No one's been here
It's warm in here
It's cold out here
I'm not going home
I'd like a hug
No one's been hurt
I can't discuss it
Here, let me do it
Maybe I'll try it
Do you have a spare key?
Do you have an extra key?
That's all I knew
That's how I know
That's why I left
That's why I lied
Well, that's life
Wow, thanks a lot
Look, just call me
Come on, follow me
Does it involve me?
Go ahead, shoot me
Do they suspect me?
Are you teasing me?
Have I missed much?
It's over!
It's a common name
That's all I need
It's very late now
Are you scared now?
Here, put these gloves on
Are your eyes open?
Here, check it out
OK, I'm persuaded
Wow, you're right
What color is your dress?
Isn't it the other way around?
That's all I said
That's what I saw
Do you have a bathing suit?
It's a good system
I know you're not doing that
Well, that's that
I could drive if you're tired
That's what I loved about Tom
We're all worried about Tom
The prisoner has escaped!
Could I stay and help you?
What?
I, uh...
Screw you!
It isn't difficult
I'm too old for such things
That's a good excuse
I didn't feel them landing
Are they still on my hair?
Oh, now I see them
How beautiful they are!
I'm not really mad at Tom
At first, I didn't believe Tom
What's really bothering Tom?
I'm glad Tom is at home
Maybe you'd better call Tom
You're supposed to call Tom
There's no way I can catch Tom
How high does a sycamore grow?
You're supposed to help Tom
How are you going to help Tom?
That's only a toy
Sorry, I can't wait
I'm going to go for a walk
That's all I want
What kind of gift do you want?
Tom's hair is wet
OK, where were we?
Who are you?
What're you doing here?
How tired are you?
Does it bother you?
Did Tom contact you?
It's good for you
We're here to rescue you
Did I startle you?
My wife's pregnant
Love me!
You're taking an awful risk
Why don't you come on down?
Who's your friend?
Who's the guy on the left?
Who sent the flowers?
What's that in your pocket?
What's all this stuff?
What're you listening to?
That's a good-looking woman
That's a funny looking car
So, how's it going?
My band's playing tonight
Let's pull an all-nighter
Let's bake cookies
It's Tom's birthday tomorrow
Is this guy bothering you?
Is this cool or what?
I've got the afternoon free
I'm trying to work
I'm not your lab assistant
I'm not unemployed
I'm not done here
I'm making guacamole
I'm going to call Tom later
I'm calling the police
I'll visit whenever I can
I still think it's good
I can't go yet
How was the movie?
How long have you known me?
How did the photo session go?
How did the interview go?
How did the audition go?
Have you been waiting for me?
Don't get mad at us
Don't get all mushy on me
Do you want my job?
Do you have any real coffee?
Do you believe this?
Did you want to drive?
Did I miss the turn?
Can you do me a tiny favor?
Can we use your ball?
Can I hide in here?
Are you sure I can't help?
Are you fucking around?
Are we fucked?
Are we screwed?
Damn they've got a nice house!
I don't wanna be his friend
I don't wanna be her friend
I don't wanna be your friend
I don't want to be his friend
I don't want to be her friend
It smells weird, doesn't it?
What chord is that?
Who can best do the job?
No one other than Tom.
I can't wait to turn eighty
Have you ever failed a class?
What is critical thinking?
You'll accept the gifts
All right, Tom, try it now
I'm not the jealous type
Just stop bugging me, okay?
Turn on, tune in, drop out
He's addicted to porn
Sport doesn't interest me
Can I escort you anywhere?
Do I sound that pessimistic?
What a remarkable achievement!
What did your mom say?
I'm good friends with Tom
I'm expected
I'm a lawyer
They'll help us
That's mine, too
What's your problem?
What's it used for?
This can't be real
That's a good sign
That's a cool idea
Oh, we're too late
Oh, that's too bad
Oh, that's so cool
Oh, that's a shame
Does that scare you?
Did you design this?
Did I wake you guys?
Did I mess up again?
Did I embarrass you?
Are you stalking me?
Are you leaving now?
Are you avoiding me?
I think I'll do that
Who wrote this report?
Is that coffee I smell?
Where have you two been?
Were you at Tom's party?
That's not exactly right
Do you like rock and roll?
What did you end up doing?
Where did you put the keys?
That's exactly what I said
Did you hear Tom is leaving?
Could I get a copy of these?
Are you calling me a coward?
Where did you learn to drive?
When did this package arrive?
We've been working all night
I've been trying to find you
I'm on my way home from work
I'm not going to get married
What have you guys been up to?
That's no way to treat a lady
Let me know when you're ready
Do you want me to do anything?
Do you need me to pick you up?
Are you guys talking about me?
Have you guys seen my glasses?
I can't find them
Do you want a cup?
What should I do if Tom comes?
I wasn't the one who got lost
I wasn't the one who did that
I don't need you to pick me up
Preheat oven to 200ºC (400ºF)
She didn't know who I was
Tom didn't know who I was
I've attempted suicide twice
None!
I'm so confused right now
Hey, watch yourself
Hey, where are you?
Hey, I was going to call you
Hey, I can't help you
Hey, I want to help you
Hey, let me help you
Hey, it's good to see you
Hey, I need to talk to you
Hey, I'm talking to you
Hey, where were you?
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Hey, we aren't done yet
Hey, what's wrong?
Hey, it could be worse
Hey, shouldn't you be at work?
Hey, where are we?
Hey, it's still warm
Hey, I know what I want
Hey, everybody, listen up
Hey, what're you listening to?
Hey, look at the time
Hey, here's a thought
Hey, Tom, look at this
Hey, leave me out of this
Hey, listen to this
Hey, get away from there
Hey, let's go in there
Hey, you can't go in there
Hey, look over there
Hey, what's that over there?
Hey, can I have that?
Hey, did you hear that?
Hey, I already thought of that
Hey, we'd better get started
Hey, I said I was sorry
Hey, look at the snow
Hey, what's that smell?
Hey, I'm on your side
Hey, long time no see
Hey, hold on a second
Hey, wait a second
Hey, where's your ring?
Hey, is everything all right?
Hey, who wants pizza?
Hey, check this out
Hey, you only live once
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, you can't leave now
Hey, what's that noise?
Hey, what's all the noise?
Hey, that's really neat
Hey, watch your mouth
Hey, wait a minute
Hey, don't blame me
I'm just the messenger
Hey, your dog just bit me
Hey, did you hear me?
Hey, get your hands off me
Hey, where are you taking me?
Hey, what's the matter?
Hey, what took you so long?
Hey, that's my line
Hey, what do I know?
Hey, I'm only kidding
Hey, I'm just doing my job
Hey, that's my job
Hey, I can handle it
Hey, let's get on with it
Hey, here's an idea
Hey, I have an idea
Hey, that's not a bad idea
Hey, I've got a better idea
Hey, that's a good idea
Hey, I have a great idea
Hey, that's a great idea
Hey, what a great idea!
Hey, come back here
Hey, I just got here
Hey, don't turn off the lights
I'm working in here
Hey, what's going on in here?
Hey, let's get out of here
Hey, what's going on here?
Hey, I'm right here
Hey, I can help
Hey, can I help?
Hey, do you want some help?
Hey, thanks for the help
Hey, I'm only trying to help
Hey, I need your help
Hey, you look great
Hey, that was really great
Hey, look what I've got
Hey, that smells good
Hey, you don't look so good
Hey, how's it going?
Hey, wait a minute
Hey, what's so funny?
Hey, look what I found
Hey, what are friends for?
Hey, that's what I'm here for
Hey, I know how you feel
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Hey, I need a favor
Hey, would you do me a favor?
Hey, thanks for everything
Hey, where is everybody?
Hey, listen up, everybody
Hey, open the door
Hey, look what I'm doing
Hey, I'm not a doctor
Hey, look what I'm going to do
Hey, this is delicious
Hey, what's the deal?
Hey, why are you crying?
Hey, that's kind of cool
Hey, that's really cool
Hey, quit complaining
Hey, let's go camping
Hey, it's none of my business
Hey, get off my bike
Hey, I got you a beer
Hey, that's not bad
Hey, it's not so bad
Hey, I'll be right back
Hey, put that back
Hey, what's behind your back?
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Hey, what are you looking at?
Um, teach?
Yes, Tom?
I think I broke the flask.
That's how they get their food
That's my jam!
If not, let's go watch a movie
That is my favorite song!
A right friend you are!
She's crazy about tennis
Are we going right?
What is Tom's real purpose?
How can I unsend an email?
Why were you talking to him?
What's wrong, Mary?
I don't know.
Look at those guys play!
He's a very sweet guy
What's wrong with you, Maria?
I don't know.
Tom is a law-abiding citizen
Did you kill Mary?
Did you kill Mary?
No, I did not.
Tom's story keeps changing
I know how to samba!
I'm speaking Ottoman
The summer is over, isn't it?
I can do this, can't I?
Did you call me fat?
I'm ill, aren't I?
You're a renegade
Aimee's in the bathroom now
Why should we elect him mayor?
So what?
They've arrived!
And none too soon!
Tom's a bright boy
How old is your child?
I'm glad my cold is better
I'm glad your cold is better
Have you ever played hooky?
Have you ever skipped school?
Can I touch your chest?
Can I touch your breasts?
Is this river shallow?
Why is everyone applauding?
What is this sound?
What is making this sound?
I'm not going if Tom is
I'm not going unless Tom goes
He's an old codger
Do you like the way you look?
OK, but why should he do that?
Father!
Hey, Zelda!
Hey, King!
Hey, Link!
Yes! ...Oh hell, I forgot.
How could you forget my face?
It looks so funny!
See?
Of course you forget me..
Oh, he was a bore anyway.
So what's for dinner?
He he, nothing, Father!
Yeah, we got a new king
It's Ganon!
You are my prisoner!
Oh crap.
Don't try to bullshit me
Why is life so difficult?
Why is love so difficult?
Mary wore knee-high boots
I'm not a fan of Ugg boots
Do you know where Boston is?
Do I have to know him?
You don't get owt for nowt
Quiet!
Oops!
Can I do this later?
Do I have to do this now?
Does this have to be done now?
I couldn't help yawning
This is Tom's cat
This cat is Tom's
It's simple as cake
And you know what ?
We're done !
Mary wore knee-high socks
We're the same size
It looks fabulous on you!
Tom, stop pulling my hair!
Give it mouth !
I'm really thankful to you.
Once again?
I can't stop myself
How can I repay you?
How did they find out?
I don't like Tom.
That makes two of us.
Tom will probably be late.
I think so, too.
This party's boring.
That's why Tom left.
Do not drink the water!
That's all I remember
That's not quite true
That's not very funny
That's not at all funny
That's very good news
That's what I believe
That's what I figured
That's what I need to do
That seems about right.
That's a horrible idea
That's a horrible plan
That's a little unfair
It's only a temporary fix
That's a very bad idea
That's a wise decision
That's all I have left
That's also a bad idea
That's not a bad guess
That's not a bad start
That's not quite right
That's very, very good
That's the whole story
That really isn't funny
That really isn't necessary
That really isn't what I meant
That's not funny at all
That's not how I see it
That's not what I think
That's not why I'm here
That's real nice of you
That's very good advice
I'm here not because of that
That wouldn't be any fun
That'll take a long time
That's a very good point
That's an excellent point
That's a really good point
That's exactly the point
That's kind of the point
That's precisely the point
That's really not the point
That's not really the point
That's sort of the point
That's a good rule to live by
That's not a good choice
That's not nearly good enough
That's not really good enough
That's a good reason, I guess
That's a good thing to have
That's a really good hospital
That wouldn't be a good idea
That's not such a good idea
That's probably a good idea
That's a very good question
I'm glad you asked it
That's a really good painting
That's a good idea
I'm going to do that
That wouldn't be a good thing
That's a good story, Tom
That's much more important
That's important to know
That's not important now
That's not important right now
That's how I do everything
That's it
I've done everything I can
That's it
I've done everything I can do
That's it
I've done all I can do
That's what you should do
That's what you always do
That's what I thought you said
That's very thoughtful of you
That's very nice of you to say
That's the last thing you want
That's not what you want to do
That's all you need to know
That's all I have for you
That's all I can offer you
That's a risk you have to take
May I turn off the lights?
That's why I'm here today
That's why I have to do this
That's why I brought this
That's why I said forget it
That's why I need your help
That's why I did what I did
That's why I'm a bachelor
That's what I thought, too
That's what I was thinking
That's what I'm thinking
That's what I was going to say
That's what I always say
That's what I should've said
That's what I was working on
That's what I'm counting on
That's what I'm frightened of
That's what I'm afraid of
That's what I need to know
That's what I'd like to know
That's what I wanted to hear
That's what I'm here for
That's what I thought at first
That's what I usually do
That's what I have to do
That's what I like to do
That's what I want to do
That's what I was trying to do
That's what I'd like to do
That's what I'd try to do
That's what I'm trying to do
That's what I do all day
That's what I'm worried about
That's exactly what I expected
That's just what I thought
That's all I was thinking
That's not what I was thinking
That's exactly what I think
That's how I like things
That's all I know for sure
That's all I wanted to say
That's all I've got to say
That's not what I was saying
That's exactly what I'm saying
That's exactly what I'd say
That's not what I'm afraid of
That's how I feel right now
That's all I need for now
That's all the reason I need
That's all the thanks I need
That's exactly what I needed
That's not what I had in mind
That's not quite what I meant
That's precisely what I meant
That's the choice I made
That's all I need to know
That's all I needed to know
That's really all I know
That's not the way I see it
That's not how I remember it
That isn't the way I heard it
That wasn't what I intended
That's all I need to hear
That's all I wanted to hear
That's not what I just heard
That's not where I'm going
That's all I was waiting for
That's not what I'm here for
That doesn't change how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly what I expect
That's more than I expected
That's not what I meant either
That's all I'm trying to do
That's not what I was doing
That's the best I can do
That's all I'm thinking about
That's when I injured my ankle
That's how I injured my ankle
That's why I've done all this
That's why I went to Boston
That's where Tom and I met
That's where I went yesterday
That's the reason I'm here
That's not how I would say it
That's how I would've done it
That's how I planned it
How do I get a hold of you?
How do these things work?
How do you know it's true?
How do we reason with Tom?
How do you put up with Tom?
How do you spend your time?
How do you live like this?
How do I explain this?
How do we explain this?
How do you explain all this?
How do you remember that?
How do you prove that?
How do you even know that?
How do you plan on doing that?
How do you intend to do that?
How do you propose to do that?
How do you propose we do that?
How do you want me to do that?
How do you know what I said?
How do you know it's not real?
How do you know it's real?
How do I know this is real?
How do I get out of this mess?
How do you plan to help me?
How do you know where I live?
How do you know I don't know?
How do you put up with it?
How do you want to handle it?
How do you explain it?
How do you always do it?
How do you intend to do it?
How does Tom jump so high?
How do you stand this heat?
How do you know what I heard?
How do you know what I had?
How do you know where to go?
How do you think I felt?
How do we open this door?
How do you want to die?
How do you stand this cold?
How do you know who I am?
Don't give up hope
What are you studying about?
Don't look back
What is he learning?
You can't make me love you
Tom said he'd kill you
Tom said he'd call you
Tom isn't as tall as you
Hasn't Tom arrived yet?
You look fine, Tom
Tom's birthday is today
Tom's phone is ringing
That's why Tom quit
Tom's family is missing
Tom said you'd phone me
That's up to Tom, not me
Should I let Tom kiss me?
Tom says he'll hurt me
That's between Tom and me
Does Tom still love Mary?
Tom's feelings are hurt
Tom's prints are on the gun
That's why Tom died
Tom's wife just died
Tom's body was cremated
Tom's mood has changed
That's why Tom came
It'll be fine, Tom
It's just a storm
I don't have time to talk
What's wrong with her?
Why does she do that?
That's a weird sentence
Don't give in to Tom's demands
I'm doing the right thing
Is Mary prettier than me?
We don't need you anymore
Haven't you eaten lunch yet?
Haven't you eaten lunch?
When did you quit smoking?
That's what I wrote
That's what's got me worried
That's where I work
That's a lot of work
That's what I wanted
That's all I wanted
That's all I ever wanted
That's what I'd want
That's kind of vague
That's simply not true
That's not really true
That's an ugly tie
That's what I think
That's a good thing
That's a very nice suit
That's a long story
That's a good story
That's a good start
That's a nice skirt
That's a very good sign
That's a real long shot
That's a good school
That's not for me to say
That's all you ever say
That's all I want to say
That's all I had to say
That's all I can say
That's against the rules
That's kind of rude
That's a lot to remember
That's a huge relief
That's a good reason
That's kind of rare
That's all I can promise
That's a brilliant plan
That's a generous offer
That's all over now
That's sort of nice
That's what makes me nervous
That's all I needed
That's a pretty necklace
That's my real name
That's a great name
That's a great movie
That's a cool motorcycle
That's what I meant
That's what's worrying me
That's what terrifies me
That's what interests me
That's not what worries me
That's not going to stop me
That's enough for me
That wouldn't help me
That hadn't occurred to me
That doesn't make sense to me
That didn't even occur to me
That could've hit me
That ball could've hit me
That's a blatant lie
That can't be legal
That's why I'm late
That's nice to know
That's a nice jacket
That's why I did it
That's more like it
That's how I see it
That's how I did it
That isn't much, is it?
That's not the issue
That's not how it is
That's a wonderful idea
That's a crazy idea
That's a clever idea
That's our best hope
That's a lot of help
That's what I heard
That's nice to hear
That's good to hear
That's my best guess
That's a good guess
That's not very good
That's a pretty girl
That's a great gift
That'll be a lot of fun
That's all I can ask for
That's all I could find
That's a bit extreme
That's a lame excuse
That's a nice dress
That's already been done
That's kind of deep
That's for me to decide
That's what's driving me crazy
That's kind of cool
That's a lot to consider
That's a very nice coat
That's a lot of cash
That's a police car
That's why I called
That's a good brand
That wasn't too bad
That's a fair assumption
That's all I can ask
Is that OK?
Have you got an appointment?
I don't have classes
You didn't go there
So, why are you here?
So, what can I do for you?
Do you know about mine ?
Do we have free will?
Don't state the obvious
Have you ever driven manual?
Where is your bedroom?
We're going to visit the Sun
But in the cool of evening!
Don't even say that as a joke
I'd like to be more like you
I'd like to take a walk
I'd like to sing you a song
I'd like to order a pizza
I'd like to shake your hand
I'd like to own a business
No matter what, don't tell Tom
It's a matter of taste
It's a matter of survival
It's a matter of priorities
It's a matter of principle
I'd rather do this alone
I'd rather do this by myself
I've already tried that once
When did you become a teacher?
Tom isn't wearing a name tag
Mary's lipstick is smeared
Is this some kind of joke?

We've had a very good year
We've been told to do that
We've all done that before
We need to do that by 2:30
We didn't have enough time
We can't understand French
Those aren't my sunglasses
They haven't done that yet
They aren't doing that yet
There's nowhere else to go
Tom and I got divorced in 2013
There's no way I'd do that
The noise didn't bother me
That'll be very easy to do
Should I do that right now?
Our strategy isn't working
Our situation isn't unique
October 20th was a hot day
My mother didn't like dogs
Tom admitted he didn't do that
Tom's trial started on Monday
Tom's singing voice isn't bad
Tom's house is on Park Street
My grades haven't improved
Tom's first wife was Canadian
Tom's bad ear is his left one

It's snowing now in Boston
Tom won't likely be back soon
It's raining now in Boston
Tom won't likely be awake yet
It's easy to get to Boston
Tom won't likely be awake now
It's almost time for lunch
Tom won't like our doing that
It's a method worth trying
Tom won't do that if it rains
It's a bad idea to do that
Tom won't be doing that again
It's your duty to do that
It'll be tiring to do that
It wasn't easy to get here
Is it safe to do that here?
Is it all right to do that?
Is it OK if I speak French?
I've never used a chainsaw
I've just bought a new car
I've done that once before
I've considered doing that

I'll do that tomorrow, too
I'll do that if you pay me
I'll be back in three days
I'd like to buy some pears
I'd like a chocolate shake
I'd like 300 grams of this
I wouldn't mind doing that
Tom usually does that at 2:30
I won't promise to do that
I won't do that any longer
I won't come to your party
I wish I hadn't gone there
I wish I hadn't eaten that
Tom told me that he's thirsty
I wish I hadn't drunk that

Tom told me that he's retired
Tom told me that he's puzzled
Tom told me that he's pleased
Tom told me that he's nervous
I wasn't wearing a uniform
Tom told me that he's jealous
I wasn't totally surprised
Tom told me that he'd be fair
I wasn't telling the truth
I wasn't seriously injured
Tom told me that I'm forgiven
I wasn't here this morning
Tom told me that I'm annoying
I wasn't at home yesterday
Tom told me he'd go to Boston
Tom told me he didn't do that
Tom thinks he's a good driver
Tom still hasn't eaten dinner
Tom shouldn't have left early
Tom shouldn't do that anymore
Tom should've locked the door
Tom should've been suspicious
Tom should've been reasonable
Tom should've been interested
I thought you weren't busy
Tom should've been helping us
I thought that I'd do that

Tom said he shouldn't do that
Tom said he didn't have a job
Tom said he didn't have a dog
Tom said I wasn't good enough
I know what it's all about
I know what I'm up against
I know this isn't any good
I know that you don't care
I know that I'm overweight
I know it's more than that
Tom promised he'd check on it
Tom promised he won't do that
I know how much it'll cost
Tom probably isn't hungry yet
Tom probably isn't afraid now
I know I'm partly to blame
I know I'd hate to do that
I know I shouldn't do that
I know I shouldn't be here
I know I can't be replaced
I hope you'll do that soon
I hope that'll happen soon
I hope it's worth the wait
Tom needs to be ready by 2:30
I haven't changed my plans
Tom must've wanted to do that
I guess I'd rather do that
I expect that I'll do that
I don't want to see anyone
Tom likely won't be impressed
I don't want to play poker

They don't want to see me
These glasses aren't mine
These don't belong to me
The snow isn't letting up
That's what I want to eat

Make sure you do that, OK?
Tom still hasn't answered me
Let's go out on the porch
Tom still can't speak French
It's your turn to do that
It's way past my bed time
It's too early to do that
Tom should've been terrified
It's necessary to do that
Tom should've been suspended
It's important to do that
Tom should've been surprised
It's humid here in Boston
Tom should've been skeptical
It's foggy here in Boston
Tom should've been impressed
It's dangerous to do that
Tom should've been a teacher
It's almost time to leave
It's all right to do that
It'll be risky to do that
It'll be cheap to do that
It wasn't me who did that
Is it humid now in Boston?
Is it foggy now in Boston?

I wish I hadn't been late
Tom promised he'd be on time
Tom probably won't be asleep

Tom must've done that by now
Tom must've been very scared
I want to go, but I can't
Tom must've been very afraid
Tom must've been heartbroken
Tom must've been embarrassed
Tom must've been discouraged
I think it's too late now
I still haven't graduated
Tom likes beef and I do, too
Tom likely won't be prepared
I shouldn't spend so much
I shouldn't need any help
I shouldn't do that today
I shouldn't do that again
I shouldn't be here today

I might go to Boston, too
I know what's in your bag
I know time's running out
I know there's work to do
I know that I'm not ready
I know that I'm conceited
I know it's time to leave
I know I've said too much

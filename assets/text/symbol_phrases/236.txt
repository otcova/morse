We're still digging
We're short of food
We're on full alert
We're not squatters
We're not buying it
We're like a family
We're breaking even
We'll never go away
That's when I met Tom
It's too late for Tom
We don't feel safer
We don't believe it
We can't pay for it
How will Tom cope now?
How long can Tom last?
How can Tom know that?
Did you kiss Tom back?
Did Tom have a stroke?
Can we take Tom alive?
They're fixing that
They're all at risk
Can anybody blame Tom?
Will Tom take action?
Who knew Tom painted?
Who doesn't love Tom?
What if Tom is alive?
Tom, you're a genius
Tom, you astonish me
Is the roof shingled?
They're my books
Give me the magazine, please
Tom, what do you say?
The task isn't easy
Tom, what can you do?
The task isn't done
Tom's voice was calm
Tom's mouth was full
Tom won't name names
That's what we have
That's what we felt
That's what happens
That's what dogs do
That's the sad part
That's the goal now
That's the fun part
That's the end goal
Tom wasn't a servant
That's the best bet
That's the bad news
That's pure rubbish
That's our position
That's our criteria
That's our approach
That's not quite it
That's not my point
That's no longer so
That's my objective
That's my complaint
That's my challenge
That's all past now
That's all gone now
That's a nice touch
That's a great sign
That's a cold place
That's a big fat no
That didn't stop me
That ain't my style
Tom was nice-looking
So how do you do it?
So how can we do it?
Should we be silent?
Should I keep going?
OK, that settles it
Let's pick a winner
Let's clear this up
Let's clear the air
Just don't go crazy
It's too big for me
It's hard to let go
It's bigger than us
It's been wonderful
It's been very hard
It's been fantastic
It's a slow process
It's a safety issue
It's a rare disease
It's a package deal
It's a nice feeling
It's a long process
It's a great excuse
It's a good program
It's a good concept
It's a funny market
It's a free service
It's a crying shame
It's a cry for help
It's OK to admit it
It'll still be good
It'll be very tough
It'll be a big flop
It won't make sense
It wasn't easy work
It wasn't always so
Tom must've been ill
It just doesn't fit
Tom isn't hiding out
Is this a good move?
Is this a bad dream?
Is there more to do?
Is that your advice?
Is it entirely over?
I've used it myself
I've done it myself
I've been in prison
I'm upset at myself
I'm truly horrified
I'm too competitive
I'm tall and skinny
I'm taking a chance
I'm still on a call
I'm so disappointed
I'm really prepared
I'm ready to answer
I'm quite confident
I'm praying for you
I'm over it already
I'm not touching it
I'm not paying this
I'm in good company
I'm fit and healthy
I'm cheating on you
I'm about to scream
I'll save the world
I'd better get busy
I wasn't used to it
I swear it's not me
I knew we'd be good
I haven't tested it
Tom hasn't been seen
I haven't seen that
I don't win anymore
I don't smoke crack
I don't play sports
I don't mind losing
I don't feel normal
I didn't learn much
I couldn't leave it
I can't pay it back
I can't count on it
I can't be with you
I ain't got all day
Tom didn't elaborate
How would that feel?
How were they found?
How twisted is that?
How strange is that?
How should I put it?
How perfect is that?
Let Tom go, will you?
How does life start?
How do people do it?
Just how good is Tom?
How could they tell?
How about your wife?
I don't like paying taxes
How about some eggs?
How about right now?
Is Tom right for you?
History doesn't lie
Here's what I wrote
Is Tom going to live?
Is Tom going on tour?
Good luck, you guys
I'm going to hit Tom
Get a room, you two
I think I'm over Tom
Dragons don't exist
I kissed Mary's neck
Don't stop learning
I felt Tom's sadness
Don't miss this one
Don't make me dance
I'm not annoying anyone
I don't think...
Then you shouldn't talk.
I can't surf
I can't snowboard
Who did you go surfing with?
My legs feel like Jell-O
Don't break his heart
Don't break her heart
Tom's pupils are dilated
I'm sorry
I didn't hear you
I'm sorry
I didn't hear you
Maybe they're friends
They don't like to dance
Wait, did you say girlfriend?
Or, boyfriend?
I've totally forgotten
Sorry, did you wait long?
I think it's time to run
It was really soft!
His opinion didn't matter
How much do you like her?
Have you got time?
I'll be waiting at Berlin
So that's what you think
Don't just leave it
Don't give up, ever
Does anyone know Tom?
Don't get defensive
Don't fall for that
Do you want Tom back?
Do you like guitars?
Do you have an iPad?
Bring me a fork, Tom
Do you have a dream?
What's left for Tom?
Can you settle this?
Can you afford them?
What makes Tom tick?
Can I wash my hands?
What did Tom invent?
Boy were they wrong!
Are you wealthy yet?
Tom, you're a prude
Are we your enemies?
Anybody want to bet?
Tom's shift is over
Anybody got a hanky?
You're never alone
You're just a snob
You wanted to talk?
Tom wasn't deterred
You can't avoid it
Will it get better?
Why waste our time?
Why so much hoopla?
Why did I say that?
Why cause an issue?
Who was the victim?
Who wants this job?
Who should get one?
Who do I look like?
Who brought you in?
Where will that be?
Where did it start?
Where are the hats?
When is moving day?
When can you do it?
What's their value?
What's the process?
What's left behind?
What's in your car?
What would you get?
What were we to do?
What should you do?
What prompted that?
What good was that?
What did ours cost?
What can stop them?
Well, let's try it
We've held our own
We've heard it all
We've all moved on
We're still at war
We're partners now
We're on track now
We're on a mission
We're human beings
We're all fired up
We won't be judged
We won't back down
We mustn't do that
We just can't quit
Tom made a 911 call
We don't want pork
We don't know that
We don't accept it
We didn't get that
We couldn't go out
We can't lose hope
We can't help that
This won't go away
Tom isn't with them
Tom isn't buying it
This isn't all bad
This isn't a fluke
Tom isn't all there
Tom isn't a recluse
Tom is sharp-witted
They're our heroes
They're only ideas
They're miles away
They won't tell us
Tom is dark-skinned
That's pretty cold
That's not any fun
That's normal here
That's no easy job
That's no accident
That's just no fun
That's hard to get
That's good for us
That's easy enough
That's a done deal
That'll come later
That'll be the day
It's an unpredictable market
Did I lose a lot?
I needlessly prepared?
Music doesn't know borders
I'm begging you, don't be mad
Take the watering-can with you
Have you seen an eagle ?
Look!
An abelia!
Look an apricot tree!
Look, a Japanese apricot tree!
Look an acacia!
Look a rose acacia!
Look a mahogany!
Look an acerola!
Look, an acokanthera!
Look an adenia!
Look an adenium!
Look an agave!
Look an ailanthus!
Look a lowbush cranberry!
That hasn't helped
Maybe that'll work
Tom doesn't do that
Maybe it's just me
Let's not be catty
Let's do it anyway
Tom didn't call 911
Let's be real here
Tom didn't back off
It's unrecoverable
It's time to do it
It's really a must
It's our last hope
It's nothing major
It's not too fancy
It's just business
It's getting to me
It's disappointing
It's been horrible
It's a great start
It's a bit extreme
It'll be invisible
Is that Tom's fault?
I'm praying for Tom
How did Tom blow it?
Does Tom make money?
Who speaks for Tom?
Who is Tom, anyway?
What does Tom know?
It isn't just that
Tom wasn't so sure
Is this too sloppy?
Is this too little?
Is that too little?
Is that a definite?
Is it a pipe dream?
I've seen too much
I've been arrested
I'm working harder
I'm thrilled to go
I'm supposed to go
I'm still positive
I'm still learning
I'm not hoofing it
I'm not frustrated
I'm just different
I'm in great shape
I'm going to vomit
I'm going to relax
I'm going to fight
I'm getting poorer
I'm fine with this
I'm fine with that
I'm feeling a buzz
I'm fairly pleased
I'm considering it
I'm buying a puppy
I'm back to normal
I'm all for change
I'm alive and well
I'm a mature adult
I'll stay involved
I'll read anything
I'll leave you now
I would've done it
I wasn't born rich
Tom isn't sure yet
Tom isn't sure why
Tom isn't employed
Tom isn't a slouch
I don't want money
I don't think that
I don't smoke weed
I don't sell drugs
I don't believe so
I didn't play well
I didn't look back
I can't walk alone
I can't live there
How will you fight?
How unfair is that?
How stupid is that?
How lucky was that?
How does hail form?
How did you manage?
Tom hasn't yet won
How did tonight go?
How can you retire?
Tom hasn't won yet
Here's what I mean
Here's what I know
Have you ever lost?
Don't you get that?
Does anyone get it?
Do I look paranoid?
Did you feel happy?
Can you support me?
Can they do better?
Can anyone comment?
Can I do that here?
Are you that dense?
Are you all morons?
Tom didn't survive
Are we bad parents?
Am I going to jail?
Tom didn't look OK
You're just wrong
You're famous now
Tom didn't get far
You're all prudes
Tom didn't do well
Why not apologize?
Why did they meet?
Who wants a treat?
Who pays for what?
Who can I yell at?
Where's my refund?
What's it all for?
What troubles you?
What song is this?
What show is this?
What am I getting?
Were you a tomboy?
We've wronged you
We've had a blast
We're not closing
We're good enough
We're crowded now
We won't see them
So, who killed Tom?
We hope it'll end
I'm voting for Tom
I like Tom's style
We can't fail now
Here's Tom's reply
Who's Tom Jackson?
What does Tom say?
They're all jerks
Tom wasn't famous
That's no defense
That's my feeling
Tom was fast, too
So, why change it?
Now let's move on
Let's not quibble
Let's not blow it
It's truly tragic
It's not about us
It's my lucky day
It's long overdue
It's ideal for us
It's been amazing
It's all good fun
It's a tough call
It's a lot to ask
It doesn't add up
It ain't over yet
Is your bank safe?
Is there a heaven?
Is nothing sacred?
I've been elected
I'm still on edge
I'm ready to vote
I'm not the devil
I'm not switching
I'm in a real fix
I'm having a baby
I'm aware of this
I'll live with it
I'll do as I like
I'll buy the beer
I'd wear a helmet
I'd say thank you
I'd love to coach
I think that's it
I think it's huge
I started in 2013
Tom couldn't move
I know it's early
I guess I'll live
Sweet dreams, Tom
I didn't catch it
I saw Tom's house
I can't take this
I can't stop here
I can't sit still
I love Tom's eyes
How would we know?
How tough is this?
How legal is that?
How green are you?
How great is that?
Can Tom come back?
How can this work?
Here's one reason
What if Tom wins?
Don't be provoked
Do you feel happy?
Do you ever teach?
Do I get overtime?
Can't you lift me?
Are you my cousin?
You're repulsive
Would it help me?
Will you sell it?
Why did we leave?
Why all the fuss?
Who would buy it?
When did we meet?
What's it really?
What might it be?
What makes it go?
What if it leaks?
What do you love?
What comes first?
What can it hurt?
We're not saints
We're all for it
We're against it
We can't get out
We aren't so bad
They're so right
They'll kill you
OK, you're wrong
OK, you're right
OK, wish me luck
OK, thanks again
OK, thanks a lot
OK, listen to me
Tom isn't losing
OK, let's go now
OK, let me drive
Tom isn't Jewish
OK, I'll shut up
OK, I understand
OK, I heard that
Let's join hands
Is your son here?
Is today the day?
Is this not true?
Is there no hope?
Is that too many?
Is that my rifle?
Is that for real?
I've had a blast
I'm very hopeful
I'm not an actor
I'm just worried
I'm clearing out
I'm always eager
I'm almost there
I'm a lot better
I'll support you
I'll return soon
How true is this?
How true is that?
How safe is safe?
How easy is this?
Tom can't be ill
How easy is that?
How do we manage?
How do they cope?
Hope hasn't died
Do you regret it?
Do things change?
Is Tom breathing?
Can we be honest?
Are you retarded?
Are you my mommy?
Are you ignorant?
Did Tom ever win?
Are you employed?
What'll Tom win?
Who should vote?
What do you bid?
What did I know?
There's no work
That's real big
Need I say more?
It's too simple
It's still good
It's still cool
It's pretty fun
It's our system
It's not simple
It'll pass soon
I'm proud of it
Can you proceed?
Aren't we going?
Any suggestions?
Who was better?
Who wants what?
Tom can't count
Was I too loud?
That's fixable
OK, I'll do it
It's not ideal
Don't cheat us
Do I look nice?
Why be afraid?
Who lost face?
Hello, I'm Tom
After you, Tom
It's absurd
Is it tasty?
He doesn't admit his defeat
Thank you, my friends
Calm down, guys
Yes, I'm the wife
Haha, sorry, sorry.
Are you really sorry?
Where did it go wrong?
Didn't you see her there?
Who's on diet?
Can I offer you anything else?
Here's what I learned
Did Tom say he drank that?
Here's what I'm doing
How does Tom plan to help?
How big a deal was it?
I didn't ask Tom for help
It doesn't cost anything
You did not.
Okay then.
How much does it hurt?
Is this good or bad?
Is she in a good mood?
How could you help me?
I didn't want to help Tom
How difficult is that?
I knew Tom couldn't dance
How should it be done?
I know Tom didn't do this
Is it OK to sing here?
Is it worth it to you?
Where does Tom study?
Is this a fraction?
Is this an integer?
Is this a real number?
Is this a natural number?
That's my favorite expression
It's just smoke and mirrors
You don't eat bananas?
Is someone calling me?
I'd never do what Tom did
That isn't Tom's suitcase
At what time are we leaving?
What time are we leaving?
When are we leaving?
What time will we leave?
When will we leave?
Can you repeat it please?
Who's the last one?
Betty" is just a pseudonym
That isn't Tom's trombone
Life isn't always fun
Did Tom take last week off?
Life still isn't easy
For now, Tom can stay here
Alright, how about her ?
Is she?
Hasn't Tom seen her?
Tom won't have seen us
Had Tom seen you last week?
Tom says that he's met you
She's autistic
Do you sell mineral water?
It only lasts 15 minutes, no?
I'll be gone for the weekend
I'll be gone this weekend
I'll be gone by the weekend
I'll be gone until Sunday
I'll be gone by then
I'm off on weekends
There's a package for you
You're delirious
Nobody's laughing now
I'll never doubt Tom again
We'll have to wait for Tom
I can't log in to my account
We're lucky Tom isn't here
Please don't blame me
That just isn't right
Have you ever sung with Tom?
How did Tom get you to help?
That wasn't discussed
How does Tom intend to help?
Are you trying to set us up?
Do they know about each other?
I'll sleep when I'm dead
It's not a zero-sum game
I'm sick and tired of this
Tom's parents freaked out
Why shouldn't I kiss her?
Why shouldn't I kiss him?
Tom touched Mary's shoulder
Don't worry
I didn't kiss her
Don't do this
You'll regret it
Hurry up, will you?
My first name isn't Tom
This isn't good news
Why shouldn't I kiss Tom?
I think you shouldn't kiss Tom
Tom should've known this
I won't drink anything
Tom won't be tired
Will it be an easy class?
No, it is the hardest class!
Are you crazy or just stupid?
Why don't you ask Tom?
I won't do it anymore
I won't fall for it this time
I don't normally wear skirts
It's not a skirt
It's a kilt
They're getting married
How does gravity work?
That's a good picture
I can't picture Tom dancing
That's a pretty dress
I don't think Tom was happy
That's a touchy issue
It's really, really strange
It's really strange
Tom's mother was aghast
Didn't you read the sign?
My name's Ricardo
Oh, what a beautiful doll!
It's painful to be rejected
We weren't passing notes
I can't speak for anyone else
What are you hiding from us?
I'm a European
I'm European
I'm from North America
I'm from South America
I'm from Asia
I'm from Africa
I'm not from Europe
I'm not from Africa
I'm not from Asia
I'm not from Australia
I've never lived in Australia
I'm from Latin America
That's irrelevant now
That's not our policy
What's the address?
There's one right behind you!
I'm a carpenter
Honey doesn't spoil
That's not the reason
That's pretty amazing
That's pretty obvious
I'm not saying Tom is right
I can vouch for Tom's work
That's pretty special
I've been asked to help Tom
That's pretty typical
If I were Tom, I'd sue them
How long have I slept?
Oh wow!
He's your boyfriend.
Do you want to share with me?
Look!
Love, you're gonna kill me
Love, you're going to kill me
I don't have a library card
How do I get a library card?
What's this town like?
What's this city like?
Can you show me around town?
Tom thinks it's me
It's the truth, I swear
That's pretty unusual
That's quite a luxury
Ask Tom when he'll come back
We're still too young to drink
That's really special
How did Tom get Mary to help?
We're staying at another hotel
That's totally normal
How does Tom plan to help us?
We're not all old like you are
That's totally untrue
We're never going to get there
You're the only person I trust
Oh, grandma, how I love you!
You're so nice!
That's unprecedented
And it's not an abstraction
That's very, very sad
Perhaps that's our fate
Mosquitos don't respect walls
The gun wasn't loaded
I wish you could've seen Tom
We haven't talked about it yet
We don't have a moment to lose
That's very difficult
That's very dishonest
That's very, very odd
Why did you turn it off?
I'll rub your back
Tom's parents are immigrants
Tom's wife left him
Is that what you wanted?
A coffee, please.
We didn't recognize each other
We're extremely proud of Tom
We didn't have time to do that
This hasn't been easy
We're going to see Tom again
We're still ahead of schedule
Were you really angry?
We're not talking about today
What's in your wallet?
Did Tom really dance with you?
Why did you turn off the TV?
Why did you turn the TV off?
We're leaving in five minutes
Where are your gloves?
Did you have a fight with Tom?
We won't have class next week
Where's my microphone?
Did you really dance with Tom?
Who asked you to sing?
Do you like the way Tom sings?
Would you sing for me?
Do you think I still love Tom?
You can't beat everyone
Does Tom put sugar in his tea?
Wake me around seven o'clock
Did you enjoy the exhibition?
You know I can't sing
How do you happen to know Tom?
You know I won't sing
You'll both be missed
It didn't last long at all
We can't allow that to happen
You're not very smart
I can't trust Tom with my car
You're often confused
I didn't expect that from Tom
We're very grateful for that
You're making me nervous
He won't take no for an answer
She has her mother's eyes
He has his father's eyes
Could he be Tom's son?
Could she be Tom's daughter?
I'll try to fix it
I'll try to repair it
Your French isn't bad
We're both telling the truth
I guess that's what Tom wants
We shouldn't do this anymore
Can I get a refund now?
Can't someone fix this?
Come on, give it a try
Come on, you can do it
Do you want me to sing?
Did you hear the lion roar?
Don't be such a crybaby!
Don't be so judgmental
We certainly can't blame you
We can't continue doing this
Here's what I've found
We're lucky it's not Monday
How can people help us?
We're going to pay for this
If I could go, I would
I think Tom must've done that
Who is holding the torch?
I'm learning Frisian
I'm learning Cantonese
I'm learning Mandarin
I'm learning Swedish
I'm learning Norwegian
I'm learning Icelandic
I'm learning Serbian
I'm learning Bulgarian
I'm learning Hungarian
I'm learning Russian
I'm learning Portuguese
I'm learning Occitan
I'm learning Catalan
I'm learning Danish
I'm learning Swahili
I'm learning Romanian
I'm learning Greek
I'm learning Latin
I'm learning Ancient Greek
I'm learning Modern Greek
So really, doing it can't hurt
You're a sick bastard
Let's ditch this joint
We won't sharpen the knives
Let's ditch this bozo
Where are you in the picture?
I'm learning Coptic
I'm learning Egyptian
I'm learning Quechua
I'm learning Nahuatl
I'm learning Maori
I'm learning Hawaiian
I'm learning Navajo
I'm learning Cherokee
I'm learning Ojibwe
I'm learning Sardinian
It's very far away
I'm leaving
I'm learning Akkadian
I'm learning Sumerian
I'm learning Hittite
Promise me you'll sing
We should do that here, too
That surprised me, too
Well, I really must go
I'm fortunate compared to Tom
You can't make me sing
I'm going home to be with Tom
Do you think I can help?
I'm tired of listening to Tom
We haven't thought about it
Isn't this what Tom asked for?
We can't leave it like that
Here's a letter for you
Do you think it's a fair law?
Do you want to join my group?
I didn't read it!
I haven't read it!
Hey, what are you doing?
We're running out of ideas
How can I possibly help?
We'll have to do that, too
How come you don't help?
That's a risk Tom had to take
We'd better not get caught
How do you plan to help?
That's a risk Tom has to take
That's exactly what Tom wants
It's my duty to do that
Let's not sing any more
We won't start till Tom comes
I'm just trying to be helpful
Let's walk to the beach
We wouldn't want to scare Tom
Were you alone all week?
We'll see Tom sooner or later
We're all here except for Tom
Open your books at page 42
Will you help me, Tom?
No, not again
Ask someone else!
Why are you doing this for me?
Did you say you would go?
Who knows what Tom looks like?
Don't ask me not to sing
Why did Tom get into that car?
Don't start cheering yet
Why did Tom go to the station?
We can't let you sing here
Why should Tom sing that song?
We're in really bad shape
We'll see you next Monday
You've kept your promise
Did you dance by yourself?
Do you think I could help?

Tom said he doesn't feel well
We'll be there to support you
We'll just have to start over
We're all part of the problem
We're both really competitive
We're doing phenomenally well
We're facing serious problems
We're going back to our hotel
We're going to do it properly
We're going to have more rain
We're going to need them both
We're just having a good time
We're just not used to it yet
We don't need anybody else
Go and talk to her, Tom
What are you afraid of?
Tom's still eating
Man's power is knowledge
I'm a child in a man's body
I am a child in a man's body
We're not satisfied with that
We're not where we want to be
We're pleased with the result
We're real excited about that
We've already waited too long
Can I make you a proposal?
We've always been competitive
We've been here since October
We've corrected the situation
We've done what we came to do
We've got a lot of confidence
We've got no plans to do that
We've got to start doing that
We've got too much work to do
We've never seen any of those
We've talked a lot about this
Don't let your muscles atrophy
We've talked about that a lot
We've waited too long already
Why does Tom have to do that?
What time do we get to Boston?
Who runs faster, Tom or Mary?
When are you going to do that?
Who knows where Tom was born?
Who did you go to Boston with?
We haven't seen Tom in weeks
You sure are busy, aren't you?
You're much smarter than I am
We didn't need to buy anything
Tom wouldn't let us help him
We didn't need to pay anything
We don't have much flexibility
Yes, Tom actually said that
We have lots of questions, too
He's here
Sit back, relax and enjoy
Just sit back, relax and enjoy
We have until 2:30 p.m
We haven't finished doing that
We haven't had that happen yet
We haven't made a decision yet
We just can't take that chance
We just couldn't find anything
We just didn't want to do that
We just don't have enough time
That's a sight for sore eyes
Tom said he didn't kiss Mary
We know it's not going to work
Tom never would've done that
We know we're better than that
Is your dad here?
Is your mom here?
Your sentence is 95% correct.
Tom needs a driver's license
We know we've got big problems
We know what you're capable of
We know what's going to happen
Will you see Tom next month?
Who knows when Tom was born?
Who is younger, Tom or Mary?
Who is heavier, Tom or Mary?
Tom, there's a call for you
Tom's mother is calling him
Tom's dog killed Mary's cat
Tom works for Mary's father
Tom won't play tennis today
Tom won't escape punishment
Tom won't call this evening
Thanks for your support!
Tom didn't kiss me
Did Tom really just say that?
Tom is your son, too
I worry about Tom, too
What makes you think I am God?
This is my mother's restaurant
We should've been more focused
There’s still much more to do
What was his talk about?
What was her talk about?
Tom weighs about 300 pounds
Tom wasn't at all satisfied
He'd do anything for you
She'd do anything for you
Tom wasn't a bright student
We weren't given a fair chance
We weren't given food or water
We'd be crazy not to advertise
Tom wants to thank you, too
We'd better get it out of here
We'll all have to wait and see
We'll assist in any way we can
We'll be here for another week
We'll be there waiting for you
Tom usually gets up at 6:30
We'll never forget what we saw
We're aware of what's going on
We're doing what we love to do
We're doing what we want to do
We're done answering questions
We're going to be working late
We're going to have a good day
We're going to miss doing this
We're going to wait in the car
We're not open on Thanksgiving
Tom should've worked harder
We're not sure what's going on
Tom should've been an actor
We're planning to do just that
We don't have time to hesitate
I'll take the shortest route
Tom should've been a lawyer
We're trying as hard as we can
We're trying our best to do it
We're trying to think positive
Tom should be there by 2:30
We've always been good friends
We've an obligation to do that
You're free to leave now
She's not all that gorgeous
I'm doing a tour of the city
It's quite ironic
How has your day been?
Did you get stuck in traffic?
We've got to be ready for that
We've got to do that on Monday
We've gotten pretty good at it
We've just got to do something
We've just got to keep working
Tom said he didn't see Mary
We've known this for some time
We've read what you've written
These shoes don't fit
Smile!
On my honour!
Has the plaster set?
Was my sentence incorrect?
Or inelegant?
Or both?
Or neither one nor the other?
You'd be a fool not to do that
Tom must've had an accident
When they go low, we go high
Tom likes jazz, but I don't
Tom likes jazz, and so do I
Tom likes Mary, and so do I
Have the neighbors complained?
You shouldn't laugh at Tom
Tom's room is full of toys
Tom won't be back tomorrow
Tom will go, too, won't he?
Tom went to Boston in 2013
Tom wasn't there last week
Tom wasn't able to do that
Tom tried hard, but failed
I can't compete with this
Scream a bit quieter!
What makes America America?
Should one say "thou" or "ye"?
I'm making popcorn
I'm making popcorn
Do you want some?
Good afternoon everybody!
Let's rejoice
I was flying, like the wind
Tom probably won't do that
Tom must've been home then
Tom didn't like the taste much
Tom lived in Boston, right?
You'll soon hear from Tom
You shouldn't talk to Tom
Why does Tom call me Mary?
Who is taller, you or Tom?
We don't owe Tom anything
We didn't need Tom's help
What is he going to do?
What is she going to do?
He's such a snob
She's such a snob
They're such snobs
I'm a snob
I'm a snob, and proud of it

I'm not racist, but..
It's my favorite language
That's my favorite language

That's his favorite language
It's his favorite language
It's her favorite language
She's itching to dance
What time is it in Paris now?
What did they look like?
They're racists

It's a curious coincidence
Are you and Tom friends?
Tom isn't easy to impress
I can't find the printer
Where is the printer?
Where can I buy printers?
Did you break them?
Did you steal them?
When did you buy them?
How dare you call me poor?
How dare you call me a racist?
How dare you call me stupid?
Go away: I'm working
May I cuddle you?
I haven't cleared their fields
You may say that it's shit
That's no skin off my back
That's water off a duck's back
That's no skin off my nose
That doesn't bother me at all
Without the slightest doubt!
Are you coming?
The food's getting cold
You've done a good job of that
What did Tom give to you?
We've got to contact Tom
Tom's music is beautiful
Tom wasn't his real name
She is my father's sister

Enjoy the little things!
What's it to me?
I didn't even know her name
I didn't even know their names
I didn't even know my name
He didn't even know our names
She didn't even know our names
How tall are they?
Who wants to go shopping?
Always be yourself!
I'm lying in the shade
She's lying in the shade
He's lying in the shade
They're lying in the shade
We're lying in the shade
Are the results good?
Yes, they're excellent.
Where are the computers?
Do the computers work?
Does the keyboard work?
The keyboard doesn't work
Are they all right?
It's Sunday
It's Friday
It's Thursday
It's Tuesday
Tell me who's bothering you
He's got a few rough edges
He's a diamond in the rough
It's roadkill
What is a dialect?
What is a language?
What is science?
What is literature?
I'm not making this up!
I'm going to wash the dishes
Hang on; we're almost there
I don't want her to worry
I don't want him to worry
Who will win this time?
How long have you been there?
Are you chicken, Tom?
This was, of course, a lie
This was, of course, a lie
This isn't like you at all
You over-analyze everything
Chop, chop!
Tom's skin is leathery
Tom killed himself in 2013
I've learned so much from Tom
I won't wear a wig
That was probably Tom's point
I'm really thankful
Everybody likes me, except Tom
Is French difficult?
I don't feel cheated
I should've run away
I asked Tom to be here by 2:30
I expect you're right
I couldn't do anything for Tom
I couldn't wait to talk to Tom
I don't blame Tom for retiring
I think they're liars
I guess you're better than Tom
How far away is the sea?
The zipper won't open
In practice, there is
We're drawing
I'll show it to you
Tell me why you're so upset
It's wobbling
Let people live peacefully!
I'm a football player
I'm not enjoying this
I'm not going to quit
I'm not wearing a wig
I'm ready for a break
I've been quite lucky
I've got a suggestion
I've never been burnt
I couldn't do anything
I don't recommend that
I don't worry about it

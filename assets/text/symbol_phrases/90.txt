Sure.
Are you going to marry her?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Yes.
Is she Algerian?
Yes.
Is she black or white?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Yes.
Is she Algerian.
Yes.
Is she beautiful?
Yes.
More beautiful than me?
Your Romanian girlfriend?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Why did you do that?
Because I can.
Why is that woman crying?
Why is that girl crying?
Are these guys Russian?
Yanni couldn't afford a drink
Yanni's revenue increased
She is his ex-wife
Yanni didn't know it
Yanni dove into Rima's diary
Yanni didn't want to go there
Yanni's voice will be silenced
Yanni increased Rima's stipend
Yanni collected Rima's letters
Yanni saw Rima's paintings
Yanni's work is very good
Yanni's data is encrypted
Yanni talked about Rima's art
Yanni couldn't go outside
Yanni's body was weakened
I'm practicing
We'll get started in a moment
Can you hear me clearly?
Let's give it another try
There's no easy solution
Yanni didn't like Rima at all
I'm a compatibilist
I'm a determinist
This led to a divorce in 2004
Yanni's alcoholism worsened
I'm reloading
I won't shoot you
Where's the safe?
What's the combination?
It isn't nice to hit people
It wasn't Tom who set you up
Will Tom be there?
No, I don't think so.
Tom didn't ask us to do that
How was Tom persuaded to join?
Let's speak correctly
This is Tom's French teacher
Is Tom still doing well?
Was this the man you saw?
Are you still with me?
Are you still on board?
The defense rests, Your Honor
I don't live on Park Street
I'd never work for Tom
Tom said he'd eaten
I knew she'd come back quickly
Can you see him?
Who's he with?
Dream about me!
The boy doesn't have a bike
Take out the trash!
Tom isn't antisocial
Tom's not antisocial
You didn't wash your plate
I'm obviously a cat
The boy doesn't have a bicycle
She's just like us
Tom's just like us
He's not a thief
She's not a thief
Tom's not a thief
Go there!
It wasn't Tom who told me that
Juice, please
Are you proud of your country?
Did the payment go through?
Has the payment gone through?
Who illustrated this book?
Are you being honest with us?
I'm making good progress
I think it's broken
It's in the attic
It's unstable
I loved him, I think
They didn't forget me
She didn't forget me
He didn't forget me
They didn't forget us
She didn't forget us
He didn't forget us
Tom didn't know what happened
Ring as soon as you're ready
Phone as soon as you're ready
As soon as you're ready, ring
As soon as you're ready, phone
Am I normal?
How could you be so callous?
You're the chosen one
You're hard to fool
You're too arrogant
Did he know him?
Why aren't you a Christian?
I'll take the cheapest ones
Don't take the cheapest one
Don't take the cheapest ones
She's a goddess
He doesn't want to obey her
He doesn't want to obey him
Where did you put my book?
It's on the end table.
You're such a mama's boy
She's a queen
He's a queen
What time is sundown?
I didn't know you were gay
I'll make coffee
I didn't spend very much
I didn't spend a lot
That isn't Tom
It's his brother
Tom was dead-set against it
I'm looking it up right now
You're not cool
Here's a crazy idea
Will you be my girlfriend?
You're my friend
Tom's dog is always with Tom
Tom's gay.
What makes you think so?
We were together tonight.
Tom doesn't tan
Tom didn't want to sit by Mary
That's unsanitary
Don't be a mama's boy
It's hidden
It's hidden in the basement
They weren't being supervised
Tom said that he'd eaten
Do you have a business card?
It's speeding up
It's accelerating
There's a draft
I think that it's broken
It's nearly the same
Move your butt!
I can't get through to anybody
That doesn't satisfy me
Mary couldn't have done worse
Are you eligible to vote?
That's a fringe theory
We can't foresee everything
What happened there?
Why such commotion?
Have you ever seen the pier?
How many pull-ups do you do?
It's a truck with a trailer
Why did you latch onto me?
What are you doing?" he fumed
Aren't you leaving tomorrow?
Are you allowed to say that?
Can you say it in Spanish?
When will they pay me?
She's shouting your name
I’m just passing by
We’re just passing by
Tom didn't want me there
Oh, how cute
Is this a question?
Dad, I'm hungry.
Hi, Hungry!
I'm Dad.
We're not good at maths
You're such a Karen
No, it wasn't quite like that
You're all lame
When are you going to Tom's?
When are you driving to Tom's?
Where is it?
It was there earlier.
Where has it gone?
It was there earlier.
You've just been in that shop
Gross!
Get away from me!
I don't exist
When shall I be free?
They're holding Tom prisoner
It'll take me a day to do that
That's a boring tie
I'm not a human being
I can't hold this much longer
Was Tom holding Mary's hand?
I'm not deaf
You don't need to shout
It isn't banal!
It's not banal!
That's not banal!
That's a truism
We've held many events there
Tom caught hold of Mary's hand
Excuse me, hold on a second
We're not middle-aged
What is this?
Nobody says no!
tom doesn't like riding buses
He's doing quite well
Don't call him that!
Stop calling her that!
I'm not that smart
He's not that stupid
She's not that stupid
Tom is not that stupid.
Are you sure?
I couldn't hold on any longer
Yeah, I'm crazy
It's not atypical
You're holding up the line
We don't believe in your god
Why didn't they quote you?
Let's get you dressed
It's not fatal
Who's the owner of the cafe?
What color will it be?
Go for it, and don't hold back
Don't exacerbate the problem
Tom hasn't been online in days
I won't hold that against you
Ask away.
Is he your boyfriend?
Is she your girlfriend?
I'm here as a translator
I'm here as an interpreter
Tom didn't know how to open it
I don't have any baggage
I don't have any luggage
I'm an observer
I'm not saying no
Everything's already closed
Everything's closed already
I'm hauling produce
Tom isn't easily deterred
It's a scientific breakthrough
Do you like ginger?
Do you like ginger ale?
The K9 unit was deployed
You're a liability
Could you hold that thought?
I held on to Tom's sleeve
Do you like ale?
Do you have any wine coolers?
I hate this song!
Then why are you dancing?
We can't hold out much longer
Don't hold your breath on that
I don't want to have dinner
I'll hold the ladder for you
Jugurtha's victory was total
Jugurtha is a Berber name.
No, it's Kabyle.
Still, he is Kabyle!
You're insulting Kabyles!
Insulting Kabyles?
How about that?
Help!
He's trying to kill me!
Help!
You don't have to hold back
How did you get into the room?
Do we have a map?
I don't think she's at home
I don't think she's home
Tom didn't have his helmet on
Is Tom speaking French?
We didn't like anything
Tom's parents speak French
Is that German?
Is that Czech?
Is that Russian?
Is that Ukrainian?
Is the salad tasty?
They're trying the rice
She'll make a salad
She'll prepare a salad
Where's my bow?
Where's my onion?
Who cooked the rice?
Can I have some rice?
I can't have rice
The cheese isn't fresh
They're eaten raw
You'll be held accountable
Did Tom get sick?
Tom, wait!
He doesn't want me anymore
She doesn't want me anymore
I'm never sure of anything
I'm already on the bus
Where's your first aid kit?
I don't eat chocolate
But thanks for the flowers!
I have a built-in webcam
Don't touch this button
When will the funeral be held?
This isn't a one-way street
This is so un-American
Is this Ido?
We're cat moms
I think it should be X, not Y
Tom didn't try to defend Mary
It's three minutes to showtime
At least, I hope it doesn't
It's a fact
Let's get it done!
It's too much for one person
Don't sit down!
Sadly, many people died
Tom is Mary's only hope
What is your son doing?
But I'm bisexual!
When's the next meeting?
I hope it's not on Monday
I hope it'll do some good
Tom?
Tom Jackson?
The very same.
Search the house!
It's a big thing to hope for
Let's hope no one does that
I've been feeling weak
Normal" isn't in my vocabulary
Is that a Berber language?
I feel you, buddy
I weigh 200 pounds
Don't.
Why would she?
Why would he?
Is Tom secretly a robot?
I'm hoping it'll rain
Tom is hoping it won't
Just don't get your hopes up
Tom doesn't want me anymore
You do eat rice, don't you?
We're a lot like them
I'm busy
Don't wait for me if I'm late
Coincidence?
Coincidence?
I think not!
Let's hope nobody does that
Where is Rima from?
She's Russian.
Did he look at me?
Where should I be looking?
Are there many of them there?
Are there a lot of them there?
Did you watch the news today?
I'll tell him about it
You can't leave without paying
Everything.
Including couscous?
Including couscous.
That's the only hope I have
I'm reading the inscription
Is there a leak?
What are we having?
I've never tried maple syrup
Is it vegan?
We both hope that'll happen
We're hoping to change that
Tom didn't pay us very well
He's always late!
Tom, share with your brother
We're filled with hope again
No, Tom
Tom didn't need that much help
Did she talk to you about it?
There's hope for everyone
I'm not worth it
It's clear who the spy is
It's a casus belli
She's washing them
I'm not heterosexual
Have we got a map?
How's Mary's French?
Top-notch!
What's Mary's French like?
Brilliant!
That's not bad as well
That's not bad, either
Tom's bicycle is in the garage
May I come in?
Yes, of course.
May I come in?
Yes, do!
Is one still missing?
Is there one still missing?
Don't rush
It's not desperately urgent
It's not desperately urgent
It's not that urgent
It isn't that urgent
We're all just people
It's a start
It's a start!
We've made a start
They've made a start
Let's finish for today
She's back from Madrid
Who's the mayor?
Who's the mayor now?
I don't have a can opener
Let's buy a bicycle for Tom
Tom can't work in Australia
We're far from the truth
Tom wasn't in the park
She's just an average girl
He's just an average boy
Mary's just an average woman
Tom's just an average man
You can sleep when you're dead
Do you know Yanni's mother?
What is it, Yanni?
Yanni's journey has ended
It's sunny outside
Let's get dressed
Yanni didn't even get dressed
That's what we're hoping to do
I'll sit with Mary
There's hope for the world
She's afraid of me
You're afraid of her
You're afraid of them
She's afraid of him
He's afraid of her
She's afraid of her
He's afraid of you
She's afraid of you
She's afraid of them
They're afraid of her
They're afraid of them
You're afraid of us
He's afraid of us
She's afraid of us
He's afraid of them
We haven't given up hope yet
Let's hope you get lucky
Come on, Rima
Let's dance all fucking night
I'm hoping that's the case
I'm so glad you succeeded
I hope it's not me.
Does Tom miss Mary?
I'm a prostitute
I'm a she-wolf
Tom didn't really like that
Is that a hamster or a gerbil?
All right, I'll let you do it
Did you know Tom was Catholic?
It's grist to his mill
It's all grist to his mill
Don't worry, Mum
Have you asked Mary?
Maybe she's got it.
We've counted them all
He's arriving unannounced
Where does this path lead to?
Where does this path lead?
It's not interesting enough
I'm hot in this coat
What comes afterwards?
What comes after that?
What happens afterwards?
What happens after?
What will happen then?
I'm off again now
I'm going again now
I've got the bolts
Where are the nuts?
Where's the mobile?
He's a footballer
She's a footballer
Scarper!
Where are my keys?
Have you seen my keys?
You look beautiful today.
Thank you.
You're anything but.
Dead doesn’t exist
Tom's room is a mess
NATO can't defend Ukraine
He's wearing a yellow vest
It's a normal human reaction
What do I have to do now?
May I sit here for a while?
Tom didn't take that well
Have you asked Mary?
Maybe she has it.
You mean Tom?
Tom didn't come to the picnic
Tom says he's prepared to die
Why is it so quiet in here?
Is that a hickey on your neck?
How long does a hickey last?
Let's try something
Muiriel is 20 now
The password is "Muiriel
I'm at a loss for words
I just don't know what to say
Is it a recent picture?
This will cost €30
I make €100 a day
That won't happen
I'm going to go
You're so impatient with me
I can't live that kind of life
Most people think I'm crazy
No I'm not; you are!
That's MY line!
He's kicking me!
Are you sure?
Then there is a problem..
Oh, there's a butterfly!
It doesn't surprise me
Are you freaking kidding me?!
I'm so fat
So what?
I'm gonna shoot him
I'm just saying!
That's because you're a girl
I don't intend to be selfish
When I woke up, I was sad
Why do you ask?
I can't tell her now
It's not that simple anymore
How long did you stay?
I didn't like it
That wasn't my intention
Theoretically, I'm doing math
I don't know what you mean
Uh, now it's really weird..
You're really not stupid
What did you answer?
No, he's not my new boyfriend
You never have class or what?!
Where is the problem?
I don't like you anymore
Congratulations!
I don't want to wait that long
Why don't you come visit us?
I shouldn't have logged off
I didn't want this to happen
What other options do I have?
I can't explain it either
How could I be a robot?
Robots don't dream
Don't underestimate my power
You're famous!
What keeps you up so late?
You're not fast enough
Life is hard, but I am harder
Stop it!
I don't speak Japanese
I'm so dumb..
Are you referring to me?
It can't be!
Who is it?
It's your mother.
When will you be back?
It all depends on the weather.
What's going on in the cave?
I'm curious.
I have no idea.
Uh..
How's that working?
You are a coward!
Trust me," he said
The phone is ringing.
I'll get it.
Thank you for helping me.
Don't mention it.
Someday I'll run like the wind
She likes music.
So do I.
Please don't cry
I feel like playing cards.
So do I.
If you don't eat, you die
How do you spell "pretty"?
Why don't we go home?
I'm sorry, I can't stay long
Why aren't you going?
Because I don't want to.
It wasn't me, commissioner!
Oh, my white pants!
You're an angel!
Did you miss me?
Are they all the same?
Thank you very much!
Where are the eggs, please?
I'll take him
It's a surprise
That's a good idea!
Round trip?
Only one-way
It's a pity when somebody dies
Damn!
It's not bad!
Oh, I'm sorry
Do you speak Italian?
May I ask a question?
How do you feel?" he inquired
You'll forget about me someday
I can't live without a TV
Do you have a condom?
May I talk to Ms. Brown?
Ah!" is an interjection
What do you want?
You suck dude!
I have to tell you everything!
I think I'm gonna go to sleep
We're meeting up tomorrow?
I'll be back in an hour
Is it far from here?
These things aren't mine!
Thanks, that's all
It's not my fault!
I'd like to stay for one night
Could you dial for me?
Where are the showers?
Open your mouth!
Is it bad?
He's very sexy
Pass me the salt, please.
Here you are.
Stop asking me for a drink!
It's so annoying!
So annoying..
Look at me when I talk to you!
I'm tired
Who wants some hot chocolate?
Speak more slowly, please!
When do we arrive?
The check, please
And what are we going to do?
Tonight we're going to church
How are you?
Did you have a good trip?
I don't feel well
Call the police!
It's too expensive!
She's faking sleep
That's why she's not snoring
We're getting out of here
Merry Christmas!
What does it involve?
Don't ask what they think
I'm starving!
I'd like to study in Paris
You don't know who I am
Why don't you eat vegetables?
I'm undressing
Who searches, finds
Rome wasn't built in a day
Have you finished?
I don't understand German
Don't worry, be happy!
Face life with a smile!
I'm beside myself with joy
He's already a man
I'm afraid to fall
That's the absolute truth
It's cold
I'm thirsty
You did this intentionally!
You didn't tell him anything?
You're my type
You're irresistible
Who am I talking with?
Smile now, cry later!
I can't take it anymore!
This baby penguin is too cute!
I'm at the hospital
Let's face it, it's impossible
We're never gonna make it
But, in practice, there is
I don't want to go to school
It's over between us
Give me back my ring!
She's really smart, isn't she?
Hello?
Are you still here?
It doesn't mean anything!
You met him at the university?
Aaah!!
My computer is broken!
I won't lose!
I think I'm gonna sneeze
He won't beat me
Stop criticizing me!
Come on!
Talk to me, Trang
I'm almost done
Take the other chair!
I'm not inspired anymore
It's driving me crazy
It's all dark outside
What happened?
What are you talking about?
When are we eating?
I'm hungry!
I can't believe it!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
He's rich
He doesn't need money!
He's sleeping like a baby
They're making too much noise
I can't concentrate
You're sick
So what if I am gay?
Is it a crime?
I don't want to fail my exams
Yes!
I won twice in a row!
I'm tired of eating fast food
Where is the bathroom?
I'm crazy about you
I don't know what is worse
Who buys this type of art?
Why can't we tickle ourselves?
I'm too lazy to do my homework
Have you got a beard already?
I want an MP3 player!
What?!
You ate my chocolate bear?!
Where are you?
You piss me off!
No way!
It's a dead end
Life is not long, it is wide!
Take a break; go eat lunch
I'm running out of ideas
Don't forget about us!
Which is your luggage?
The entrée includes a beverage
Who painted this painting?
I've got a pacemaker
Can I pay by credit card?
Cut, wash and dry, please
Could you please repeat that?
What did you tell her?
Where is your twenty?
Can I stay at your place?
I'm frightened of the old ones
Kyoto and Nara, for instance
Do you have a pen on you?
Whose is this?
It's a good deal
Put your hands down!
The sooner, the better
He doesn't look his age
Do you like rap?
I've been waiting for hours
He's an old timer
That's the snag
I don't know him
She's rolling in money
It's not important
I don't care
I don't like these remarks
I'm not convinced at all
I'm going to take my car
It's too good to be true
Like father, like son
I was expecting it!
There's no doubt
There isn't any solution
I didn't know he drank so much
It's well done
Do you want fruit juice?
He's a good person
Enjoy your meal!
I've got a frog in my throat
Why aren't you coming with us?
I can't say the opposite
I don't want it anymore
I'm going to take a bath
Would you like to come?
How much is it?
I'll pay by cheque
Did you leave a tip?
Don't forget the ticket
I'm sorry, I don't have change
They don't even know why
Who is coming with me?
On your feet, children!
The film started at 2 o'clock
The film lasted 2 hours
I'm glad to see you back
How beautiful you are!
Who are those guys?
I don't agree with him
Who said that?
It's totally wrong!
Can somebody help me?
I will.
You've given me your cold
Ah!
I hope he'll be able to come!
I'd like to see him
It's not worth it
Tell me about it!
Let's go, dudes
I'm taking a walk in a park
Where have you been?
Here comes the bride!
It's been snowing all night
He was born on July 28th, 1888
If you will come this way..
How did your interview go?
Do you have some paper?
I can't believe my eyes
Do you have any siblings?
No, I'm an only child.
Are you angry at what I said?
Can you do bookkeeping?
Fuji?
Can you keep a secret?
You are tired, and so am I
You are tired, aren't you?
Are you not tired?
You must help her, and soon!
You asked after her?
What did she say?
Did you meet her?
Unlike her, you are diligent
You'll come to like her
You shouldn't look down on him
You're required to help them
Are you younger than him?
Can you swim as fast as he?
Do you know who he is?
I'm certain of your success
Can you ride a horse?
You can't ride a horse
You don't have a temperature
Must you work on Sunday?
Are you a Japanese student?
Do you keep a diary?
Do you know how to cook meat?
You know the answer?
Do you live here?
Do you have bread for lunch?
You won't be late, will you?
Who are you waiting for?
Whom are you speaking of?
Are you meeting someone here?
I'm proud of you
Can you throw a fastball?
Do you believe war will start?
Can you eat raw oysters?
You didn't have to dress
Are you fond of swimming?
Do you believe in God?
Are you in jest or in earnest?
You're going too far
Are you writing a letter?
Can you drive a car?
Are you sure of your facts?
Do you take me for a fool?
You lied to me, didn't you?
Did you call me up last night?
Did you go out last night?
Why were you absent yesterday?
Aren't you tired?
You'd better not go out today
You're coming with us now
What are you about now?
Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
Can you get by on your wages?
You'd better start now
It's necessary for you to go
You'd better not go
Are you happy?
You're off in your reckoning
I suppose you're hungry
Have you ever been to Kyushu?
You'd better hurry up
I think that you're wrong
You've done a perfect job
Would you like to go abroad?
Do you plan to go abroad?
Will you stay at home?
What grade are you in?
How many books do you have?
What are you looking for?
What are you looking at?
What do you learn?
What do you intend to do?
What are you going to be?
What do you want to be?
What will you have?

What woke you up?
What do you like?
What do you want now?
Do you belong to any clubs?
Do you love music?
Do you have any pencils?
Do you study English?
You can swim, can't you?
Can you swim?
You can't swim, can you?
You're in luck
What are you driving at?
Did you read it at all?
You'll never be alone
You are strong-minded
You've done it!
You've set a bad example
Don't you like apples?
You don't like love stories
How dare you speak like that?
How dare you say that?
You're really a hard worker
Have you ever seen a UFO?
Do you like Mozart's music?
It's high time you got going
You haven't changed at all
Have you got a pen?
You will not take Bob's advice
Can you speak French?
You'd better go by bus
What a man you are!
How tall you are!
How kind you are!
How rude of you!
How lucky you are!
You're such a cute boy
Do you want anything?
Why can't you come?
Why did you try to run away?
Why do you accuse my son?
What a good thing you say!
How often do you go abroad?
How long will you stay here?
You're a friend of Tom's, eh?
How do you get to school?
Which club do you belong to?
How high can you jump?
How tall are you?
That's very sweet of you
Which bed do you want to use?
It's about time you got here!
Which one do you take?
Where were you?
Do you feel at home anywhere?
How about you?
What are you doing?
How did you come to know her?
Why did you say such a thing?
What have you come here for?
What has brought you here?
You don't know German, do you?
Do you not play tennis?
You've been had
You needn't have taken a taxi
Are you able to type?
You shouldn't do such a thing
Who did you give it to?
Were you to take it back?
Have you finished it?
Do you have one?
What did you open it with?
You shouldn't have done it
You needn't do it at once
When did you finish it?
Do you know the reason?
Could you solve the problem?

She's a stubborn woman
She's a determined woman
He's a master craftsman
Best regards, Silja
I didn't tell anybody about it
It's the only one in the world
She's not a child anymore
He's not a child anymore
Why did no one warn me?
He doesn't work for us anymore
It's the only one I know of
You're just a little too frank
I'll go crazy if this keeps on
I'll be there on the fourth
Do you have any free passes?
I'm going to go right away
Let's go out for a while
Let's get some fresh air
Don't go to any trouble
Do you often go to town?
Why didn't anyone warn me?
I'm dead broke
Don't worry about this problem
Don't panic
No problem, I'll drive.
There's just one problem
It's not Tom's problem
It's mine
It's not my problem
It's yours
It's not my problem
It's Tom's
You've obviously got a problem
We'll look into these problems
There's another slight problem
There shouldn't be any problem
The location isn't the problem
That doesn't solve the problem
Stop looking for problems, Tom
Like I said, we have a problem
It's Tom I have a problem with
It's not going to be a problem
It's me Tom has a problem with
It's just a mechanical problem
It won't be any problem at all
If you have any problems, call
If there are problems, call me
I've had problems with my boss
I'm not sure there's a problem
Why should there be a problem?
What if the problem isn't Tom?
What exactly was your problem?
We've got this problem licked
We've got problems of our own
We've got a problem back here
There's one problem with this
There's no problem whatsoever
There's just one tiny problem
There's just one problem here
That's your problem, not mine
That's likely to be a problem
That's an interesting problem
That's a very complex problem
That wasn't much of a problem
That shouldn't be any problem
That isn't Tom's only problem
Maybe the problem is you, Tom
Maybe that's the real problem
It's not your problem, anyway
It's not just a minor problem
Is this really such a problem?
Is this going to be a problem?
Is there some sort of problem?
Is there some kind of problem?
Is that going to be a problem?
I've got no problem with that
I'm well aware of the problem
I think it won't be a problem
Does Tom have mental problems?
Do you have a problem with me?
Anyway, it's not your problem
All Tom's problems are solved
You'll have no more problems
Wouldn't that cause problems?
What's your problem with Tom?
What's Tom's problem with me?
What seems to be the problem?
We've got some problems here
We're working on the problem
We're having engine problems
We couldn't find the problem
The problem's not on our end
That's going to be a problem
That's bound to be a problem
That wasn't the only problem
Obviously, there's a problem
Maybe that's not the problem
Is there a problem with this?
Is there a problem with that?
Is it a very serious problem?
I heard about Tom's problems
Do you understand my problem?
Did Tom mention any problems?
Why is that still a problem?
Who has a problem with that?
What's the problem with Tom?
What's the problem now, Tom?
What exactly is the problem?
We've got a problem up here
There's no problem with Tom
There's a problem with that
That's not our only problem
That's not a problem at all
That's how I solve problems
That's a pretty big problem
That shouldn't be a problem
See what the problem is, OK?
Let's not look for problems
It's not a computer problem
Is there a problem with Tom?
Is there a problem out here?
I've got problems of my own
I'm good at problem solving
I guess we've got a problem
Hey, that's not our problem
Has Tom ever been a problem?
Can you correct the problem?
And what's your problem now?
Your problem's not with me
What if the problem is Tom?
We've resolved the problem
We've got our own problems
We'll work the problem out
There's one little problem
The problem here isn't Tom
That's not our problem now
That's not my problem, Tom
That's no longer a problem
That's my problem with Tom
My problem is I'm too busy
It's Tom who's the problem
It's not a problem anymore
It's my problem, not yours
It's going to be a problem
Is there a problem with it?
I think we've got problems
I didn't have any problems
Are there problems at home?
We've got another problem
There's one small problem
The problem's been solved
The problem here isn't me
That's one problem solved
That's becoming a problem
That's a delicate problem
Maybe that's your problem
It's the same old problem
It's not a problem, is it?
It's not a problem at all
It's just a minor problem
It shouldn't be a problem
I'd say we have a problem
Do we have a problem here?
What's Tom's problem now?
What's the problem today?
We've got a real problem
There's only one problem
There's just one problem
There's a slight problem
Then what's your problem?
That's the whole problem
That's the other problem
That's a strange problem
Money's always a problem
Maybe that's the problem
Is this a budget problem?
Is there a problem there?
What's the problem, Tom?
What's the problem here?
We've got a big problem
There's no problem here
There's another problem
Then what's the problem?
That's not your problem
Money isn't the problem
Like I said, no problem
It's not a problem, Tom
It's my biggest problem
Is there a problem, Tom?
Is there a problem here?
I can do it, no problem
How big a problem is it?
Anyway, it's my problem
And what's your problem?
You're not the problem
Tom, what's your problem?
There's a problem here
The problem isn't that
The problem isn't ours
That's not our problem
So, where's the problem?
It's not Tom's problem
It's a complex problem
I don't have a problem
Tom isn't the problem
There's a big problem
The problem isn't Tom
So, what's the problem?
Now it's your problem
Look, it's my problem
It's your problem now
It's not your problem
Is there some problem?
Why is it my problem?
That's not a problem
It's a small problem
You've got problems
There's the problem
It's not my problem
It'll be no problem
Is it a big problem?
It's a big problem
I see," said the blind man
There's no harm in looking
There's no harm in asking
Faith, unity, discipline
Don't be offended
Don't be hurt
What colour is her hair?
The train's sound faded away
He's so big!
Where do you live these days?
What a big number!
I'll eat an apple
She's so big!
I'm on holiday for four weeks
I don't buy or sell anything!
That will show them!
That will show her!
That will show him!
Mom, Tom ate my cookie
That's super cute!
Why didn't he call me back?
Why didn't you call me back?
Why didn't she call me back?
This leaf-blower is noisy
May I carry you in my arms?
She doesn't close the door
Why can't I do it, too?
What does he need?
What must he have?
That's what my mom always says
That's what my mom always said
That's what my dad always says
That's what my dad always said
Let's try it
He's a snob about wine
Do you believe in miracles?
Wait, what are you doing here?
Wait, why are you here?
Oh, I just remembered
The library's closed tomorrow
I can't stop shaking my leg
Don't make such a mean face
One word and you're a dead man
Don't go near the edge
There's no need to shout
Tom retired at 65
Tom retired when he was 65
What's Tom's profession?
I want those shoes!
I'm trying to be reasonable
Which shoes do you want?
Don't worry
It won't happen again
It seemed never-ending
It's great when you're in love
You don't need to thank me
You're not obliged to thank me
Oh shit!
I've lost my keys!
She doesn't need anything
I don't need a car
You shouldn't do that
What's your room number?
You shouldn't talk to him
You shouldn't have gone
Do you have a book?
Is there a shop here?
Is there a shop there?
How should I say this to her?
You can't change who you are
I can't change what I feel
Tom's car is expensive
Tom's wife is called Mary
Tom, please hand me the hammer
Don't leave the light on
I'm now in New York
Tom!
How nice to see you again!
That's not difficult to do
I'll try to arrive early
What do you do on Fridays?
What size are you?
These pants don't suit me
Mary doesn't like Tom
Why do you always blame me?
Tom is Mary's lover
Tom's had his house painted
Don't say that about her
She's my girlfriend
If you're tired, go to sleep!
What do we smoke?
Do you get paid for this?
Why did you return home today?
For our friendship!
May it be so!
Tom's voice is so sexy!
That's not what I mean
It's been a nice trip
I'm not in the mood for jokes
I don't share your opinion
It's been a nice trip overall
You're very late
She's coming to pick me up
Can you get an interpreter?
Where are the soldiers?
Don't complain about it
You've asked for it
May I use the restroom?
Don't swear!
Don't cuss!
Did you get married?
She's such a hypocrite
He's such a boob
It's for the greater good
Don't run around the pool
It's basically the same thing
Don't touch it
It's white hot
You're living in the past
Who's playing the guitar?
Eat that bread!
Excuse me, it's not a mistake?
You are so brave!
You are so courageous!
Did you call me?
Please, call him
You're better than me
Do you love her?
Does the man feed the cat?
I'm talking about you
But why doesn't she shut up?
Put your hands on your head!
Are you mad at me?
We can't tell anybody
I've never cheated on her
I wish I'd bought this bag
What's your Skype login name?
You shouldn't have lied to me
You didn't teach me
You haven't taught me
You didn't trust me
You haven't trusted me
I haven't lied to you
I'm ready
And you?
I'm ready for the war
I'm ready for fighting
Does he love me?
Does she love me?
Don't laugh at her mistake
We're very interested
Did you send them?
Dance you shall, dance—!
Don't cut off my head!
I shall win the Princess!
How can I be of service?
What are you busy with?
Are these studless tyres?
He didn't pay him any visit
He didn't pay her any visit
She didn't pay her any visit
She didn't pay him any visit
Are you saying I'm a liar?
Are you calling me a liar?
Sorry, I'm bad at explaining
How can you stand the noise?
That's super easy
That's very easy
Why did you arrive in Japan?
That's painfully true
You brought him some cognac?
I'm very happy to have met you
Let's meet at the usual place
Hurry!
The concert is starting!
She's reading Chinese
Tom can't read yet
Tom can't write yet
He's a stubborn person
I've had the flu since Monday
Is your head full of straw?
You are my true friend!
Write to me if you're coming
At last, the rain stopped
Are my clothes already dry?
You're tired this evening
Right now I'm looking for work
I've had the flu since Monday
No, I'm not well
Don't run around the house
I'm not twenty years old yet
They're perfect for each other
Does he hate me?
I can't stop listening to it
In other words, he's lazy
I'm often here
What should I do!
Has anybody called the police?
I have.
She's wearing plain clothes
I've lost my wallet
What does her father do?
What does his father do?
Alas! this fear was realized
I don't take any medicine
Oh that I had never been born!
Last year, my dad passed away
No one's told me anything
Indeed, there were seven of us
It's clear as water
I wonder: Why is she late?
He's pretty cute
She's pretty cute
You've got a nice smile
Is she prettier than me?
This is grass-fed organic beef
Don't rest on your laurels!
My balloon popped!
Tell me, how did he get that?
I'm always home on Sunday
I'm a student, but he isn't
Did he already fall asleep?
Where was she at that moment?
Do you like studying?
I've got a book
He's a good lad
Why are they in the church?
Where is Hakata station?
Why didn't you take the bus?
When did the postman arrive?
Has she got married before?
Has he got married before?
Do you know Phoenix?
I'm so stupid
It's a piece of history!
How did he feel yesterday?
How did she feel yesterday?
I'm not sure
My German is not good enough.
The whole town will know!
Guys... really?
I can't believe she did that!
I can't believe you did that!
I can't believe he did that!
I can't believe I did that!
That's what everyone does
There's nothing else to do
Did you call me today?
I'm making a wish for you
It's not my case
Bon voyage!
Has she gotten married before?
Has he gotten married before?
You're going to ruin your eyes
Can you please be quiet?
Whatever happens, don't panic
Oh, that's me!
Is this your husband?
Shut up!
We'll miss the best part
Can you touch the bottom?
I hope I'm not being a bother
Please accept my condolences!
It's just a spiral-bound book
Tah dah !
Tah dah!
From you I didn't expect it!
Hey, it's me
You could at least knock!
Will you buy something?
Are you an idiot or what?
Is that your dog over there?
When I woke up, it was snowing
I hope I'm not bothering you
Then you were alone, right?
You were lying, right?
Why did I not know this?
Who the hell is Adam Kadmon?
It didn't actually happen
It's not blood - it's ketchup
Sometimes, he's very strange
Vote for my pic!
I know that you're very angry
He's an authority in his field
A man can't escape his past
It's a parody
I work on a farm," said Tom
He lives down on 4th avenue
How sexy she is!
Where did you all lose them?
Whatcha doin' Friday?
Eat your broccoli!
Did you eat all your broccoli?
No!
I hate broccoli!
You all didn't teach me
It's a fact of life
It's Saturday night
We don't have any privacy
I don't have any privacy
You're a funny one
I can't trust my textbook
We don’t mean to talk shop
Is he here yet?
What was the name of the girl?
What was the girl's name?
What is this jeans?
Wow, that girl's gorgeous!
My is it cloudy today!
Wow!
This thing isn't alive
Someone will see us!
I'm afraid someone will see us
It's quiet
What's this doing here?
I need to find her now!
Thanks, it was fun!
What could she mean?
I can't go without seeing him
It's not a crow
It's a raven
I can't remember anything
It's just one big blur
Have you ever been in Okinawa?
Is he a friend?
Is she a friend?
Are you my friend?
Am I your friend?
Is she my friend?
Is he my friend?
He can't do anything else
No, I'm not a teacher
I'm only a student
Yes, this exam is quite tough
How do I erase a sentence?
What's the name of this river?
Hello, who is speaking?
There's simply not enough time
How I love this pilot!
Leave the suitcase there!
Without a doubt he'll come
There's time
Do you have this in blue?
Can I call you Eli?
How does he make money?
Didn't you meet her there?
Do you have any friends?
I won't waste my time
Same difference", he said
We're avid RVers
It's just a bb gun
That's what they did
That's why they did it
Have you never eaten a kiwi?
That's the main thing
I'm not making him an omelette
I'd like to book a double room
It'll soon be spring
Don't forget!
I'm baking
What a cute couple!
You're already there, right?
It's a vocation
I look like I'm drunk
I'm so ugly
Did she like that dinner?
I haven't forgotten her
Everyone for themselves!
I didn't expect any gift
Mom, do farts weigh anything?
No, sweety.
Then I pooped my pants.
It's easy to hear you
I've got my hair dyed black
I've gotten my hair dyed black
What beautiful weather!
Tom went home at 6:30
You look fantastic!
I don't like sleeping alone
I don't like living alone
It proves he's not a robot
Where the hell can he be?
It's worse than that
You've got to try harder
Who answered the phone?
Don't play with the mud
You're getting dirty
I don't tan very easily
I don't want to go out
I don't want to go out
What are the dates?
Look at the distant horizon!
Could you be my teacher?
One kiss or two?
Better run away immediately!
Which street did you follow?
Welcome to China!
Which street did you take?
I don't blame you a bit
What accent have I got?
What's all this crap?
It just doesn't work that way
Don't play with his feelings!
Don't play with her feelings!
Let's hope not
Cook 2 Japanese cups of rice
Who told you that?
Well, that's adorable
Where is Melbourne?
I know I'm guilty of this
Where is Canberra?
You're too cute
Therefore, Tom will die
Everything is ready!
Therefore, Tom is mortal
Why is this?
Who cares?
How's your chest?
Science can't explain this
She didn't last long
Tom lost his colleagues' trust
Cook 300 grams of rice
Cook about 12 ounces of rice
Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte.
Correct!
Was it a nice trip?
She's sitting on the bench
Can I have your mobile number?
Go shave, you'll look better
C++, Java and a little PHP
What about you, Mary?
French, Japanese and Hebrew.
You're reading my mind
I can't write you in private!
Hurry up!
Eh?
When did it start raining?
I didn't notice at all
Should I quit my job?
I'm not good at self-promotion
This is so cool!
You'd better not do that again
He's sitting on the bench
Come on, let's have a go
Never call me again!
I'm being polite
Did you like me?
Join if you're a musician
He died.
Are the fingers yours?
Are the toes yours?
And even Scotland is ours!
It's not clear
Oh no, I shrunk my t-shirt
I shrunk my T-shirt
What should I do?
Don't be shy
Come on, Tom
Don't be shy
What does it remind you of?
It's not a crow, nor a raven
It's a magpie
This is Tom's pet turtle
She's called Mary
He's cute but stupid
He's stupid, but cute
Where did you get that tan?
How would you feel?
It's rat meat
Do you own a pharmacy?
You'll make the boys go crazy!
What a change!
Have you seen my recipe book?
The car won't start
Will you help me push the car?
What do you guys think?
I'm plowing the soil
Men don't read instructions
Do you read instructions?
Have you no shame?
What trickery is this?
We need it for our room!
Imagine being that baby!
Where can we buy it?
How about this for your room?
Where do you get those lamps?
Don't let my son see this!
This is his baby's room!
See what the humans can do!
I'm a free radical
I'm not cool
I'm more famous
I'm less famous
I'm as famous as you
I'd like to know your opinion
What if you fall asleep?
I can't agree with Tom
I don't really watch TV
How can I make you happier?
Hit the brakes!
We've missed our train
Where did you go?
Don't forget
Is there some sort of trick?
It's alright
This injection won't hurt
I don't like that idea
It's not size that matters
It's not size that matters
It's how you use it
A ten thousand dollar fine?
That's nothing
That's me!
A one million yen fine?
That's nothing to me
Sorry, but I've already won
What will you do in college?
It's time to do something
Enjoy Edinburgh!
Tom doesn't speak
Don't cry
Crying doesn't solve anything
Either way, you lose
What song is she playing?
We don't know any songs
I don't know any French songs
He's an idiot sometimes
She's an idiot sometimes
What happened that night?
I don't think he's gay
I didn't know what to expect
I can't believe no one died
But it doesn't matter
This project is shovel-ready
It's still true today
He doesn't even have a car
He's the French president
What's her nationality?
This task is labor-intensive
You're more than welcome
You shouldn't complain
I've got only myself to blame
Tom runs 10 kilometers a day
Better run away right now!
I'm assuming you're American
Do I need to make a speech?
Me too.
Is that what you want, Tom?
Let's look at that first
My daughter's your age
She's a weird one
I like him, but he's weird
He's got a steady girlfriend
Don't get scrappy
He's quick with girls
It's outside my expertise
Where's the motorway entrance?
Enjoy your work!
What kind is it?
Poor thing!
Thanks, the same to you!
Hello?
Whom am I speaking to?
No, you're wrong
When is the test?
Can I go to my locker?
What's the matter?
Why are you so glum?
All together!
Once more!
Repeat!
Open your books!
Close your books!
Yes, I understand
May I go to the fountain?
May I go to the nurse?
At what time?
Good evening, Madam
Good evening, Sir
Good night, Miss
It's debatable
It's questionable
I'm the one who saved Tom
It's as true as death
He's still breathing
She's still breathing
What game is it?
I'm just really happy
She's a fast thinker
It's a rook
It's not a crow, but a jackdaw
I don't have room for dessert
Tom wasn't at the meeting
What a bore!
How boring!
Tom got a 100% in chemistry
He's easy to handle
He's easily controlled
He's in military service
He's an hopeless idiot
Don't ever look at me again
I'm not good at giving advice
Is everything alright here?
Tom's stomach growled
Does he still have baby teeth?
I don't speak English
Can you repeat, please?
Can you speak slowly, please?
Can you speak up?
How do you pronounce it?
Can you write it for me?
May you win!
I was right too, then!
I don't like to sing at all
I'm about to pee
What would you rather do?
I'm Francesco
I always go to school at 7:15
That's not true!
The insolence of it!
From bad to worse!
I demand an investigation!
And that's it!
He's a landlubber
What is this world coming to?
What is the world coming to?
He's asking for it
Is Santa Claus real?
Mr. White is a rational man
Actually, I didn't know that
He's really mean
Pfft!
How old is she?
You'd better hurry
I'm only here by mistake
Which street may I start with?
Do you see what you did to me?
Do you have any food?
Can I get a goodnight kiss?
I think we're safe now
I think we're out of danger
But are we really sure?
I'm of the same opinion
Did you see our new website?
It's a mistaken opinion
Let's go by train
Is it direct?
Is he direct?
I'm very well
I'm so-so
Lightning struck Tom's house
I am 12 years old
He's eleven years old
She's eleven years old
It's eleven years old
He is 100 years old
She is 100 years old
It is 100 years old
You're everywhere!
It's ten o'clock
Ugh!
I can't agree with you more
Is the bank open today?
What time does the bank open?
I'm trying to work
Where's Mark?
He's having a shower
Let's go out now
It isn't raining any more
What's all that noise?
What's going on?
I'm not sure there's a God
Why are you locking the door?
Why am I so nice to everyone?
It's normal in Germany
This is normal in Germany.
Really?
You're coming with us!
You're coming with me!
He's coming with us
She's coming with us
She's coming with me
He's a barbecue aficionado
I don't hate my sister
I don't hate my brother
I'm not a celebrity
I'm wearing sunglasses
I wanna love you forever!
It's normal in Brazil
I'm in seventh heaven
He's got terrible handwriting
I'll meet her tomorrow
I'll meet Tom tomorrow at 2:30
I've forgotten my password
I want to love you forever!
Are you still angry at me?
Who are you talking to?
She doesn't eat much
Do you think that he is dead?
Life hasn't been easy
Your name's not Tom, is it?
Your name isn't Tom, is it?
I'm a swimmer
I'm swimming in the ocean
You're working hard today
Go ahead alone!
What are the positive sides?
I'm behind the kitchen
I'm on cloud nine
For now I'm feeling fine
Why am I so sleepy?
I wonder why I'm so sleepy
I wonder why I'm so tired
She's got terrible handwriting
I believe he's gay
That's no way to treat a guest
I'll give Tom half of my share
Will you hand me that pencil?
God knows what we'll do next
It's a gray stone building
How much is that gold ring?
That actor's quite a ham
Are you leaving for good?
What is the grand total?
What grade do you teach?
Could I borrow a hammer?
Shall I cut it in half?
I'll be back in half an hour
I'll be back in 30 minutes
Who's your favorite singer?
How could anyone be so stupid?
Do you think I'm that stupid?
How stupid do you think I am?
That's a stupid thing to say
Tom said I'm ugly and stupid
You'd be stupid to trust Tom
That's a really stupid idea
How could Tom be so stupid?
Are you calling me stupid?
Do you think we're stupid?
Don't you feel stupid now?
Is Tom really that stupid?
We know you're not stupid
We're not all that stupid
Did I do anything stupid?
How can Tom be so stupid?
How could I be so stupid?
That's a stupid question
It wasn't a stupid idea
It's a stupid tradition
Does that sound stupid?
Do I look that stupid?
It's a stupid policy
That's a stupid idea
That's a stupid rule
I'm not that stupid
Why was I so stupid?
It's a stupid rule
It's a stupid law
Do I look stupid?
Are you stupid?
I'm not a good person
Am I not beautiful?
Why did you come this early?
Why did you come so early?
Would you like to come?
Could you come back later?
You're very early this morning
You're the tallest person here
You're stronger than you think
You're my friends, both of you
You're much taller than Tom is
You're better than all of them
We'll be at home all day today
They're discussing the problem
They'll get married next month
There's nothing wrong with you
There's always something to do

There's one piece left
The next one's on me
The next one's for you
That's the one I liked
That's the one I hate
That's an unusual one
That's an easy one
That's a tricky one
That's a funny one
That one's my favorite
That one's good
That one's for me, too
That's the only one I had left
Thanks, I owe you one
Should I have one?
Let's try one
Let's try a different one
Let's do one thing at a time
It's the wrong one
It's the only one I had
It's one of those
It's not either one of those
It's a strange one
It's a pretty good one
It's a fake one, right?
If you find one, let me know
I've got the wrong one here
I've got one of these
I've already done step one
I'm sure it's a good one
I'm not the crazy one
I think we've found one
I didn't get one either
I couldn't sell the last one
How do I get one of those?
Here's the one I forgot
Here's one I forgot
Here's a good one for you
Here, this one's yours
Have you seen one?
Have you ever dropped one?
Grab me one, too
From now on, you're one of us
Do you think I need one?
Do you mean this one?
Do you have one of these?
Do you have an extra one?
Do you have a real one?
Do I need one?
Can I say one thing?
Can I order one?
Can I just say one thing?
Can I have one of those?
Can I have another one?
Aren't you the sly one?
Are you the one who saved me?
Did you mean what you said?
You just now noticed this?
Why did you say what you said?
Who cares what Tom says?
Who cares what Tom said?
Well, that's what Tom said
That's what you said last year
That's what you said last week
That's what you said last time
That's what you said before
That's what Tom said, too
Let's do what Tom said
I don't care what Tom says
I'm not going to go
Do you remember what you said?
Do you remember what Tom said?
Did you hear what Tom said?
It's rainy again
Why would I care where Tom is?
We're not sure where Tom is
Watch where you're going
That's where I met Tom
Tell me where Tom's hideout is
Is this where Tom lives?
I'll go find out where Tom is
Does Tom know where Mary is?
Do you know where Tom is now?
Is that why you're here now?
That's why you pay us
That's why Tom is here
That's why Tom got up early
That's not why you're here
Tell us why you're here
Isn't that why you're here?
Is this why you hired me?
Is that why you've stayed?
Is that why you've come?
Is that why you're upset?
Is that why you're leaving?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you were late?
Is that why you did this?
Is that why you came?
Is that why you came here?
Is that why you came back?
Is that why you called?
Is that why you called me?
Do you know why you're here?
Do you know why Tom did it?
What's written on this sheet?
It's a slippery slope
This can't be the truth
That can't be!
Seriously?
What you're saying is true
That's true too, isn't it?
That's not exactly true
That's just not true
Tom's father was never around
Tom kept his father's notes
The weather's nice today
Don't forget the sunhat
You're not fooling anyone
What is Tom doing?
Master, remember the Athenians
Come and take it!
Don't you find me attractive?
I don't want him here
I don't want her here
Tom, apologize to your sister
You made your sister cry!
I'm not bossy!
Do you think he's okay?

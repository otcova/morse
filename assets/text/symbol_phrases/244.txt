You can't give up like this
How many sandwiches were left?
I'm not tempting you
Is there wine?

Don't eat that!
Very well, thank you
How is your health?

Yes, the computer is faulty
I can't live this way
I can't lead this lifestyle
He isn't working on anything
Don't tell him how old I am
May I have a glass of milk?
Don't tell Tom how old I am
The horse is old, but healthy
Tom didn't call me as promised
Leave me alone!
Can't you see I'm busy?
Are you pleased?
He's balded a bit
Beware the Ides of March!
It won't be simple for you
Was I supposed to do it?
Is there anything else to do?
Ah, indeed it is
That's not so silly at all
Who wants to bet on it?
Who wants to bet against?

Why is he wearing a cape?
Do you guys hear that?
I'll admit, I'm strange
That's a huge TV
Why would I want a bigger TV?
I don't need more stuff
I don't need expensive gadgets
He couldn't even lift my dog!
I'll try and find Tom for you
Luckily, the weather was good
What can I do for you, sir?
I don't play tennis
I don't walk to school
I didn't watch TV last night
I'm not listening to music now
Let's wait till Tom gets here
Whose flashlight is this?
How often do you go to movies?
I think I'm on the wrong bus
How old is your refrigerator?
It's delicious
I'm happy for both of you
Should we call an ambulance?
Should you call an ambulance?
Did I sing that song okay?
For you, I will do it gladly
Today, we celebrate Africa day
Do you love that song?
Do you love this song?
Obliterate them!
Why should we hire you?
You're in for a treat
I can't cook at all
What is her age?
I've heard this joke already
I haven't abandoned hope yet
Haven't you learned anything?
Doesn't it look a little odd?
Why is my name on this list?
There's no doubt in my mind
I hope I don't let you down
How much does all this cost?
Do you want to visit Boston?
Do you know who that man is?
Did you talk to anyone else?
So, what happened, exactly?
I know what's good for you
I don't have many problems
Did you think that was fun?
Are you willing to do this?
So, what needs to be done?
So, what exactly happened?
Shall I get out my guitar?
Now why didn't we do that?
Have you ever heard of it?
Evidently, that's a crime
Do you two get along well?
Do you think I enjoyed it?
Do you think I don't know?
Tom doesn't like to be ignored
Do you see a pattern here?
Do you have proof of that?
Do you have an MP3 player?
Tom isn't working on anything
Do you drive a hybrid car?
Do we have to do all this?
I know that Tom can't do that
Do we have to do all that?
Do I look like an invalid?
Nobody laughs at Tom's jokes
Did we do the right thing?
Did they get the job done?
Could any of that be true?
I have feelings for you, Tom
Can we ever truly be free?
So, what exactly did Tom do?
Are you tired of this yet?
So, what does Tom look like?
Are you going to the game?
Are you going to be ready?
I knew Tom wouldn't do that
Are they getting stronger?
Are they from out of town?
Was Tom having a good time?
I haven't been fired yet
Is Tom likely to come back?
Have you learned nothing?
Hasn't Tom suffered enough?
Did you tell anyone else?
Tom's jokes are offensive
Did you meet anyone else?
So, what else can we do?
I haven't yet done that
Tom isn't a very nice guy
Did you see anyone else?
Did you hit anyone else?
Tom's jokes aren't funny
What was going on here?
Who was Tom shooting at?
Who is that young guy?
I have three ex-wives
Did Tom ask you to help?
Tom can read, can't he?
I ignored Tom's advice
How do we get started?
I got out of Tom's way
Do you love me at all?
Hasn't Tom done enough?
I have a half-sister
Do you two get along?
I left home at 2:30
I graduated in 2013
What was the score?
I like skiing, too
I know you're here
I know that's true
We don't want to tip them
Home!
You won't talk
You are becoming rude!
We are lost!
You need to start!
I'd like a coffee, please
How much is that VR headset?
There's an app for that
Layla didn't see anybody else
Layla's car was still running
That's why Layla is here

This isn't my native dialect
This is treason!
This is mutiny!
Hand me my sword!
Where are my arrows?
Where is my bow?
Where is my quiver?
Hand me that sword!

I'll be free all day Monday
Is it just a fad?
What mediocre propaganda!
Tom can't stop translating
Don't be a schmuck

There's a bully at school
Want to go to the pizza place?
He didn't buy bread

Can't I do it tomorrow?
I promise I'll do it tomorrow
Don't you answer me back
I'm your father
It's not a new idea
What were you thinking, Tom?
Did you use protection?
You've been manipulating me
It will end well, never fear!
It'll turn out fine
Don't be afraid
That wasn't directed at you
Tom's was blue, Mary's red
This store's water is filtered
Would you like them?
The meeting will start at 2:30
The concert will start at 2:30
You're being sarcastic, right?
Would you like to do that now?

I've been there and done that
How long did the meeting last?
Does anybody want to buy this?
Do I need to worry about that?
Are you guys ready to do that?
Are you going to study French?
Is it all right if I do this?
I wouldn't give up so easily
Does your room have a closet?
Did you just figure that out?
Did you have to share a room?
Did you expect me to do that?
Can't we do better than that?
Can we trust a man like that?
Can anyone out there help me?
Can I ask the first question?
Boy, I wish I had known that?
Are you going to cook supper?
Are we doing the best we can?
Would you like to know more?
Will that happen right away?
Why do you think I did that?
Is it the wrong thing to do?
Is it the right thing to do?
Is it OK if I don't do that?
Is it OK if I don't come in?
I wouldn't have bought that
Hasn't this happened before?

Are you up to the challenge?
Are you prepared to do this?
Are you happy where you are?
Are you going to vote today?
Are you already on the team?
Am I the only one who cares?
You can't do that, can you?
Which way is the right way?
We didn't actually do that
Was that a fun thing to do?
Shall I light the fire now?
It's starting to get light
Is that really a good idea?
Is it getting warm in here?
Is everyone ready for this?
Is anyone going to read it?

Could that be a good thing?
Tom's favorite drink is coffee
Can I help you in some way?
Tom wouldn't give up so easily
Can I get anything for you?
Tom wouldn't even say hi to me
Aren't you glad we did that?
Tom would've made a difference
Am I too old to learn yoga?
Would you like to read it?
Would you like to have it?
Will you keep this for me?
Will you be gone for long?
Will we have a hot summer?
Will we be gone that long?
Which guitar should I get?
Tom will do that soon, I think
It's getting warm in here
Is it possible to do that?
Guess who's paying for it
Does that still scare you?
Do you think we need this?
Do you think that's wrong?
Can we do that right away?
Are you sure that'll work?
Why is that so important?
Tom wasn't wearing a warm coat
What should be done here?
Tom wasn't very good last year
Why do you think I came?
Tom wasn't very good at sports
Who cares what they say?
Tom wasn't planning to retreat
What does all this mean?
Tom wasn't planning to give up
Tom wasn't planning to do that
Are you making progress?
Tom wasn't part of the scandal
How's the plan working?
Tom wasn't close to being done
That's a hard problem
Tom wasn't at home at the time
Does anyone want this?
Tom wasn't a very good witness
Do I need to do that?
It's a hard problem

Who gave you these glasses?
Who gave you this watch?
Who gave you this wallet?
Who gave you this credit card?
Who gave you this suitcase?
Layla's luck has run out
I'm uncomplete without you
It's a nice area to live in
I'll get you for this!
You'll pay for this!
You don't interest me
It’s just not working out
It's gotta be a joke
It's gotta be a joke, right?
It's always so nice to see you
Looks like no one's home
I'll worry about that tomorrow
Sami dated a deaf-mute woman

Layla couldn't stand Sami
I'm a changed man.
Please!
I have changed.

Would you like to be a sailor?
Would we have done any better?
Why don't you help me do this?
Why are you trying to do that?
Which option is right for you?
Was there anyone in the lobby?
They won't do that, will they?
So, what is this really about?
Let's do this again next year
Isn't this supposed to be fun?
Isn't there any place to hide?
Isn't that considered slander?
Isn't it obvious who did that?
Is this the best you could do?
Hey, can you lend a hand here?
Have you nothing to say to me?
Have you done anything at all?
Has anyone actually used this?
Has anyone actually done that?
Don't mothers do that anymore?
Does that really surprise you?
Do you want to have breakfast?
Do you really want that house?
Tom told me the truth, I think
Do you mean you want me to go?
Do you have any good examples?
Do you have any advice for us?
Do you have a lot of problems?
Do you feel a lot of pressure?
Do you even know what this is?
Tom admits he's under pressure
Do we really have to eat this?
Do people still feel that way?
Do all of us have to be there?
I won't let Tom do that to you
Did you walk from the station?
Did you not read what I wrote?
Did you ever think about that?
Did it really happen that way?
Did anybody do what you asked?
Did anybody disagree with you?
Can't you do that by yourself?
You shouldn't let Tom do that
Can you email me the location?
Why were Tom and Mary evicted?
Can anyone guess what this is?

Are you looking for a new job?
Tom wasn't keeping up with us
Are you happy with the result?
Are you doing the right thing?
Are we supposed to be shocked?

Tom isn't supposed to do that
Would you like me to do that?
Will we ever learn the truth?
Will the price keep going up?
Why isn't that happening now?
Who actually owns this house?
Which option is right for me?
Tom doesn't intend to do that
What's that next to the door?
What do you think is missing?
What do you have to do today?
Was your dad in the military?
Should you be doing that now?
Shouldn't Tom be helping Mary?
Isn't Tom supposed to do that?
No one could've stopped that

Isn't this what I need to do?
Isn't that a friend of yours?

Tom would've been happy here
Do you plan to do that again?
Do you plan on buying a copy?
Do you need some help, ma'am?
Do you like playing football?
Do you know what day this is?
Tom wasn't hurt in the fight
Do you have a lot of friends?
Do you have a favorite actor?
Do we need to do it this way?
Do they plan to use it again?
Do all of us have to do that?
Didn't you read what I wrote?
Did you help out on the farm?
Did anybody help you do that?
Tom got here just after 2:30
Can you make the text larger?
Are you sure you're up to it?
Are these questions relevant?
Tom didn't intend to do that
Any ideas on how to fix this?
Tom didn't hear the gunshots
Am I not doing this properly?
Tom didn't do that very fast
Would you like to try again?
Tom borrowed Mary's umbrella
Would you care to try again?
Why did you write this book?
It's better not to trust Tom
Who could benefit from this?
Is Tom looking for a new job?
Where are those girls going?
Is Tom going to be a teacher?
What's causing that to move?

Do you plan to use it again?
What did Tom suggest we buy?
Do you plan to study French?
Do we still need to do this?
Do I really have to do that?
Did you walk to the station?
Can you do that by yourself?
Are you guys really related?
Are you going to drink that?
Why should you care anyway?
Why are gas prices so high?
Where did you buy that cap?
Shouldn't Tom be helping us?
What's that under your arm?
Possibly Tom didn't do that
What's so weird about this?
Perhaps I've met Tom before
What does all of this mean?
No one came to Tom's rescue
We've been told what to do
Does Tom still study French?
We weren't told what to do
Do you trust Tom's judgment?
Surely you know what to do?
Do you think Tom stole that?
Now I'm even more confused
Do you think Tom is worried?
No one could've stopped me
Can we force Tom to do that?
Is this where I need to be?
Will we ever see Tom again?
How many books did you buy?
Will Tom be back next year?
How do we fix this problem?
Why can't Tom live with us?
Do you want to lose weight?
Who's Tom's French teacher?

Tom won't do that, will he?
Do we all have to be there?
Are you ready for the test?
Are we supposed to do that?
Are we supposed to be here?
Where are you going today?
Where are those boys from?
Tom said he didn't do that
What really happened here?
What do you think changed?
Tell me what's the matter
Shouldn't I be there, too?
Tom claimed he wasn't paid
Should you be eating that?
The ball is in Tom's court
No one could've done that
Should we be afraid of Tom?
